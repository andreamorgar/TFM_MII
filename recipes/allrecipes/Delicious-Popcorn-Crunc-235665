Line baking sheets with aluminum foil. Combine popcorn, cranberries, pecans, and chocolate pieces together in a bowl. Stir sugar, butter, corn syrup, and vanilla extract together in a heavy saucepan; cook and stir over medium-high heat until boiling, about 5 minutes. Boil mixture for 2 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and stir in vinegar. Pour sugar mixture over popcorn mixture; mix until evenly coated. Spread coated popcorn mixture onto prepared baking sheets; cool.
