Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place zucchini in a saucepan with enough water to cover, and boil until tender. Drain, and let stand in cold water for about 5 minutes, then drain. In a bowl, mix together eggs, sugar, flour, salt, margarine, evaporated milk, and vanilla. Add cooked zucchini. In a blender or food processor, blend until smooth and creamy (pudding like). Pour into unbaked pie shell, and sprinkle with nutmeg. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until knife comes out clean.
