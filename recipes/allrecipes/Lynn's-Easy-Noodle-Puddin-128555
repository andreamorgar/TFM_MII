Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Stir in egg noodles and cook until al dente, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 13x9 inch baking dish. Toss the cooked noodles with the sour cream, cottage cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, eggs, and raisins until well blended. Pour the noodle mixture into the prepared pan. Dot the top with small pieces of butter. Mix the remaining 1/2 cup sugar with the cinnamon. Sprinkle over the noodles. Bake in preheated oven until top is lightly brown, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven and cool 10 minutes to set pudding before serving.
