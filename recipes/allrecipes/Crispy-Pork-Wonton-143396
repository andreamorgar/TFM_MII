Combine the pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, lime juice, crushed red pepper, sesame oil, and soy sauce in a food processor. Season mixture with salt and pepper. Pulse until pork is minced to the consistency of ground beef. Separate the wonton wrappers and lay them out on a clean surface. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the pork mixture into the center of each wrapper. Moisten the edges of the wonton wrappers with water, fold over the filling to form a triangle, and press together to seal. Brush each wonton with egg white. Pour the peanut oil into a large pot and preheat to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C). Gently drop wontons into the hot oil and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove to paper towels to drain.
