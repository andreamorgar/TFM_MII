In a medium saucepan of simmering water, poach the salmon filets 10 minutes, or until flaky and tender. In a medium bowl, mix together cream cheese, sour cream, green onions, salt, hot pepper sauce, lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce. Flake salmon into the mixture. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours, or overnight, before serving.
