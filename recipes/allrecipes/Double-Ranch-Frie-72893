Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Cut potatoes into wedges or fries, and soak in a bowl with milk. Stir together the ranch dressing mix and garlic salt; place on a plate or in a bag. Drain potatoes, and roll in the seasonings to coat. Place potatoes into the deep-fryer in batches so they are not too crowded. Fry for 5 minutes, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels, and season with leftover seasoning mixture.
