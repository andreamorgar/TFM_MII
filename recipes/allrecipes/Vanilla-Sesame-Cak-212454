Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking dish. With an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar together in a mixing bowl until the mixture is creamy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, beating until each egg is incorporated before adding the next one. Stir in the vanilla extract and black sesame seeds, mixing until well blended. Lightly stir in the flour to make a smooth batter, and pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
