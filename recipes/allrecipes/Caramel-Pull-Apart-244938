Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)). Combine brown sugar, butter, milk, and cinnamon together in a saucepan over medium-low heat; cook and stir until caramel sauce is smooth, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle pecans in the bottom of the prepared pan; top with 1/2 of the caramel sauce. Layer biscuits over caramel sauce. Pour the remaining caramel sauce over biscuits. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes. Turn pan over onto a plate to serve.
