In a medium dish or bowl, mix together soy sauce, sugar, onion, garlic, ginger, sesame seeds, and oil. Add pork, and turn to coat. Cover, and refrigerate for 3 hours, turning and basting often. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Remove pork from marinade, reserving marinade, and transfer to a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake for 45 minutes. Cut into 1/4 inch thick slices. While the meat is roasting, boil reserved marinade for 3 to 5 minutes. Serve with pork strips.
