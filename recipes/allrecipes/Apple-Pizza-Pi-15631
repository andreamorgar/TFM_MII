Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cream together butter or margarine and confectioners' sugar. Add 1 cup flour and mix gently just until dough comes together. Pat evenly into a 12 inch pizza pan. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove and spread with apple pie filling. In a medium bowl, mix together cheese, 3/4 cup flour, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Sprinkle over apple filling and return pizza to oven for 25 to 30 minutes longer.
