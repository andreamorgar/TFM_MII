Place ground pork in a large bowl. Combine salt, turmeric, sage, oregano, black pepper, paprika, and marjoram in a small bowl. Sprinkle half of the seasonings over the pork. Mix well with your hands or a wooden spoon to combine. Sprinkle remaining seasonings onto the pork and mix until evenly distributed. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight. Scoop out 1/4 cup of the chilled pork mixture at a time and shape into patties. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties until no longer pink in the center and browned, about 4 minutes per side.
