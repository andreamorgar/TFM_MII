Dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Cut 1cup of the butter into the flour. Mix in the sugar, eggs and yeast mixture. Mix well and set aside to rise for 30 to 60 minutes. Roll dough into balls and bake in a pizelle iron. To Make Filling: In a saucepan boil the brown sugar, 1 cup of the butter, cinnamon and dark corn syrup until it reaches the soft ball stage (234-240 degrees F 112 -115 degrees C). Split waffles in half and spread cut sides with the warm filling. Then put the halves back together.
