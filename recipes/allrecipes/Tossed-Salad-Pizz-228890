Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Combine 1 cup flour, undissolved yeast, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Add very warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Dough should form a ball and will be slightly sticky. Knead** on a floured surface, adding additional flour if necessary, until smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. (If using RapidRise Yeast, let dough rest at this point for 10 minutes.) Pat dough with floured hands to fill greased pizza pan or baking sheet. OR roll dough on a floured counter to 12-inch circle; place in greased pizza pan or baking sheet. Form a rim by pinching the edge of the dough. Brush crust with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with garlic powder. Combine mozzarella cheese, onions and carrots; spread over the crust. Bake on lowest oven rack for 15 to 18 minutes, until cheese is bubbly and crust is browned. Remove from oven and let cool 2 to 3 minutes. While pizza is baking, toss together lettuce, tomatoes and Italian salad dressing. Spread over pizza and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately!
