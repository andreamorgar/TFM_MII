Lightly grease a 9x13 inch dish. In a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat, combine butter, sugar and milk. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Heat to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface. Remove from heat and stir in peanut butter, chocolate chips and butterscotch chips until melted. Stir in vanilla. Fold in marshmallow creme. Pour into prepared pan. Chill in refrigerator until firm.
