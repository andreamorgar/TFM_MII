In an oven safe bowl, combine artichoke hearts, chile peppers, pimento peppers, mayonnaise, Monterey Jack cheese and almost all of the Parmesan cheese; sprinkle remaining Parmesan cheese on top. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until lightly browned.
