Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk flour and 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar together in a bowl. Whisk in eggs and butter. Add 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk and lemon juice; whisk until batter is very smooth, about 3 minutes. Pour batter into a 9-inch oval or round baking dish. Scatter raspberries on top. Bake in the preheated oven until puffy and golden, about 30 minutes. Let cool, about 15 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar.
