Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease bottoms of two 9 inch round layer cake pans. In a large bowl, mix the spice cake mix, dried apples, pecans, coconut, currants, eggs, brown sugar, vanilla extract and butter. Pour the mixture into the cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. Split each cake layer into four sections. Spread apple butter between the sections and reassemble layers.
