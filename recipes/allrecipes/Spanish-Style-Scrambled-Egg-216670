Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the potatoes until just starting to turn tender, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Stir in leek and garlic; cook until the white parts of the leek are translucent, about 5 more minutes. In a bowl, beat together eggs and milk until well combined. Stir the shrimp into the skillet with the potatoes and leek, then pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low, and cook gently, stirring the eggs frequently, until the curds of egg are almost dry and the shrimp are pink and opaque, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle with hot pepper sauce to serve.
