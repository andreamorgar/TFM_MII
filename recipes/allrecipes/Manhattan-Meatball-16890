Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium-size mixing bowl, mix barbecue sauce and pineapple preserves together. In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine meat, breadcrumbs, eggs, onions, salt, and parsley. Mix well and form into bite-size balls. Arrange the balls in a single layer in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour the barbecue sauce mixture evenly over the meatballs. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes, until the meat is cooked.
