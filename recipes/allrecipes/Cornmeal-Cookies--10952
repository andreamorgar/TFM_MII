In a large bowl, blend butter and sugar until creamy. Add egg and beat well. In another bowl, stir together flour, cornmeal, baking powder and salt; gradually add to butter mixture. Add vanilla and blend thoroughly. Stir in the optional raisins. Form dough into ball, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and chill until firm, about 1 hour. Roll out dough on well-floured board to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut with cookie cutters (2 1/2 inches in diameter) and place 1 inch apart on lightly greased cookie sheet. Bake in 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven for 10-12 minutes or until edges are golden. Store in airtight container.
