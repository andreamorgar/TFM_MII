Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, stir together 1 cup flour, oats, 1 cup brown sugar, baking soda and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Rub in the 1/2 cup of butter until crumbly. Press into the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking pan. Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove and cool. Make the filling while the crust is baking. In a medium bowl, beat eggs, almond extract, 1 cup of brown sugar, 1 tablespoon of flour, baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt until smooth. Stir in the coconut, cherries and pecans. Spread over the pre-baked crust. Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until light brown. Let cool before icing. To make the icing, mix together the remaining 6 tablespoons butter, confectioners' sugar and vanilla until smooth. Gradually add the reserved cherry juice until the desired consistency is reached. Drizzle over cooled bars before cutting into squares.
