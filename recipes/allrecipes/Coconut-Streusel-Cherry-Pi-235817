Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Stir 1/4 cup sugar and cornstarch together in a saucepan; add cherries and almond-flavored liqueur. Cook and stir mixture over low heat until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Spoon mixture into pie crust. Whisk flour and 3/4 cup sugar together in a bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture until texture of coarse crumbs; stir in coconut. Sprinkle topping over filling to within 2 inches of center.
