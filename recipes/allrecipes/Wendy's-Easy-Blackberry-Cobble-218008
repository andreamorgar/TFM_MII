Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Combine the blackberries, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl until evenly blended. Spread evenly into the prepared baking dish. In a separate bowl, stir together the cake mix and margarine until crumbly. Sprinkle evenly over top of the berries. Bake in the preheated oven until the mixture is bubbly, and the topping is golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes.
