Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 1 baking sheet. Combine 1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons margarine and golden syrup in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave until margarine is melted, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Mix boiling water and baking soda in a small bowl until baking soda is dissolved. Stir into margarine mixture. Mix oats, all-purpose flour, sugar, coconut, and apricots together in a large bowl. Add water and margarine mixture; mix until dough is combined. Form dough into small balls and place on prepared baking sheet; flatten slightly. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 15 minutes.
