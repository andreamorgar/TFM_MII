Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a large bowl, whip eggs and sugar until light. Mix in the orange extract and oil. Combine the flour and baking powder; stir into the egg mixture along with the walnuts. Form dough into 4 logs and place them 3 inches apart onto an ungreased cookie sheet; flatten slightly. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden and firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and cool completely. Remove to a cutting board and slice each log into 1 inch wide diagonal slices with a serrated knife. Return the slices to the baking sheet, cut side down. Return the slices to the oven and bake for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, until toasted.
