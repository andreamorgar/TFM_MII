Spread flour on a shallow plate. Beat eggs in a bowl. Pour bread crumbs into a shallow bowl. Dredge chicken breasts in flour. Dip in egg and roll in bread crumbs to coat. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry breaded chicken breasts, 2 at a time, until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining butter and chicken breasts. Layer chicken breasts in a slow cooker, covering each layer with marinara sauce. Cook on low until flavors combine, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place chicken breasts side-by-side in a baking dish, spooning additional sauce on top. Place 2 slices mozzarella cheese over each piece of chicken. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese, oregano, basil, and garlic powder on top. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.
