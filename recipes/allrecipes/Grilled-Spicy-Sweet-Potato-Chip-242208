Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Whisk olive oil, garlic, lime juice, cumin, chili powder, salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl; add sweet potatoes and stir until thoroughly coated. Place coated sweet potatoes on the preheated grill; cook, flipping sweet potatoes every 5 minutes, until crisp around the edges and tender in the middle, 15 to 20 minutes.
