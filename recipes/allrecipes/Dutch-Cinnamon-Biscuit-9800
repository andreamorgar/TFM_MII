Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Sift the flour and cinnamon and add to the butter mixture. Spread the mixture into an ungreased baking pan measuring 11x7 inches. Beat the egg and brush over the top of the dough. Prick dough all over with a fork. Sprinkle dough with almonds and sugar. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown. Let cool on wire rack for 5 minutes before cutting into 12 bars. Store in an airtight container.
