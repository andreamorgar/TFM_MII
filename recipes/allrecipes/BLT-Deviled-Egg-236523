Place eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel. Place bacon in a large skillet; cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels; crumble bacon when cool enough to handle. Cut eggs in half lengthwise; place egg yolks in a bowl. Mash yolks with a fork; stir in crumbled bacon, mayonnaise, tomatoes, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange egg white halves on a serving platter; spoon yolk mixture into egg whites. Refrigerate, covered, until ready to serve.
