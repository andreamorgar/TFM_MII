Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a 9x13 inch baking dish, melt the butter in the oven. In a medium bowl, stir together flour, white sugar, and milk until smooth. Pour batter into the prepared dish. In a separate bowl, toss pineapple with brown sugar until fruit is well coated. Drop pineapple mixture by spoonfuls into the batter. Sprinkle with cherries. Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden.
