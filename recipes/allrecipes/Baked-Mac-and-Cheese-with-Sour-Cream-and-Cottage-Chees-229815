Reserve 1/2 cup shredded mild Cheddar cheese for later use Mix mild Cheddar cheese, sharp Cheddar cheese, sour cream, cottage cheese, and egg together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Stir cooked macaroni into cheese mixture. Pour macaroni mixture evenly into the prepared baking dish; sprinkle with the reserved 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese.
