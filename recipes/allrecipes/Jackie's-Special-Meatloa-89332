Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking pan. Place the ground beef, eggs, panko, and 1/2 cup ketchup in a large bowl. Mix by hand, and season with salt-free seasoning blend, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Form into a loaf shape, and place on the prepared baking pan. Drizzle with remaining 1/4 cup ketchup. Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
