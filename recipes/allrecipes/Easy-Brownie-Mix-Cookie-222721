Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. Combine brownie mix, flour, oil, water, eggs, and chocolate chips in a large bowl. Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until cookies are just set, about 9 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets for 2 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
