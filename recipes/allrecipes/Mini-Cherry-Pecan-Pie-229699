Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine crust ingredients in a large bowl. Beat at medium-high speed until mixture is creamy (1-2 minutes). Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. Form 1-inch balls of dough and place in mini muffin tins. Using your fingers dusted with flour, press dough into bottom and sides of tins. Fill each mini pie with about 1 tbsp. of LUCKY LEAF Cherry Pie Filling. Bake uncovered for 18 to 20 minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool completely before serving. Top each mini pie with a pecan half just before serving.
