Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Sift together the flour, baking soda, salt and cocoa, set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg, then stir in the vanilla and milk. Gradually stir in the dry ingredients until well blended. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheet. Bake for 8 minutes in the preheated oven. Cut the large marshmallows into halves. When the cookies come out of the oven, press one piece of marshmallow into the top of each one. Return the cookies to the hot oven for an additional 2 minutes. Cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely. In a medium bowl, combine the confectioners' sugar, cocoa and salt. Beat in the softened margarine and heavy cream until icing is smooth. Frost cooled cookies.
