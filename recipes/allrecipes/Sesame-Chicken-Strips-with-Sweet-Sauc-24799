Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). In a shallow plate or bowl combine 1 cup mayonnaise, onion and mustard. Mix together and set aside. In a separate shallow plate or bowl combine the cracker crumbs and sesame seeds. Cut chicken lengthwise into 1/4 inch strips. Dip chicken strips in mayonnaise mixture, then in sesame mixture to coat. Place coated strips in a single layer on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 18 minutes, or until juices run clear. Mix 1 cup mayonnaise and honey together in a small bowl and serve with chicken strips.
