Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Stir in the milk and cream; set aside. Combine the sugar and flour in a separate bowl. Pour the sugar mixture into the egg mixture, then stir until well combined. Fold in the rhubarb. Pour into a casserole dish, and sprinkle with cinnamon. Bake in a preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 to 60 minutes.
