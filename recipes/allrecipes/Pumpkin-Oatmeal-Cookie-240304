Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Beat white sugar, shortening, and brown sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Stir pumpkin and eggs into creamed butter mixture; add flour, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, and cloves and mix until dough is just combined. Fold oats into dough. Drop dough by spoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are crisp, about 12 minutes.
