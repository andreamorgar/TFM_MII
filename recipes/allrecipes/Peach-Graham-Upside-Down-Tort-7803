Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place 1 tablespoon of the butter or margarine in a 9 inch round cake pan and place in oven to melt. Once the butter or margarine has melted remove the pan from the oven and stir the brown sugar into the melted butter or margarine. Spread to coat the bottom of the pan evenly. Arrange the peach slices in the pan and set aside. Separate the eggs. In a small bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Set aside. Cream the remaining 8 tablespoons of the butter or margarine with the white sugar. Beat in the egg yolks, then the milk and the vanilla extract. Stir the graham cracker crumbs, baking powder, and salt together. Beat the graham cracker mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the batter. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, over the top of the peaches. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 40 minutes. Remove cake from oven and immediately invert the cake upside down onto a large plate. Because this cake is so moist, it should be stored in the refrigerator. Makes about 8 servings.
