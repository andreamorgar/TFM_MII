Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine olives, green onions, Cheddar cheese, curry powder, mayonnaise, and salt. Mix well. Spread mixture on English muffins. Cut the English muffins into fourths. Note: If you want to freeze these, now is the time! Arrange the muffin pieces on a cookie sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 10 minutes.
