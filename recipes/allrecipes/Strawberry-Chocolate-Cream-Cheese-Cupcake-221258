Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners. Stir chocolate cake mix, sour cream, vegetable oil, water, and eggs together in a large bowl. Pour cake batter evenly into prepared muffin cups. Place a small spoonful of whipped cream cheese in each muffin cup. Stir strawberry preserves in a bowl until smooth; spoon about 1/4 teaspoon per cupcake over cream cheese. Gently press strawberry preserves and cream cheese into the cake batter with a spoon. Bake in preheated oven until cupcake tops spring back when lightly touched, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. Spread cream cheese frosting over completely cooled cupcakes and garnish with strawberry slices.
