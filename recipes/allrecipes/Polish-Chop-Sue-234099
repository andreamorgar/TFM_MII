Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook kluski noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes; drain. Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook sausages in the skillet until browned, about 5 minutes; cut into bite-size pieces. Stir mushroom soup, onion soup mix, and water together in a large baking dish; add kluski noodles, sausage, and sauerkraut. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour to 90 minutes.
