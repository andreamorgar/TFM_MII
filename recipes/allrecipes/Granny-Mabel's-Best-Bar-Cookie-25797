Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan. In a large bowl, stir together 2 cups flour, oats, brown sugar, salt and baking soda. Mix in melted butter until evenly distributed. Press half of the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly toasted. Remove from the oven and immediately sprinkle with chocolate chips. Let stand. In a small bowl, mix the caramel topping with the remaining flour; drizzle evenly over the chocolate chips. Sprinkle the remaining crust mixture evenly over the caramel layer and press down lightly. Bake for 15 more minutes in the preheated oven. Allow to cool completely before cutting into squares.
