Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the bananas into a small glass baking dish. Stir together the brown sugar, juice, and sherry; pour over the bananas, then sprinkle with nutmeg. Melt the butter in a small pan over medium heat. Stir in chopped nuts, and cook until lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Pour over the banana mixture. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes until the bananas are tender, and have become lightly glazed.
