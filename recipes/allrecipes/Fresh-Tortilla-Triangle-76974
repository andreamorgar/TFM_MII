Heat oil in a 10-inch skillet to 370 degrees. Drop triangles in hot oil, 8 at a time. Fry, turning chips once or twice, until they stop sizzling and turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove with tongs or a slotted spoon and drain on a wire rack set over a shallow pan. Sprinkle with salt immediately.
