Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels until cooled. Cut bacon into small pieces. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Combine bacon pieces, raisins, olives, ham, and cloves in a bowl. Roll dough onto a work surface and spread bacon mixture evenly over the top. Roll dough around the bacon filling, ensuring the edges match up to form a loaf-shape again. Place dough, seam-side down, onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Cool bread for 10 minutes; slice into 1/2-inch pieces. Place apricot preserves in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave, stirring at 30 second intervals, until melted and smooth, about 1 minute. Serve preserves on the side or drizzle over bread.
