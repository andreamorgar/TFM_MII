Combine cubed halibut, lime juice, lemon juice, tequila, minced jalapeno peppers, and 1 diced mango in a non-metallic bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 1 1/2 hours. After the ceviche has sat for 1 1/2 hours, add the green pepper, sweet onion, and red onion. Mix well, then recover and refrigerate another 30 minutes. Fold in the remaining diced mango, cilantro, and parsley; season to taste with salt before serving.
