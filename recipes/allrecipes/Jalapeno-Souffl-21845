Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8 inch baking dish. Whip the eggs in a small bowl and pour into the baking dish. Layer with jalapenos. Top jalapenos with the cheese. Top cheese with more jalapenos. Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and lightly brown.
