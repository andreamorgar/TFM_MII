Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cook ground beef and sausage in a large, deep skillet until well browned, about 5 minutes. Drain fat. Stir in pasta sauce. Bring to a simmer. While sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Stir in the egg noodles. Boil until cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well. Spoon half of the meat sauce into the prepared baking dish. Top with half of the cooked noodles, and 1 1/2 packages of cheese slices. Repeat with remaining sauce, noodles, and cheese. Place uncovered dish in preheated oven. Bake, until cheese is melted and browned, about 40 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
