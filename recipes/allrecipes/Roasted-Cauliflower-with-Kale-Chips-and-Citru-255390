Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread kale on the baking sheet. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil on top. Coat with Parmesan cheese, red chile pepper, oregano, and salt. Bake in the preheated oven until crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Heat butter in a small skillet until melted and starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in bread crumbs. Remove from heat. Slice cauliflower into 1/2-inch "steaks". Rub 1 tablespoon olive oil and chipotle spice rub on top. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add cauliflower; cook and stir until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to the baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until just tender, about 15 minutes. Place cauliflower steaks on a large serving platter; top with crisp kale and orange. Whisk remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and vinegar together in a small bowl. Drizzle over orange. Sprinkle bread crumbs on top.
