Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dissolve the ammonia in the milk, and set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the lard and sugar until smooth. Mix in the lemon oil, eggs, and salt. Stir in the milk alternately with the flour to form a soft but manageable dough. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls. Place 2 inches apart onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Flatten the cookies using the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.
