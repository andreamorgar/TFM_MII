Combine water, quinoa, cinnamon stick, and nutmeg in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until water is absorbed and quinoa is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and discard cinnamon stick. Mix apple, honey, and chia seeds into the quinoa. Let sit until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.
