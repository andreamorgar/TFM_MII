Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch tube pan. In a medium bowl, mix brown sugar, almonds, and flour. Stir in butter and 1 teaspoon orange zest, and set aside. In a separate medium bowl, thoroughly beat together butter and sugar with an electric mixer. Mix in eggs one at a time. Beat in remaining teaspoon orange zest and vanilla extract. In a large bowl, mix flour, baking powder, and baking soda. With an electric mixer set to Low, alternately mix in egg mixture and 2/3 cups orange juice to make a batter. Spoon 1/2 the batter into the prepared 9 inch tube pan. Top with 1/2 the brown sugar mixture. Cover with remaining batter, and top with remaining brown sugar mixture. Bake 25 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Turn out onto a wire rack to cool. Mix 5 teaspoons orange juice and confectioner's sugar in a small bowl, and use to glaze the cooled cake.
