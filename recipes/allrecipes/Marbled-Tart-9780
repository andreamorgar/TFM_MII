Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Combine flour, 1/3 cup sugar, cocoa and salt. Cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 Tbsp at a time, mixing gently until all the mixture is moistened. Form this mixture into a ball. Shape dough into twenty-four 1-inch balls and press onto the bottom and up the sides of ungreased 1 3/4-inch muffin cups. In a small bowl beat cream cheese and 3 tablespoons sugar until fluffy. Separate the egg and beat in the egg yolk, sour cream and vanilla. Divide the cream cheese mixture evenly among the muffin cups. Top each with about 1/2 tsp of the chocolate chips. Bake for 5 minutes. Remove from oven. With a knife or chopstick, slightly swirl chocolate into mixture just to marble. Return to the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes more. Cool slightly in pan. Remove and cool on a rack.
