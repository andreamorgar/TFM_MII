In a saucepan, brew tea bags in hot water for 15 minutes. While waiting for tea to brew, squeeze the lemon slices as you put them into a large pitcher. Pour in sugar. Pour brewed tea into the pitcher with the sugar and lemons. You can let this sit in refrigerator for up to 1 day, or use it right away. When ready to serve, stir in almond extract, vanilla extract and lemon lime soda.
