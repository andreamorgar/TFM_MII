Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Whisk eggs and milk together in a large bowl. Heat olive oil in a large oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Pour 1/2 the egg mixture into the hot oil; arrange salami over egg mixture and sprinkle with parsley. Add 2/3 the Parmesan cheese, 2/3 Romano cheese, and 2/3 the mozzarella cheese over the salami-parsley layer; season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Cook egg-cheese mixture until edges of frittata are browned and middle is set, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour the remaining egg mixture over frittata; sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese, Romano cheese, and mozzarella cheese; season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Bake in the preheated oven until frittata has risen to about 3 inches and middle is set, 20 to 25 minutes. Carefully turn frittata onto a cutting board; cut into 2-inch squares using a sharp knife. Arrange squares in a bowl and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.
