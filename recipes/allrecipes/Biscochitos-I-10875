Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix together shortening, margarine and sugar with a mixture until well blended. Mix in the rest of the ingredients until smooth. Roll out on a floured board to 1/2 or 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into desired shapes and place on baking sheets. Bake until golden brown, about 10 - 12 minutes. Garnish as desired or leave plain.
