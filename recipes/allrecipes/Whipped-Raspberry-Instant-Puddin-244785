Mash raspberries in a bowl using the back of a spoon until a jelly-like layer forms on top. Freeze for 5 minutes. Mix sugar into mashed raspberries, spooning the bottom layer of raspberries over the top and you stir. Repeat 5 or 6 times until fully incorporated; freeze for 15 minutes. Serve chilled.
