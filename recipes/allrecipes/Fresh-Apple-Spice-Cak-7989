Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour one 10 inch tube pan. Place apples, water and 2 tablespoons of the sugar in a saucepan. Cook, covered, over medium heat until tender. Approximately 5 to 10 minutes. Remove apple mixture from heat and set aside. In a large bowl cream the butter with the remaining 2-1/2 cups white sugar. Beat in the eggs, then the apple mixture (including the liquid). Stir the all-purpose flour, wheat flour, baking soda, salt, ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg and ground cloves together. Beat the flour mixture into the apple mixture until just thoroughly moistened. Stir in the raisins. Turn the batter into the prepared pan. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 1 hour and 30 minutes or until cake tests done. Let cake cool and rack. Makes about 20 to 24 servings.
