Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Mix brown sugar, water, and 2 teaspoons butter together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until syrup has thickened, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Beat 2 teaspoons butter in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Gradually add white sugar until incorporated; beat in egg. Gradually beat flour mixture into butter mixture, alternating with milk, until batter is smooth; stir in vanilla extract. Transfer batter to prepared loaf pan; pour in the syrup on top of the batter. Bake in the preheated oven until cake is set and syrup has soaked to the bottom, 30 to 40 minutes.
