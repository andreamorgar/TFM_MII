Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir cereal, sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl; stir in melted butter until mixture is thoroughly moistened. Press mixture onto bottom and up sides of a 9-inch pie plate using a small, dry measuring cup. Bake in preheated oven until crust is browned and crisp, about 17 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool 15 minutes. Whisk whole eggs, yolks, lemon juice, butter, and sugar together in a heat-proof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Whisk until egg mixture is as thick as honey, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Let cool 30 minutes. Beat heavy cream in a bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until stiff peaks form; gently fold into lemon mixture. Spoon into pie crust and chill 1 hour. Sprinkle with lemon zest.
