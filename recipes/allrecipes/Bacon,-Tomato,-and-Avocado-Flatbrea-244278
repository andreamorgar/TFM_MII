Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a large cast iron skillet with cooking spray. Place prepared skillet over medium heat for 30 seconds. Add 1 flour tortilla and cook until bottom is browned and hardened, about 1 minute. Top tortilla with 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese, 1/2 of the tomato, 1/2 of the onion, and 1/2 of the bacon; season with salt and pepper. Cook until cheese starts to melt, about 1 minute. Transfer skillet to preheated oven and cook until cheese is completely melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Top tortilla with 1/2 of the avocado slices, cilantro, salt, and pepper. Drizzle ranch dressing and buffalo ranch dressing in a zig-zag motion over the top. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
