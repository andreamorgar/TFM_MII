Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and grease cookie sheets. In separate bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside. In a large bowl, cream together shortening and both sugars until light and fluffy, using electric mixer at medium speed. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Blend in vanilla. Gradually add dry ingredients to creamed mixture, mixing well with spoon. Stir in oats, dates and walnuts. Drop dough by teaspoonfuls, about 2 inches apart, on cookie sheet. Bake for 8 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on racks.
