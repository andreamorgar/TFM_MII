Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly butter 2 muffin tins. Mix flour and baking powder together in a large bowl; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir buttermilk and bacon into flour mixture just until dough holds together. Turn dough onto a floured surface and roll into an even thickness. Fold dough over itself a few times. Cut dough into circles using a cookie or biscuit cutter and arrange circles in the prepared muffin tins. Bake in the preheated oven on the top rack until biscuits are lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
