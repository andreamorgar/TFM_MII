Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix the ground beef, sausage, onion, carrots, onion soup mix, brown sugar, eggs, and barbeque sauce together in a large mixing bowl until thoroughly combined. Stir in enough oats to make the mixture hold together -- you can use up to 2 cups of oats. Divide the mixture in half, and spoon into 2 9x5-inch loaf pans. Place 3 strips of bacon the long way onto each loaf. Bake in the preheated oven until the meatloaf is no longer pink in the middle and the juices run clear, about 1 hour.
