Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 9x5-inch loaf pans. In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. In a separate large bowl, beat the butter, vegetable shortening, white sugar, and brown sugar together with an electric mixer on Low until thoroughly mixed; beat in the bananas, eggs, buttermilk, sour cream, and vanilla extract until well combined. Mix half of the flour mixture into the banana mixture; beat until combined; beat in remaining flour mixture. Mix on Medium speed for 1 minute. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaves comes out clean, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Allow to cool for 15 minutes; serve warm.
