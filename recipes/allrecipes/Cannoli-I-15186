Carefully remove cookies and roll on the cooking cylinders while they are hot. Allow them to cool and remove from the cylinder. Fill when all of the shells have been baked and cooled. In a medium bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Fold in the chocolate chips and cherries (if desired). Use a pastry bag to pipe the filling into the shells.
