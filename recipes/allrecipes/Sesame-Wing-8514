Combine honey, mustard , lemon juice, curry powder, garlic, and pepper in a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken wings, and marinate at least 1 hour in refrigerator. Meanwhile, toast sesame seeds by placing on a cookie sheet in a 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, shaking to toss occasionally. Remove wings from marinade. Broil for 5 to 10 minutes on each side, or until well cooked. Baste with marinade every few minutes. Remove from oven, and sprinkle liberally with the sesame seeds.
