Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x14 inch baking dish. Fill a large pot with lightly-salted water and bring to a boil; stir in the egg noodles and return to a boil. Stirring occasionally, boil uncovered until the pasta is cooked yet still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Place a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir the ground beef in the skillet until completely browned. Add the onion and garlic; continue cooking and stirring until the onion is translucent. Pour all of the tomato sauce, water, and red wine into the mixture. Season with cumin, oregano, and cayenne pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer. Mix the cooked pasta into the sauce; transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the Cheddar cheese over the top of the pasta and sauce. Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the sauce has absorbed into the dish, about 20 minutes.
