Cut off and discard tough lower third of broccoli stems, then peel remaining stem and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Cut remaining broccoli into 2-inch-wide florets. Bring water to a boil in a 4-quart heavy pot, then add broccoli and 1 teaspoon salt and boil, uncovered, until broccoli is just tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking, reserving cooking water in pot, then drain broccoli. Wrap parsley, thyme, and bay leaf in a small square of cheesecloth and tie into a bundle to make a bouquet garni. Add to reserved cooking water along with parsnips, onion, and chicken broth and simmer, covered, until parsnips are very tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Discard bouquet garni and reserve 1 cup cooking liquid, then puree remaining soup with broccoli, in batches if necessary, in a blender until smooth (use caution when blending hot liquids). Transfer pureed soup to another pot and thin to desired consistency with reserved cooking liquid. Stir in pepper, nutmeg, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste) and bring to a simmer over moderate heat, stirring occasionally.
