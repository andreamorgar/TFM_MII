Preheat oven to 375 degrees F ( 190 degrees C). Roll out the pastry for the shell, and fit into a 10 inch pan. Sprinkle the raisins over the bottom of the crust. Combine the egg yolks, egg, sour cream, syrup, sugar, nutmeg, vanilla, and flour in a bowl. Mix just until blended, not too much. Pour filling into the shell. Sprinkle a little more nutmeg on top. Bake 30 to 35 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool, and then chill the pie.
