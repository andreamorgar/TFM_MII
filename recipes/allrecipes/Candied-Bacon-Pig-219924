Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Wrap each little sausage with 1/3 slice of bacon, and secure them with toothpicks. Place the appetizers on a large baking sheet and sprinkle with 3/4 cup of brown sugar. Bake in the preheated oven until the sugar is melted and bubbling, about 40 minutes; turn the appetizers after 20 minutes. Remove the appetizers from the baking sheet with a slotted spoon, and place into a slow cooker. Sprinkle the remaining 3/4 cup of brown sugar and the five-spice powder over the smokies, and drizzle with the cola. If desired, add hot sauce to taste. Set the cooker to High, and cook 4 hours. Serve warm.
