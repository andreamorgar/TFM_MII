Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two baking sheets. Cream the sugar and shortening together in a large mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Stir in the flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg, blending thoroughly. Mix in the persimmon pulp, raisin paste, and walnuts. Drop by spoonfuls onto prepared cookies sheets, and spread out slightly. Bake in preheated oven until cookie top springs back when touched, 12 to 15 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
