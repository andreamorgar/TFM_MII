Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons rum. Mix the milk into cooled cocoa mixture, then beat into the batter alternately with the flour mixture. Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
