Chop the shrimp into smaller pieces and transfer to a bowl. Stir in the avocado and cilantro. In a separate bowl, stir together the orange soda and ketchup until the foaming stops. Pour over the shrimp mixture and toss to coat. It should be soupy. Refrigerate for about 30 minutes to blend the flavors before serving with saltine crackers.
