Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl until creamy. Add egg and vanilla extract; mix well. Whisk flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, nutmeg, and cloves together in another bowl. Beat flour mixture into butter mixture until dough is just-combined. Stir vanilla chips into dough. Drop dough by the 1/8-cup full 2-inches apart on a baking sheet. Bake cookies in the preheated oven until golden and soft, 10 to 11 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
