Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter and flour a 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)). Mix cake mix, sour cream, pudding mix, vegetable oil, coffee, and eggs together in a bowl; fold in chocolate chunks. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until cake springs back when lightly touched, 65 to 75 minutes. Cool in pan on a wire rack. Slice cake and microwave each piece for 10 seconds to serve.
