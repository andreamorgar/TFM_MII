Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). In a large mixer bowl, beat butter and sugar until creamy. Add eggs and vanilla extract; beat until light and fluffy. In a separate bowl, stir together flour, baking soda and salt; gradually blend into butter mixture. Stir in vanilla chips, and macadamia nuts. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake for 9 minutes. (Do not overbake; cookies will be soft. They will puff while baking; flatten upon cooling.) Cool slightly, remove from cookie sheet to wire rack. Cool completely.
