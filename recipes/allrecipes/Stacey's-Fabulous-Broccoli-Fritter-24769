In a large bowl combine broccoli, garlic, onion and eggs; mix well. Stir in Parmesan and cornmeal; mix well. Form into patties. If mixture is too dry, add another egg; if too wet, add more cornmeal. Season with pepper to taste. Heat 1 inch of oil in a large, deep skillet. Place patties in hot oil; cook, turning once, until well browned on each side.
