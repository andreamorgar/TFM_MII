Rinse and hull strawberries. Distribute evenly in a 10 inch pie pan. In a medium saucepan combine pudding mix, gelatin mix, and water. Stir well and bring to a full boil. Pour mixture over strawberries and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours. Top with light frozen whipped topping prior to serving, if desired.
