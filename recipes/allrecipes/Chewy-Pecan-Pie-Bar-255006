Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour melted butter into a 9x13-inch baking pan. Beat brown sugar, eggs, flour, vanilla extract, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl until smooth; stir in pecans. Spread the sugar mixture over the butter in the baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until set and golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven; dust with confectioners' sugar. Cool until easily touched, about 10 minutes; cut into bars.
