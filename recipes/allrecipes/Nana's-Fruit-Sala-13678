In a large bowl combine fruit cocktail, mandarin oranges, apples, pears, and pecans. In a small mixing bowl, mix cream cheese and lemon juice. Add enough fruit cocktail juice to achieve a smooth and creamy consistency. Fold the cream cheese mixture into the fruit mixture and toss. Cover and chill for 1 hour before serving. Prior to serving slice bananas, add to fruit salad and toss again.
