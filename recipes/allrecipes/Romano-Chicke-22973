Place chicken breasts on a pan. Place Swiss cheese and ham slices on top and roll up, securing with toothpicks if necessary. In a small bowl combine the Parmesan cheese, paprika, garlic salt, tarragon, basil and bread crumbs. Mix together and dip rollups in mixture to coat. Drizzle with melted butter and cook on High in microwave for 4 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
