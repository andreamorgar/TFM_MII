Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the wing pieces, and fry until golden brown on all sides, about 6 to 10 minutes. Spoon off any excess fat, and add the orange marmalade, mustard, and soy sauce to the skillet, stirring to blend the ingredients and coat the wing pieces. Simmer on medium heat 8 to 10 minutes, until the sauce thickens and glazes the wings. Serve hot.
