Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Mix oats, almonds, coconut, chia seeds, flax seeds, and hemp hearts together in a bowl. Mix honey, orange juice, and vanilla extract together in a separate large bowl. Add oat mixture to honey mixture; stir well until evenly coated. Spread granola onto ungreased baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 50 minutes. Mix chocolate chips into granola; cool to room temperature.
