Place sliced apples in a large bowl and toss with sugar and lemon juice. Melt butter or margarine in a large skillet over medium heat. Add apples to skillet and saute until tender. Allow to cool. In a medium mixing bowl, beat cream cheese until fluffy. Gradually beat in 1 cup milk, pudding mix, and lemon rind. Add remaining 1/2 cup milk, and beat until smooth. Spread mixture into pastry shell. Arrange apples over cream cheese layer. In a small saucepan, heat preserves until runny. Using a pastry brush, lightly coat apples. Refrigerate pie for at least 1 hour before serving.
