Lightly grease 2 microwave-safe ramekins. Stir almond flour, flax meal, egg, coconut oil, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Divide almond mixture between ramekins. Heat ramekins in the microwave for 30 seconds; let rest 5 seconds. Heat ramekins for an additional 30 seconds until muffins are risen and cooked. Remove from microwave and flip upside-down onto a plate to cool.
