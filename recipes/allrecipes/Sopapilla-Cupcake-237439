Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 18 muffin cups with paper liners. Mix cake mix, water, egg whites, oil, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, vanilla extract, and lemon extract together in the bowl of a stand mixer; mix on low for 30 seconds. Increase speed to medium and mix batter for 2 minutes. Fill muffin cups 2/3-full with batter. Combine white sugar and 1 tablespoon cinnamon together in a small bowl; sprinkle over batter. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in a cupcake comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Cool cupcakes to room temperature. Beat butter in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add confectioners' sugar, 3 tablespoons honey, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon; beat until just combined. Mix milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, into creamed butter mixture until desired consistency of frosting is reached. Spoon frosting into a piping bag or a plastic bag with a snipped corner; pipe onto each cupcake. Drizzle honey over each frosted cupcake.
