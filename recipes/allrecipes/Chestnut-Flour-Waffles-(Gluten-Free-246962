Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Mix chestnut flour, white rice flour, potato starch, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Combine milk, egg yolk, vegetable oil, and honey in another bowl. Sift in flour mixture, whisking constantly to prevent lumps in the batter. Beat egg white in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until peaks form. Fold gently into batter until just combined. Pour batter onto preheated waffle iron and cook until golden brown per manufacturer's instructions, 3 to 5 minutes.
