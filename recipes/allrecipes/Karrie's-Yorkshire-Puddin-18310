Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spread shortening into a 9x13 inch baking pan and place on center rack in oven. In a medium bowl, mix flour and 1 cup milk until a smooth paste is formed. Whisk in eggs one at a time, mixing thoroughly after each addition. Whisk in remaining 1 cup milk. As soon as shortening in oven has begun to smoke, remove pan from oven and pour in batter. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, until golden brown and fluffy. Remove and allow to sit 5 minutes. Slice and serve immediately.
