Preheat a griddle to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) or place a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Stir ricotta cheese, milk, and egg yolks together in a bowl until combined. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl; stir in ricotta mixture. Whisk egg whites in a bowl until frothy; fold into ricotta mixture. Oil preheated griddle with about 1 teaspoon canola oil; pour 1/4 cup batter onto hot griddle for each pancake. Cook until evenly golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes; turn and cook until evenly golden on other side, 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter, oiling griddle between batches.
