Melt butter/margarine in a medium skillet over low heat. Add chicken, onion and green bell pepper and saute all over low heat for 4 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally and turning chicken pieces. Season with paprika, garlic salt and seasoned salt to taste. Cover skillet and let cook until chicken is done and juices run clear, about 15 minutes. When chicken is cooked through add soup and water and let simmer, stirring. When liquid has reached the consistency of a sauce, the dish is done.
