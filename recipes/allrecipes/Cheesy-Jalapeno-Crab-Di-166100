Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir together the crabmeat, Monterey Jack cheese, mayonnaise, garlic, jalapeno peppers, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, and salt in a bowl. Scrape into an 8x8 inch, glass baking dish, and smooth the top with a spatula. Sprinkle evenly with croutons and Parmesan cheese. Dust with the paprika. Bake in the preheated oven until the dip is bubbly and the top is golden brown, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to stand 5 minutes before serving.
