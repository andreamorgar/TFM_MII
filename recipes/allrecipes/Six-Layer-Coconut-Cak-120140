In another large mixing bowl and with clean beaters, beat egg whites on high speed until stiff peaks form; gently fold into batter. Pour into three greased and floured 9-in. round baking pans.

For frosting, in a large heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, egg whites, water, salt and cream of tartar over low heat or double boiler over simmering water.
