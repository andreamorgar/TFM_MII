Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. In a large bowl, stir together cake mix, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon and ginger. Make a well in the center and pour in pumpkin puree, oil, and eggs. Beat on low speed until blended. Scrape bowl, and beat 4 minutes on medium speed. Stir in chopped pecans. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
