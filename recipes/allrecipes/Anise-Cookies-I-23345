Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, cream together the shortening, sugar and eggs until smooth. Stir in the anise extract. Combine the flour and baking powder; stir into the wet ingredients. Scoop out spoonfuls and roll into balls. Place balls 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until light brown. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Frost when cool if desired.
