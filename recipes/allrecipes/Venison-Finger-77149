Heat the oil in skillet or deep fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a bowl, mix the flour, Parmesan cheese, and Italian seasoning. Dip venison strips in egg, then in the flour mixture to evenly coat. Fry coated venison strips in the hot oil until golden brown. Melt the brown sugar in a saucepan over medium heat, and mix in the mustard. Serve as a dipping sauce with venison strips.
