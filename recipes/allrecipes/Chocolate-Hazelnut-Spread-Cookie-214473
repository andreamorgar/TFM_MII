Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine the graham cracker crumbs, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl; add the egg, vanilla, and chocolate-hazelnut spread and mix by hand until well blended. Form the mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls and place on a baking sheet 2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven until crispy on the outside, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow to rest on cookie sheet a few minutes before moving to a wire rack to cool.
