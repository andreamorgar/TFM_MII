Place shredded potatoes and apple in a clean kitchen towel. Gather towel on top and wring out excess liquid. Combine potatoes, apple, eggs, flour, and green onion in a bowl. Heat vegetable oil in a large heavy sauce pan over medium-high heat. Form mixture into palm-sized patties; fry in hot oil, working in batches, until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes on each side. More oil may be needed with each batch. Remove pancakes from oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle with salt. Serve pancakes topped with sour cream.
