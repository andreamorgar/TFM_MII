Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a shallow bowl combine crushed crackers, garlic salt and pepper; mix well. In a separate bowl beat eggs. Dip your pork chops in the egg batter and then in the cracker mixture. Place the pork chops in a casserole dish. Place chunks of the butter around the pork chops. Cover and bake for 45 minutes.
