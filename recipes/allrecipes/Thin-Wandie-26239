Heat oil in deep-fryer or large heavy skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, vanilla and melted butter until well blended. Mix in the salt and baking powder. Gradually stir in flour with a wooden spoon until dough is stiff. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead in as much flour as necessary to make a smooth stiff dough. Dough should not be sticky. Roll the dough out paper thin and cut into 3 inch squares. Fry in the hot oil, turning once until golden. Drain in colander and place them into a waxed paper lined bushel basket. Dust with confectioners' sugar when cool.
