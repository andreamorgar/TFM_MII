Cook tortellini according to package directions. Rinse under cool water, and allow to cool slightly. In a large resealable plastic bag, combine bread crumbs, cornflake crumbs, salt, pepper, and parsley. Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep skillet over medium heat. In small batches, dip the tortellini in egg, and place in resealable bag. Shake to coat, and set aside on a plate until the oil is hot. In batches, deep fry breaded tortellini until golden brown. Serve with tomato sauce for dipping.
