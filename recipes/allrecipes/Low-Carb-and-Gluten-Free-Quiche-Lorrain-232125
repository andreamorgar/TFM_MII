Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix almond meal, butter, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon sea salt, and 1/8 teaspoon white pepper together, forming a ball. Gently press dough into a 9-inch pie pan. Bake crust in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. The crust will puff up slightly; gently press it back down with a spoon or fork. Continue baking until just lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Whisk half-and-half, eggs, 1/2 teaspoon sea salt, 1/4 teaspoon white pepper, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Sprinkle bacon into the bottom of the pie crust; top with Swiss cheese. Pour egg mixture over Swiss cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Let cool for 5 to 10 minutes to finish setting in the middle.
