Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine honey, peanut butter, dried fruit, rice flour, eggs, coconut oil, almonds, chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, flax seeds, cocoa powder, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl; mix until dough comes together. Roll dough into balls and place on a nonstick baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until centers are set and edges are golden, 8 to 10 minutes.
