Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9 inch cake pans. Beat the cake mix, eggs, and orange juice together in a mixing bowl on low speed until moistened. Increase speed to medium and beat in the pumpkin. Stir in the poppy seeds. Pour the batter into the prepared pans, dividing evenly. Bake in preheated oven until the top springs back when lightly touched, 28 to 31 minutes. Cool in pans for 10 minutes, then remove and place on wire racks to cool completely.
