Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Blend flour, sugar and salt. Cut in butter, lemon zest and orange zest until mixture resembles coarse meal. Blend sour cream in evenly. Gather dough into firm ball. Divide in half. Roll on well-floured surface to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut in 3 x 2 inch pieces; fold ends to center to resemble an envelope, overlapping slightly; seal with tiny piece of candied cherry. Place on ungreased baking sheet. Brush tops with water; sprinkle with sugar. Bake 6 to 8 minutes.
