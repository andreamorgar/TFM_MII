Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Mix the pasta with the chicken, cucumber, bell pepper, tomato, and garlic. Pour the tomato-vegetable juice cocktail and lemon juice over the salad; gently toss to coat. Season with black pepper and salt; serve warm or chilled.
