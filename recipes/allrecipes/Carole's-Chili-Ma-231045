Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water until cooked through but firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, green bell peppers, and garlic in the hot oil until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix tomatoes and their juices, tomato sauce, hot pepper sauce, chili powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, and black pepper into onion mixture; bring to a boil. Add kidney beans, black beans, and corn; reduce heat to low, cover skillet, and simmer chili for 30 minutes. Stir macaroni into chili, cover skillet, and simmer until macaroni is heated, 5 minutes; top with Cheddar cheese and green onions to serve.
