Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir eggs, mayonnaise, mustard, honey, horseradish, cayenne pepper, and hot pepper sauce together in a bowl; season with salt and black pepper. Place English muffins, cut-side up, on an ungreased baking sheet. Place 1 slice Canadian bacon on each muffin. Spoon 1/4 cup of egg mixture on top of bacon and sprinkle with pepper jack cheese. Top with green onions. Bake in preheated oven until cheese melts, 6 to 8 minutes.
