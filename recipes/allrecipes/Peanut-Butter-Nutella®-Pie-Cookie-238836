Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Beat cream cheese, peanut butter, chocolate-hazelnut spread, agave syrup, honey, egg, vanilla extract, baking soda, and sea salt together in a bowl until dough is combined. Drop dough by the tablespoonful onto prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 12 minutes. Cool on baking sheet for 3 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
