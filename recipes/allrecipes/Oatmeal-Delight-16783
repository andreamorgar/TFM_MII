Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla and milk. Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Using a wooden spoon stir in the oats, chocolate chips, and almonds. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheet. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
