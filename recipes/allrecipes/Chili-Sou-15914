In a large pot over medium heat, combine the ground beef and onions. Saute for 5 minutes, or until meat is browned. Drain excess fat and add the potatoes, beans, tomato soup, tomato juice, chili powder, water and salt to taste. Bring just to a boil and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 1 hour and serve.
