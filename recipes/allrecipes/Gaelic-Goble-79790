Pour the orange vodka, raspberry vodka, pineapple schnapps, grenadine, sour mix, pineapple juice, and cranberry juice into a cocktail shaker over ice. Cover, and shake until the outside of the shaker has frosted. Pour into a highball glass, and garnish with a maraschino cherry and orange slice to serve.
