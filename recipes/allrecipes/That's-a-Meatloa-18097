Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine the beef, eggs, tomato sauce, bread crumbs, cheese, garlic, parsley and oregano. Mix well and form into an 8x10 inch rectangle. Place the ham over the rectangle mixture, and then the cheese over the ham. Roll up jelly-roll style so that you end up with a rolled loaf about 5x8 inches. Place roll seam side down into a 5x9 inch loaf pan and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 75 minutes. Drain excess fat.
