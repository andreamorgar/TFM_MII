Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place whole sweet potatoes in a steamer over a couple of inches of boiling water, and cover. Cook until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain and cool. Peel, and slice sweet potatoes lengthwise into 1/2 inch slices. Place in a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt butter, brown sugar, water and salt. When the sauce is bubbly and sugar is dissolved, pour over potatoes. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, occasionally basting the sweet potatoes with the brown sugar sauce.
