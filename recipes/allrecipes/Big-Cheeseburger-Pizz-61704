Place the ground beef and onion in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring to crumble, until evenly browned. Season with seasoning salt, drain off grease, and set aside. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spread salad dressing on the pizza crust. Top with a layer of ground beef and onion. Sprinkle shredded cheese over the top. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until cheese is melted. Allow pizza to cool for about 5 minutes, then slice into wedges and top with lettuce tomato and pickles, if desired.
