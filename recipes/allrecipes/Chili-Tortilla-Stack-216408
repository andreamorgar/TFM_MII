Brown ground beef with garlic in large skillet until no longer pink; drain. Stir in 1/2 cup salsa, beans and green onions; cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Place 4 tortillas on foil-lined baking sheet. Spread half of bean mixture evenly over tortillas, spreading to edges, using about 1/3 cup bean mixture for each tortilla. Top with 3/4 cup cheese. Repeat layering with 4 more tortillas, remaining bean mixture and 3/4 cup cheese. Top with remaining 4 tortillas. Spoon remaining salsa evenly over tortillas, spreading to edges. Bake in preheated 350 degrees F oven 10 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake 5 minutes more or until heated through. Garnish with sour cream and cilantro, if desired.
