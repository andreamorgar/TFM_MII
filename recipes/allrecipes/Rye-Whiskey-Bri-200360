Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut slits about 1/4-inch deep in a crossing pattern across the top and along the sides of the Brie wheel. Place the brie in a baking dish. Bake the Brie in the preheated oven until softened, about 5 minutes. While the Brie bakes, stir the brown sugar, pecans, and whiskey in a small bowl; pour onto the top of the Brie and return to the oven another 10 minutes. Serve immediately.
