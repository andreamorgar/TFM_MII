Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large skillet over medium high heat, saute the beef and onion for 5 to 10 minutes, or until meat is browned and onion is tender; drain fat. Add the celery, chili, tomatoes, taco sauce and corn. Heat thoroughly, reduce heat to low and allow to simmer. Meanwhile, prepare the noodles according to package directions. When cooked, place them in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour the meat mixture over the noodles, stirring well. Top with the cheese. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 minutes, or until cheese is completely melted and bubbly.
