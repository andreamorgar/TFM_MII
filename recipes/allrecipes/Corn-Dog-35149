In a medium bowl, combine cornmeal, flour, salt, pepper, sugar and baking powder. Stir in eggs and milk. Preheat oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat. Insert wooden skewers into frankfurters. Roll frankfurters in batter until well coated. Fry 2 or 3 corn dogs at a time until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
