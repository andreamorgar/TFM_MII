In a large mixing bowl, cream butter, shortening and sugar. Beat in egg and vanilla. Combine flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Shape into two 12-in. rolls; wrap each in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. Unwrap and cut into 1-in. slices. Place 1 in. apart on greased baking sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Immediately make an indentation in the center of each cookie using the end of a wooden spoon handle. Remove to wire racks to cool. Combine filling ingredients in a mixing bowl; mix well. Place 2 teaspoonfuls in the center of each cookie. Let stand until set. In a small saucepan over low heat, melt chocolate chips and butter; stir until smooth. Drizzle over cookies. Store in the refrigerator.
