Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Combine shortening, butter, white sugar, brown sugar, egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Sift flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Beat slowly into the shortening mixture until thoroughly combined. Mix pistachios and coconut flakes into the dough using a large spoon or your hands until evenly distributed. Drop heaping spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto 2 baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are a light golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.
