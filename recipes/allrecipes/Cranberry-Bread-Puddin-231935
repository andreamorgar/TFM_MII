Whisk milk, cream, sugar, eggs, lemon zest, salt, cinnamon, and vanilla bean together in a bowl; fold in baguette slices, raisins, and cranberries. Set aside to soak for 40 minutes.

Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove foil and bake until until pudding is set and lightly browned, about 15 more minutes.
