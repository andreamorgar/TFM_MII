Stir water, quinoa, sage, and basil leaf together in a saucepan; bring water to a boil, cover saucepan with a lid, reduce heat to low, and cook until the water is absorbed and the quinoa is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove basil leaf from quinoa mixture and discard. Stir asparagus, goat cheese, and chia seeds into the quinoa mixture; replace lid on saucepan and let the mixture steam until the goat cheese melts and the asparagus softens slightly, about 5 minutes.
