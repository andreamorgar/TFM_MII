Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9x13 inch baking pans. In a small bowl, mix the milk, vegetable oil, Worcestershire sauce and hot pepper sauce. In a medium bowl, mix the cornmeal, flour, salt and baking soda. Stir in the milk mixture, and blend until a ball of dough has formed. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough for approximately 5 minutes. Divide into halves. Roll each half onto a baking sheet. Cut into small squares or triangles. Bake in the preheated oven 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Allow to cool slightly before removing from baking sheets.
