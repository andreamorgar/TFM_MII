Whisk eggs together in a bowl until mixture is evenly yellow; add kefir, flour, white sugar, brown sugar, salt, and baking soda and mix until batter is smooth. Coat a skillet with oil and place over high heat. Pour batter into the hot skillet, working in batches as needed, forming 3-inch pancakes; cook until batter starts bubbling and bottom is golden brown, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Flip and continue frying until pancake is golden brown, about 1 minute.
