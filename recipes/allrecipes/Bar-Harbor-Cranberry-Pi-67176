Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Butter a 9 inch glass pie plate. Spread cranberries over the bottom of the buttered pie plate. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of sugar and pecans over the berries. In a medium bowl, mix together the eggs and remaining sugar until well blended. Stir in flour, margarine and shortening, beating well after each addition. Pour over the cranberries. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until the filling is set, and the top is lightly browned.
