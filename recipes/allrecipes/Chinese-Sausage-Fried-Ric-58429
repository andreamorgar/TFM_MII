Bring the rice and 4 cups of water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Wash and soak the shittake mushrooms in 1 cup of hot water until softened, about 10 minutes. Slice the mushrooms and set aside, reserving liquid. Season the ground chicken with the soy sauce, sesame oil, and white pepper. Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant. Toss in the ground chicken, mushroom, and sausages. Cook and stir until the chicken is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Stir in the reserved mushroom liquid, dark soy sauce, green onions, and rice. Cook and stir until the rice is evenly coated with the sauce. Pour the eggs over the rice, stirring until the egg are no longer runny.
