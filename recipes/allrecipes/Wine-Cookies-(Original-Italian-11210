Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl combine the flour, baking powder and sugar. Add the wine and oil. Mix with a large fork and then with your hands. Roll small pieces of dough between hands to make "logs" then shape into circles. The circles should be no bigger than the 2 inches in diameter. Roll cookies in extra sugar and place on cookie sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 minutes or until slightly brown. After cookies cool they should be hard and crisp.
