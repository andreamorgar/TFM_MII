In a skillet, melt butter; add coconut and pecans. Cook and stir over medium heat for 10 minutes or until golden brown and toasted; set aside. In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and milk until smooth. Fold in whipped topping. Pour into crusts. Drizzle with caramel topping; sprinkle with coconut mixture. Cover and freeze for 8 hours or overnight or until firm. Remove from the freezer 5 minutes before slicing.
