Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Whisk milk, yogurt, butter, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Mix gluten-free flour, chocolate chips, oat flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir milk mixture into the flour mixture until well incorporated. Let batter stand, about 10 minutes. Pour 1/2 cup of batter onto the preheated iron and bake until crisp and golden, according to manufacturer's instructions, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Repeat with remaining batter.
