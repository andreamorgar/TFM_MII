In a large skillet over medium high heat, saute the ground beef for 5 to 10 minutes, or until browned. Transfer to a slow cooker. Then add the onion, green bell peppers, beans and tomatoes to the slow cooker. Season with chili powder to taste. Cook on high setting for 4 hours, or until all vegetables are tender.
