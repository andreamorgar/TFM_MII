Stir 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup sherry, mustard powder, thyme, garlic, and ginger together in a large, shallow bowl. Place pork roast into marinade and cover; refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight for best flavor, turning occasionally. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place marinated pork roast onto a rack set into a roasting pan; discard the used marinade. Insert a probe-type meat thermometer into thickest part of the roast. Roast pork loin until thermometer reads 170 degrees F (75 degrees C), 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Combine apricot preserves, 2 tablespoons sherry, and 1 teaspoon soy sauce in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir until preserves melt. Serve apricot sauce with sliced pork roast.
