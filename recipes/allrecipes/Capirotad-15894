Toast the French bread and break it into 2 inch pieces. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a lightly greased 8x8 inch baking dish, spread about half of bread pieces on the bottom of the dish; sprinkle with half of the raisins, nuts and cheese. Repeat with a second and final layer of bread, raisins, nuts and cheese. Put anise candies on top of mixture, if desired. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, cook and stir brown sugar, cinnamon and water until it forms a syrup; pour half of the syrup over bread. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes and remove from oven; pour remaining syrup over bread and bake for another 15 minutes. Serve warm or cold.
