Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch pie plate or cake pan with 1 tablespoon butter. Place remaining 2 tablespoons butter into pan and place in the oven until butter is melted. Place eggs, cream cheese, milk, honey, flour, salt and baking powder into a blender; puree until smooth. Remove the plate from the oven and immediately pour the batter into it. Bake in preheated oven until puffed and dark golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes. Serve warm with desired toppings.
