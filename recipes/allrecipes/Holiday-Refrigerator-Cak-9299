Heat marshmallows and cream over low heat, folding over and over until marshmallows are half melted. Remove from heat, and continue folding until mixture is smooth and fluffy. Cool. Add 3/4 cup graham cracker crumbs, fruit, nuts, orange rind and sherry to the marshmallows. Stir to combine. Sprinkle a buttered loaf pan with 1/4 cup graham cracker crumbs, then pour the marshmallow concoction over crumbs. Chill thoroughly. Slice, and serve plain or with whipped cream.
