Combine milk and cream in a saucepan over low heat. Slowly stir egg yolks, sugar, and green tea powder into milk mixture until green tea powder is dissolved, avoiding liquid coming to a boil, about 5 minutes. Strain mixture into a bowl and cool to room temperature, at least 30 minutes. Pour milk mixture into an ice cream maker and follow manufacturer's instructions for ice cream.
