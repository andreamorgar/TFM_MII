Combine the rice and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes or until rice is tender and water is absorbed. Meanwhile, heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat until hot. Fry Spam(TM) slices until browned. Remove from the skillet, and set aside. Pour the eggs into the skillet; cook and stir until scrambled and cooked through. Set aside. For each plate, place two scoops of rice, two scrambled eggs, and two slices of spam. Top with brown gravy.
