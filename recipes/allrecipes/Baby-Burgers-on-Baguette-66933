Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange baguette slices in a single layer on a cookie sheet. Place in the preheated oven, and bake until lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, and allow to cool. Season the ground beef with mesquite seasoning, and mix lightly. Form tablespoonfuls of dough into mini burger patties. Season the patties with a little salt and pepper. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties for 1 to 2 minutes per side, until browned and well done. Place baguette slices on a large serving tray, and top each one with a piece of romaine leaf. Then place a mini burger on each one, and top with tomato slices. Apply ketchup and mustard before serving, or allow your guests to dress their own burgers.
