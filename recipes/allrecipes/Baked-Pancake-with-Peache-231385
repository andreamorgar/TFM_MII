Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt butter in a cast-iron skillet in the preheating oven. Combine peach slices, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl; gently toss to coat the peaches well. Beat eggs, milk, flour, vanilla extract, salt, and nutmeg together in a bowl until batter well-combined but a little lumpy; pour into skillet. Top batter with the peach mixture. Bake in preheated oven until set in the middle, about 20 minutes.
