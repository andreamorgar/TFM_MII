Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan; remove from heat and stir in chocolate drink mix, sugar, and coffee granules. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hour or overnight. Pour chocolate mixture in a large punch bowl about 30 minutes before serving. Scoop vanilla and chocolate ice cream into the bowl, stirring until partially melted. Garnish with dollops of whipped topping and shaved milk chocolate.
