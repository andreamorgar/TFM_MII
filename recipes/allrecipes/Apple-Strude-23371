Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a bowl, combine apples, raisins, currants, cinnamon, sugar and bread crumbs. Stir well. Spread several sheets of pastry generously with melted butter and lay them on atop the other on a baking sheet. Spread the fruit mixture evenly over the top sheet, then roll the sheets up to form a log shape. Brush with melted butter again. Bake in preheated oven 30 minutes, until pastry is golden brown and fruit is tender.
