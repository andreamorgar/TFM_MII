Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Press pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish. Beat butter, eggs, lemon juice, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; beat in sugar until smooth. Fold coconut and pecans into butter mixture; pour into pie crust. Bake in the preheated oven until pie is set in the middle, 45 to 50 minutes.
