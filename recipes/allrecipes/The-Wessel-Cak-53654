Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir together the almond meal and white sugar; set aside. In a large clean glass or metal bowl, whip the egg whites to stiff peaks. Fold in the sugar and nuts. Pour into a 10-inch springform pan. Bake for 45 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool over a wire rack, and remove from pan. Microwave the chocolate in a small bowl, stirring every 30 seconds until melted and smooth. Stir together the instant coffee and hot water, then stir them into the melted chocolate; set aside to cool slightly. In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and confectioners' sugar until light and fluffy. Gradually blend the chocolate mixture into the creamed mixture until fluffy and spreadable. Spread over the cooled cake.
