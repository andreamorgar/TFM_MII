Preheat oven to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Fit bottom pastry into a 10 inch pie plate. In a large bowl, combine chicken, soup, and vegetables. Mix well and pour into crust. Cover with top pastry. Seal edges and cut steam vents in top. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, until crust is golden brown.
