Place the kidney beans, chili beans, black beans, and black-eyed peas in a large, heavy pot., and simmer over medium heat. Place the ground beef and sausage in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until crumbly and evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain, and stir into the bean mixture. Place the red and green bell peppers, yellow and red onions, and garlic on top of the bean and meat mixture. Cover and steam for at least 10 minutes. Stir in the jalapeno, chipotle, serrano, habanero, banana, cherry and Anaheim peppers, red and green Thai chilies, chili powder, cumin, red pepper flakes, and taco seasoning. Season to taste with cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Cover, and simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 3 hours.
