Pour the evaporated milk and dry pudding mix into a container with a lid, seal it, and shake for 45 seconds to combine. Let the pudding set for 5 minutes. In 2 large parfait glasses, alternate layers of chocolate pudding with layers of cherry pie filling. Top each glass with whipped topping, and sprinkle with cinnamon. Chill for 1 hour before serving.
