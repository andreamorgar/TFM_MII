Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake the pie crust in the preheated oven until puffed and golden-brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove to a wire rack and cool completely. Puree 1 cup of strawberries in a blender until smooth. Pour pureed strawberries into a saucepan. Stir in the water, sugar, and cornstarch. Bring to a boil over medium heat until thickened, stirring often. Remove from heat and stir in the orange liqueur. Set aside. Arrange the remaining 3 cups of strawberries decoratively in the prepared pie crust. Pour the glaze over the berries. Refrigerate until glaze is set, about 4 hours.
