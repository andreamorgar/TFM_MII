Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 2-quart baking dish with cooking spray. Spread potatoes into the prepared baking dish; sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Mix eggs, Italian cheese blend, onion, pico de gallo, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, Greek seasoning, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl; pour over potatoes. Bake casserole in the preheated oven until lightly browned and eggs are set, about 40 minutes.
