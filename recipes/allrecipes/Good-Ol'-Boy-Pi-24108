Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.) In a large bowl, combine peach preserves, sweet potato, evaporated milk, brown sugar, eggs, salt and spice. Beat until smooth. Pour into pie crust. Sprinkle the pecans around the edge of the filling. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes, or until filling is set and crust is golden brown.
