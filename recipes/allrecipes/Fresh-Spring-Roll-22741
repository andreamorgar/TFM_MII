In a medium bowl, mix the cabbage, shrimp, sweet and sour sauce, celery and carrots. Fill a small bowl with hot water. Dip rice wrappers one at a time into the water. Allow wrappers to soften, then remove from the water and drain. As wrappers are removed from the water, fill each with 2 tablespoons of the cabbage mixture. Roll the wrappers and chill covered until serving.
