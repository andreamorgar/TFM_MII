Place 2 paper towels on a microwave-safe plate; add bacon and top with another paper towel. Cook in microwave on high until some grease is absorbed, about 30 seconds. Transfer bacon to a deep skillet and cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until crisp, 5 to 10 minutes. Lower heat to medium; stir garlic into bacon and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add onion; cook and stir until onion is slightly translucent and still firm, about 5 minutes. Mix squash into onion-bacon mixture; cook and stir until squash is slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add artichoke hearts; cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add capers and rosemary; cover skillet and cook, stirring often, until squash is softened but firm to the bite, about 5 more minutes. Season with salt and white pepper.
