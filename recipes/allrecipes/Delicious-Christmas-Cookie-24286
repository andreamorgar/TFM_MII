Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium bowl combine graham cracker crumbs, flour and baking powder. In a separate, large bowl combine condensed milk and butter; beat until smooth. Stir in graham cracker mixture, mixing well. Stir in coconut and chocolates. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake in preheated oven for 7 to 9 minutes, or until lightly browned. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
