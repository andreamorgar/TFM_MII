Heat oil in a large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Oil should be at least one-inch deep. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Add water a little at a time until dough comes together into a ball and doesn't stick to your hands, about 5 minutes. Tear off plum-sized pieces of dough and flatten into 1/2-inch disks. Fry pieces of dough in the hot oil until brown on both sides, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels or napkins before serving.
