In a medium bowl, mix cream cheese, mayonnaise, onion juice and grated onion. Spread the mixture thinly on the white bread slices. Roll 1 baby dill pickle in each slice of bread. Place in a medium glass baking dish with the seam side down. Cover and chill in the refrigerator 8 hours, or overnight. To serve, slice each bread roll into 1 inch slices.
