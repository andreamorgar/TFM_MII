Pour chocolate syrup into chilled large glass. Gently stir in milk. Holding the carbonated water about 5 inches from the top of the glass, slowly pour into the glass until a thick foam comes to the top of the glass. Using a long swizzle stick, stir the mixture once quickly, make sure the foam does not bubble over the glass. Serve immediately.
