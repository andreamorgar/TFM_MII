Stir milk and margarine together in a saucepan; bring to a simmer over medium-low heat, about 5 minutes. Combine confectioners' sugar, chocolate chips, cocoa powder, vanilla extract, cayenne pepper, and ground cinnamon together in a bowl. Pour hot milk mixture over sugar mixture and stir until smooth; spread into a glass baking dish. Refrigerate fudge until firm, at least 30 minutes.
