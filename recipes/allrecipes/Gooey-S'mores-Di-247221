Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread chocolate chips in the bottom of a glass baking dish. Arrange marshmallows on top. Bake in the preheated oven until chocolate softens and marshmallows are golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Let dip cool, about 5 minutes. Serve graham crackers alongside the dip.
