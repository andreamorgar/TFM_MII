Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 13x9-inch baking dish. Stir rice flour, soy flour, tapioca starch, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, nutmeg, and ginger together in a bowl. Beat margarine in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat brown sugar into the margarine until incorporated and the mixture lightens in color. Add eggs one at a time, thoroughly beating each egg into the mixture before adding the next; add pumpkin and vanilla with the third egg. Gradually blend the dry mixture into the wet mixture until you have a batter; pour into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
