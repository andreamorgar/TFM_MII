Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place the potatoes in a 10x15 inch baking dish and arrange the pork chops over the potatoes. Prepare the onion soup mix according to package directions and pour this over the pork and potatoes. Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 30 to 40 minutes, or until potatoes are tender and the internal temperature of the pork reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
