Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk the oil, cumin, garlic powder, chili powder, sea salt, black pepper, and red pepper together in a small bowl; add the chickpeas and toss to coat. Spread into a single layer on a baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until nicely browned and slightly crispy, about 45 minutes.
