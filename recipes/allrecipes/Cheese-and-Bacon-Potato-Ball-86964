Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the potatoes into a pot with enough lightly salted water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until tender. Drain. While the potatoes are cooking, fry the bacon pieces in a skillet over medium-high heat until browned, but not totally crisp. Mash the potatoes with the butter, milk and cheese until fairly smooth. Use a potato masher or a whisk. Mix in the bacon. Form balls about the size of large ice cream scoops, and place them on a greased baking sheet. Scrape the top and sides with a fork to make textured lines over the balls. Sprinkle about 1 tablespoon of Parmesan cheese over the top of each one. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheese is golden brown.
