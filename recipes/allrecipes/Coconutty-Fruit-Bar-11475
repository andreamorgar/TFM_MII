Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan. In a medium bowl, mix together the flour and baking powder. Cut in the butter until coarse crumbs form. Stir in eggs and water. Spread dough into prepared pan. Spread preserves over the top. In a medium size bowl, combine the sugar, melted butter, coconut and vanilla. Sprinkle evenly over the top of the jam layer, gently pressing down into jam. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes or until coconut is lightly browned. Let cool completely before cutting into bars.
