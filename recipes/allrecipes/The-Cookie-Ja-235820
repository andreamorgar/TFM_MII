Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Whisk flour, brown sugar, chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, white sugar, baking soda and salt together in a bowl. Stir butter and egg into flour mixture until dough is just mixed; drop by the spoonful onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookie are lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
