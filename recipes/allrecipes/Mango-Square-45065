Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x9 inch baking pan with wax paper. In a medium saucepan over low heat, place the mango with enough water to cover. Cook 15 minutes, or until soft. Remove from heat, drain, and set aside. In a large bowl, mix 1 cup flour and 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar. Cut in butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press into the prepared baking pan to make a crust. Bake crust 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned. In a medium bowl, thoroughly blend mango, brown sugar, 1/3 cup flour, eggs, mixed nuts, baking powder, lemon extract, and salt. Transfer to the prepared crust. Cover, and bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven until filling is set. Cool slightly before dusting with remaining confectioners' sugar. Cut into squares to serve.
