Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook until the garlic has softened, and turns golden brown, about 5 minutes. Pour in the lemon juice and soy sauce, season with the black pepper and cayenne pepper. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, and continue simmering for 5 minutes. To use: Brush Ruben's Garlic Grill Sauce onto red meats, chicken, and fish before and during grilling. It also works well as a marinade.
