Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix together dry ingredients. In a separate bowl mix together bananas, egg whites, milk and vanilla. Beat all together. Bake in a 9 x 13 inch pan which has been sprayed with non-stick spray for about 35 minutes. Cool and cut into bars. You may sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar, if desired.
