Put coffee grounds in a large container. Slowly pour water over the grounds. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and steep at room temperature for 18 to 24 hours. Line a strainer with several layers of cheesecloth and place atop a pitcher; strain coffee through the cheesecloth into the pitcher. Discard the grounds. To get a clearer brew, strain coffee again through coffee filters. Store in refrigerator.
