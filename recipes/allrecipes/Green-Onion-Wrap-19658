Trim the green onion stalks so that only a small amount of green remains. Fold the corned beef slices in half to form triangles. Spread the slices with equal amounts of cream cheese. Place the green onions on the cream cheese. Roll the corned beef slices so that the green onion stalks stick out slightly. Serve chilled.
