Mix gingerbread mix, water and egg in large bowl until batter is smooth. Heat griddle or large skillet sprayed with cooking spray on medium heat. Pour batter onto griddle, using scant 1/4 cup batter for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on tops, then turn to brown other sides. Meanwhile, beat pudding mix and milk in microwaveable bowl with whisk 2 min. Microwave on HIGH 1-1/2 min. or until heated through, stirring after 1 min. Serve pancakes with warm lemon sauce.
