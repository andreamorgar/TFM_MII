In the microwave, or in the top of a double boiler, melt candy bars and 1/2 cup of butter, stirring occasionally until smooth. Stir in cereal until well blended. Press into a greased 11x7 inch pan. Melt chocolate chips and remaining 1/4 cup butter or margarine, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat, and spread over the top of bars. Refrigerate for 1 hour, or until firm; cut into squares.
