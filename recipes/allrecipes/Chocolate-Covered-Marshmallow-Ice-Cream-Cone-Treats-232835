Melt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, until smooth, 1 to 3 minutes. Stuff 1 marshmallow into each ice cream cone; dip each stuffed cone into the melted chocolate. Roll the dipped cones in sprinkles. Place each coated cone in the cup of a mini muffin tin. Carefully place in freezer until chocolate hardens, about 10 minutes.
