Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Rinse and thoroughly drain the quinoa. In a large bowl, stir together the maple syrup, olive oil, and cinnamon; mix in the quinoa and flax seed until the grains are thoroughly coated. Spread the mixture out as thinly as possible on the prepared baking sheet. Toast the granola in the preheated oven until lightly golden brown, about 15 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. Let cool completely before storing in an air-tight container.
