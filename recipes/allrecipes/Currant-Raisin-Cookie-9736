Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Cream butter and sugar until smooth. Add the milk and eggs, stirring well. Set aside 1/4 cup of the flour. Sift the rest with baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Sprinkle on the grated orange rind. Stir into the butter mixture until well blended. In a separate bowl, mix together the currants, raisins, dates and nuts. Toss together with 1/4 cup of flour. Fold into the batter. Drop onto cookie sheets and bake for 23 to 25 minutes, until slightly golden. Let cool on rack.
