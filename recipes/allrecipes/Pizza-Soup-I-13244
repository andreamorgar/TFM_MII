In a large saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Saute mushrooms and onion in oil for 2 to 3 minutes, or until tender. Mix in water, pizza sauce, pepperoni, tomatoes, sausage and Italian seasoning. Cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover, and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Before serving, stir in Parmesan cheese. Garnish with mozzarella cheese.
