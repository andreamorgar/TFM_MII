Butter a baking dish and set aside. In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine sugar, vinegar, butter, cream of tartar, and salt. Heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar is melted. Do not stir once mixture comes to a boil. Cook candy until mixture reaches 250 to 265 degrees F (121 to 129 degrees C) on a candy thermometer, or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a rigid ball. Remove from heat and pour into prepared dish. Pull taffy by stretching out into a rope with buttered hands, folding the candy over and repeating, until taffy is white and porous and becomes too stiff to pull. Cut into 1-inch pieces with buttered kitchen shears. Wrap taffy pieces in waxed paper and store in an airtight container.
