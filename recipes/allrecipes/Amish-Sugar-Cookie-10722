Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix together vegetable oil (yes, 1 1/2 cups of vegetable oil), sugar and eggs. Mix in the flour, baking soda, baking powder, buttermilk, salt and vanilla. Pour teaspoon-sized amounts of batter onto cookie sheets, leaving plenty of room in between. These cookies will puff up and get large. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes.
