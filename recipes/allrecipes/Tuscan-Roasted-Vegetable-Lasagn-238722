Season with salt and pepper. Set aside. Cut polenta into 1/4-inch (0.5 cm) slices. Set aside. Lightly grease 13 x 9-inch (33 x 23 cm) baking pan with oil. Spread 1-1/2 cups (375 mL) of the pasta sauce onto the bottom. Arrange a layer of polenta over sauce. Spread half of the roasted vegetable mixture over polenta. In a large bowl, mix together remaining sauce and veggie ground round. Spread half of the veggie sauce over vegetables. Spread ricotta mixture carefully over vegetables. Sprinkle with 1 cup (250 mL) of the mozzarella. Add another layer of polenta (you may have some left over). Add remaining roasted vegetables, then remaining pasta sauce.
