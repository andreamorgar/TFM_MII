Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Beat eggs in a mixing bowl until foamy. Add flour, white sugar, and brown sugar; beat into the eggs. Blend butter, milk, and vanilla extract into the egg mixture. Stir walnuts, coconut, and chocolate chips into the egg mixture; pour into the pie shell. Place pie onto a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until cooked through, about 1 hour.
