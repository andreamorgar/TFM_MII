Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a small bowl, dissolve baking soda in hot water. Stir in the dates and raisins; set aside. In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the date and raisin mixture. Combine the flour and cinnamon; mix into the batter until just blended. Finally stir in the walnuts. Drop dough by tablespoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheet. Cookies should be at least 1 inch apart. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly browned. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 2 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
