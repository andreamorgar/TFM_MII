Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir in cream cheese. Unroll crescent dough and separate into individual pieces; spoon 2 to 3 teaspoons sausage mixture onto each piece of dough. Roll dough around filling. Brush each crescent roll with egg white. Arrange crescent rolls on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until rolls are lightly browned, about 15 minutes.
