Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar. Beat in the egg and persimmon pulp. Combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves and salt; stir into the persimmon mixture. Fold in raisins and walnuts. Drop by teaspoonfuls 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are firm. Let cool on the cookie sheets for 1 minute before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
