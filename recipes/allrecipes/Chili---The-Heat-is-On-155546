Heat the oil in a large stock pot over medium heat. Crumble the beef and pork into the pot. Cook, stirring frequently, until no longer pink. Drain off the grease, leaving just a thin layer. Cook the onion, garlic, bell pepper, and serrano pepper in the remaining oil until the onions soften, about 5 minutes. Add the lime juice, chili powder, cayenne pepper, black pepper, salt, and 1 1/2 bottles of dark beer. Slowly add the last 1/2 bottle of beer while stirring. Stir in the tomatoes and tomato juice. Reduce heat to low. Simmer 1 hour.
