Season chicken breasts and thighs with adobo seasoning and pepper. Place the seasoned chicken and 1 cup water in a large saucepan over medium heat. Turning frequently, cook until water has been reduced. Mix in remaining water, onion, green bell pepper, and celery. Cover, reduce heat to low, and continue cooking about 20 minutes, until vegetables are tender and chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear. Stir orange marmalade into the saucepan, coating each piece of chicken. Cover, and continue cooking about 10 minutes.
