Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place broccoli in a medium saucepan with 1 cup boiling water. Return to a boil. Cook covered until firm but tender, about 5 minutes. In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt the Cheddar cheese. Mix in the broccoli. Allow the mixture to cool and thicken approximately 15 minutes. In a medium bowl, mix the bread crumbs, salt and pepper. Spread the mixture onto a large piece of wax paper. Form the broccoli cheese mixture into balls and roll in the bread crumb mixture until thoroughly coated. Deep fry the balls until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
