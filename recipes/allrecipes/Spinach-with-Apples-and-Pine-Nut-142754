Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or wok over low heat. Add the garlic, pine nuts, and apple; cook until the nuts and garlic are golden and the apple is just soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Increase the heat to medium, and add the spinach to the skillet. Stir and cook another 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
