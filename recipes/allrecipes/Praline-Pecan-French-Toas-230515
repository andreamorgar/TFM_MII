Mix half-and-half, eggs, vanilla, and 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar together in a large shallow bowl; add French bread. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place butter in a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Place casserole dish in the preheating oven to melt butter, about 5 minutes. Swirl butter over bottom of the dish. Spread brown sugar, maple syrup, and pecans over the melted butter. Arrange soaked bread atop pecan mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until French toast is cooked through, 30 to 35 minutes. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
