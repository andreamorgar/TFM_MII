Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Season the salami with salt and black pepper in a skillet; cook and stir over medium heat until hot, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the barbeque sauce, diced tomatoes with green chilies, onion, spinach, sage, and cinnamon; cook, stirring occasionally, until hot and the spinach has wilted, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low and allow to simmer while preparing the rolls. Roll out the crescent dough, pinching the perforations closed if necessary. Spoon the sausage mixture over the crescent roll dough, leaving a 1 1/2-inch strip along one edge uncovered by filling. Working from the unfilled edge, roll the crescent dough over the filling. Pinch the seam closed. Gently transfer the roll onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling, about 15 minutes. Serve in slices.
