Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Sift dry ingredients, set aside. Beat margarine, sugar, egg, and vanilla. Add the flour mixture. Refrigerate dough for one hour. Powder hands lightly with flour and make ball about the size of a small egg, by using 1 tablespoon dough. Mix cinnamon and nuts together and roll balls in the spice mixture. Place on greased cookie sheet, 2 inches apart. Bake 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from pan soon as they come from oven.
