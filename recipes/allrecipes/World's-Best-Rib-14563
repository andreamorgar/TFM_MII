Soak 2 cups hickory wood chips in water for an hour or so. Prepare the grill for indirect cooking, and position a drip pan under the grate. Drop a handful of soaked hickory over coals when ready to barbeque. Brush grate lightly with oil. Position ribs on grill directly above the drip pan. Cover with onions. Close the lid, and cook for 1/2 hour. After the first 1/2 hour, brush the ribs liberally with barbeque sauce every 15 to 20 minutes for an hour. Add more coals and/or hickory chips as needed. Carve the ribs, and serve.
