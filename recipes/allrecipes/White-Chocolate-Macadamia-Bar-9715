Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Put nuts on a cookie sheet and bake for about 7 minutes, or until toasted. Grease an 8-inch square baking pan. In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg and brown sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes with an electric mixer on medium speed. Melt the butter over low heat and add to egg mixture along with vanilla. Mix well. Sift the flour, baking soda and salt onto a piece of wax paper, and add to egg mixture beating slowly. Mix until just blended. Coarsely chop the white chocolate and fold into mixture. Stir in macadamia nuts. Pour batter into baking pan. Bake for 28 to 30 minutes, or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Place on wire rack and let cool.
