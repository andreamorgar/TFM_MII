To Make Filling: Cook together the dates, drained cooked apricots, white sugar and apricot juice. Cook for about three minutes, or until it resembles jam. To Make Crust: Mix together melted shortening (part butter), brown sugar, all-purpose flour, baking soda, quick cooking oats, and vanilla. Press half of the crust mixture on bottom of well greased 9 x 12 x 2 inch pan. Cover with filling. Top with rest of crumbs. Press down gently. Bake for 30 minutes at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
