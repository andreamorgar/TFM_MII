Place chocolate chips, cream, and vanilla extract into a small saucepan. Stir over medium-low heat until the chocolate chips have melted. Stir in the Cointreau and set aside. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add bananas, cut-side down, and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn bananas over, and continue cooking until golden brown on the other side, 3 to 4 minutes more. To serve, ladle some of the sauce onto the center of 6 plates. Place two banana halves onto each plate, and sprinkle with toasted almonds.
