Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf pans. Mix pumpkin pie filling, sweet potato pie filling, water, and oil together in a bowl; add flour, baking soda, and baking powder. Stir well. Pour mixture into the prepared loaf pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into each loaf comes out clean, about 1 hour.
