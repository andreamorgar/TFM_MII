Place ice cubes into a highball glass or hurricane glass. Gently pour in the dark rum, light rum, coconut rum, grenadine, orange juice, pineapple juice, lemon juice, and vermouth one after another in order to create a layered effect in the glass. Garnish with a maraschino cherry, lemon slice, and orange slice.
