Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Arrange potato nuggets in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Shake baking sheet and continue baking until potato nuggets are extra crispy, 20 to 24 minutes longer. Remove baking sheet from oven and turn on oven's broiler. Top potato nuggets with pepperjack cheese, pulled pork, onion, and jalapeno peppers. Drizzle barbeque sauce over "totchos". Broil in the preheated oven until cheese starts to bubble, 5 to 7 minutes. Top "totchos" with coleslaw and green onions.
