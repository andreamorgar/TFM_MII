Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and chop. Place bacon and onion in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium heat until bacon is evenly brown. Drain excess grease from skillet. Add the sugar and vinegar to the bacon and onion mixture and bring to a boil. Pour the mixture over the potatoes and stir.
