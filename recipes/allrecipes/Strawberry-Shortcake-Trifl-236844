Combine water, sugar, and cornstarch together in a saucepan; cook, stirring constantly, over medium-high heat until mixture is boiling and thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove saucepan from stove and stir gelatin mix into sugar mixture until dissolved. Set strawberry glaze aside to cool. Layer half the strawberries in the bottom of a trifle or glass bowl. Drizzle half the strawberry glaze over strawberry layer until evenly coated. Spread half the whipped topping over strawberry layer; top with pound cake. Layer the remaining strawberries, strawberry glaze, and whipped topping, respectively, over pound cake.
