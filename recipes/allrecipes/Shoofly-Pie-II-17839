Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together flour, 2/3 cup brown sugar, and salt. Cut in butter or margarine until mixture resembles rice. Reserve 3 tablespoons of mixture for sprinkling top of pie. In a separate bowl, mix together hot water, molasses, dark brown sugar, and baking soda. Stir molasses mixture into remaining crumb mixture. Pour into pastry shell. Sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture. Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until top springs back when pressed. Cool on a wire rack.
