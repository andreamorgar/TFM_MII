Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix oats, pumpkin, chocolate chips, flour, butter, sugar, and egg together in a bowl until dough is well mixed and thick; shape into 2 to 3-inch patties. Arrange patties on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.
