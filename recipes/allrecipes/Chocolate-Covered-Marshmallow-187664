Melt the chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval. Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch. Dip the marshmallows in chocolate using a toothpick or fork to hold them. Place on waxed paper or aluminum foil, and freeze. Let marshmallows sit at room temperature for 5 minutes before serving.
