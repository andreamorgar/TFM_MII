Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat 1 cup flour, brown sugar, shortening, molasses, egg, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves in a large bowl until thoroughly combined; stir in remaining 1 1/4 cup flour. Shape dough into 1-inch balls and roll in white sugar; place 2 inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until cookies are set and tops are crackled, 8 to 10 minutes.
