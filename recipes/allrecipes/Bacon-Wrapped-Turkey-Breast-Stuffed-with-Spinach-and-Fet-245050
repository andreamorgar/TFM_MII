Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slice turkey breast down the middle and lay it flat. Sprinkle oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper on the inside of turkey. Arrange spinach leaves in 1 layer on 1 of the pieces of turkey and top with a layer of feta cheese. Repeat layering with spinach and feta cheese. Fold the other turkey breast half over the feta layer so the filling is sealed. Wrap the entire turkey breast with bacon. Place wrapped turkey in a baking dish and season with salt and pepper. Cook turkey breast until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Turn on oven's broiler and broil wrapped turkey until bacon is crisp on each side, about 2 minutes per side. Let turkey rest for 10 minutes before slicing.
