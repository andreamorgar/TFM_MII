Stir pistachios, flax seed, cocoa powder, and coffee beans together in a bowl. Blend figs, dates, cinnamon, agave nectar, and strawberry together in a food processor until thoroughly combined. Stir fruit mixture into pistachio mixture; mix to form a workable dough. Divide dough in half and pat each half into a flat cookie shape. Place cookies on a plate and refrigerate for 1 hour, flipping cookies after 30 minutes.
