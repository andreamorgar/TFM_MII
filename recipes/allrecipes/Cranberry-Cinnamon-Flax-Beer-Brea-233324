Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 5x9-inch loaf pan. Gently whisk flour, flax meal, sugar, baking powder, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Whisk ale into flour mixture; fold in cranberries. Pour batter into the prepared pan; drizzle melted butter over batter. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean, about 1 hour.
