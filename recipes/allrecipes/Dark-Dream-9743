Melt butter in a frying pan and let brown to a dark color. Do not burn. Remove from heat and pour into mixing bowl. Discard any residue and let cool to room temperature. Cream cooled butter with sugar, and stir in vanilla. Resift flour with baking soda and mix into the butter mixture until well blended. Knead dough lightly, cover and refrigerate for one hour. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Roll dough into a log 1 inch in diameter. Cut 1/2-inch thick slices. Shape slices into balls and place on cookie sheets. Press half an almond into top of each ball and Bake 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until the edges are golden. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.
