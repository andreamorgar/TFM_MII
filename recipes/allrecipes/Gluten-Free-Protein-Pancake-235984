Blend cottage cheese, oats, egg whites, and vanilla extract together in a blender until smooth. Spray a griddle or skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
