In a medium bowl, stir together flour, confectioners' sugar, baking powder, and ground cloves. Add beaten eggs and almond extract; mix well. Roll dough into 1/2 inch balls and place firmly on a well greased cookie sheet. Cover cookies with a tea towel and let stand overnight. Cookies will rise and spread. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bake cookies for 10 to 15 minutes until golden brown.
