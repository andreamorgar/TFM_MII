Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 24 non-stick mini-muffin cups. Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir coconut, brown sugar, whole wheat flour, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Add quinoa and eggs to coconut mixture; stir until completely combined. Drop coconut mixture by the tablespoonful into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until slightly crisp and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
