Whisk together pudding mix and cream in a bowl until very thick, about 2 minutes. Spoon mixture evenly into pie crust and smooth. Chill, covered, about 30 minutes. Heat jam in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix blackberries and raspberries together. Mound berries over pudding mixture and drizzle warm jam over top. Chill, loosely covered, at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day.
