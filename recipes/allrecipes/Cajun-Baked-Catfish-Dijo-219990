Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange the catfish in a shallow baking dish; season liberally with salt and pepper. Spread onion slices over the fish. Dot fish with butter. Bake in the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes. Remove baking dish from oven. Preheat the oven's broiler. Mix the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, and hot chile oil together in a bowl. Spread the mayonnaise mixture over the fish. Return the fish to the oven and broil until the sauce is browned and bubbly, 2 to 3 minutes. Garnish with chopped cilantro.
