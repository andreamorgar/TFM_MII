Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8-inch square baking pan. Mix sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Push mixture to the sides of the bowl to form a well in the center. Combine yogurt, coffee, applesauce, and vanilla extract in a small bowl. Pour yogurt mixture into the flour mixture. Fold gently with a spatula until just combined. Spread in the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until center is firm to the touch, 45 to 55 minutes. Cool slightly before cutting into squares, about 15 minutes.
