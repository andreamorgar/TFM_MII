Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a 9-inch pie plate with the crust. Spread crushed candy on the bottom. Mix 1/2 cup sugar, cinnamon, ginger, salt, and cloves together in a small bowl. Beat eggs with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add sugar mixture and pumpkin puree; beat on low speed until smooth. Slowly beat in evaporated milk. Pour mixture over crushed candy in the pie crust. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden, about 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Continue baking until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Remove pie from the oven; cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Cover edges of the pie crust with aluminum foil. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon sugar evenly over the pie. Broil until sugar melts and turns golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Discard aluminum foil. Refrigerate pie until sugar topping hardens, 10 to 15 minutes.
