In a skillet or frying pan, melt butter over medium heat. Add green pepper and onion; saute until tender. Stir in tomato sauce, sugar, Worcestershire sauce and cayenne pepper. Simmer until sauce has thickened, about 10 minutes. While sauce is cooking, beat together eggs and milk. Heat a lightly oiled 6 inch skillet over medium heat. Cook four small omelets, one at time, in the skillet. Season each with salt and pepper and keep them warm while the others are cooked. Serve warm with sauce spooned over each omelet.
