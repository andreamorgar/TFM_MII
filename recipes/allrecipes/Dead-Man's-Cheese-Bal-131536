In the container of a food processor, combine the Cheddar cheese, sour cream, butter, horseradish, hot mustard, chipotle sauce, garlic and port wine. Pulse until smooth. You can use a potato masher in a large bowl but it will take longer. Line a bowl with plastic wrap, and fill with the cheese mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat just until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Gather the plastic wrap around the cheese mixture and form into a ball. Remove the plastic wrap and roll the ball in sesame seeds to coat. Place in the center of a platter and surround with your favorite chips or crackers.
