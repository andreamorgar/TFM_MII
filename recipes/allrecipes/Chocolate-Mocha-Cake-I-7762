Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each one. Sift the flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder together. Set aside. Mix coffee and cocoa together until smooth. Add alternately with the flour mixture to the creamed mixture. Beat for 2 minutes then pour batter into the prepared pans. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 35 minutes.
