Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Soak the bread in warm water in a small bowl. Place the beef in a large bowl. Drain bread and add to beef along with green onion, onion, salsa, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, salt and pepper. Mix by hand until well blended. Form into a loaf and place in a greased loaf pan. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven. Drain off excess fat and top with barbeque (Diana) sauce. Return to the oven and bake for an additional 15 minutes.
