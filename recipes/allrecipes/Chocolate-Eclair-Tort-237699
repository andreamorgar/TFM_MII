Stir milk and vanilla pudding mixes together in a bowl until pudding is thick. Fold whipped topping into pudding. Place 1 layer of graham crackers in the bottom of a 9x13-inch glass dish. Spread a layer of pudding over graham cracker layer; top with a layer of raspberries. Repeat layering with remaining ingredients, ending with graham crackers. Warm frosting in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave until melted, 15 to 30 seconds; drizzle over graham crackers. Refrigerate until torte is set, about 4 hours.
