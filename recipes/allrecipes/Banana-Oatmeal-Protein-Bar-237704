Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square pan. Mix oats, banana, protein powder, peanut butter, cranberries, 1/2 cup coconut, almonds, tea, chia seeds, cinnamon, and vanilla together in a large mixing bowl; spread into prepared pan. Top with 1/4 cup coconut. Bake bars until lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Set aside to cool until they set completely, at least 15 minutes.
