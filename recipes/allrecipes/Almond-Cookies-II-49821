In a large bowl, cream together the butter, sugar, and almond extract until smooth. Combine the flour and salt; stir into the butter mixture until well blended. Cover and refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours or overnight. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Drop cookies by teaspoonfuls onto cookie sheets, and press down slightly with the bottom of a glass. Place a whole almond on top of each cookie. Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm. Remove cookies from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.
