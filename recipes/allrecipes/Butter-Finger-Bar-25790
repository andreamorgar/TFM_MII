Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, stir together the brown sugar, white sugar, melted margarine and oats until well blended. Mix in the chocolate chips. Press the mixture into a 9x9 inch pan. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Spread peanut butter over the top of the bars and let cool until set. Cut into squares and serve.
