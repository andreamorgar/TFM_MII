Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8 inch round pans. In large bowl, blend cake mix, oil, water, undrained pineapple, eggs, and nuts. Beat for 2 minutes with an electric mixer at medium speed. Spread batter into prepared pans. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool. Frost with cream cheese frosting.
