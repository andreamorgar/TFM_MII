Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 9x5-inch loaf pan. Stir almond flour, Parmesan cheese, ground flax seeds, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl with a fork until well-combined. Whisk eggs, almond milk, vinegar, and olive oil together in a large bowl until well-mixed. Pour egg mixture over flour mixture and whisk well until dough comes together, about 1 minute. Dough will be very thick. Pour dough into pan and smooth top. Bake loaf in the preheated oven until golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Set pan on a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes. Cover pan with plate or cooling rack and invert to tip loaf out. Let cool down for 20 to 30 minutes before serving.
