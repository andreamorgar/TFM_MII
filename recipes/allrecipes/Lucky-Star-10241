Sift together 1 1/3 cups flour and 1 1/2 teaspoons double-acting baking powder. Set aside. Cream 1/4 cup butter or margarine. Gradually add 1/4 cup sugar, creaming well. Blend in 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1 teaspoon almond extract, 1/8 teaspoon salt and unbeaten egg. Gradually add the flour and baking soda mixture, mixing thoroughly. To Make Nut Filling: Combine 1 1/4 cups walnuts or pecans, ground or chopped very fine, 1/3 cup sugar and 1/16 teaspoon salt. Add 1 Tablespoon melted butter, 2 Tablespoons water and 1/16 teaspoon maple flavoring. Mix thoroughly. Roll out dough on a floured surface to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut with star-shaped cookie cutter. Place a teaspoonful of Nut Filling in the center of each star. Bring the 5 points upright; starting at the base, pinch sides together so points stand up, allowing filling to show. Place on ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) 7 to 10 minutes until light golden brown.
