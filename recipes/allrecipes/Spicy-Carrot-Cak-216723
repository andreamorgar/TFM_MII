Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt(R) pan. In a bowl, mix together the cake mix, tomato soup, water, eggs, canola oil, carrot, and pecans until the mixture forms a smooth batter. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Invert the pan and turn the cake out onto a cooling rack; cool to room temperature. In a bowl, mix together the confectioners' sugar with lemon juice until smooth; drizzle glaze over cake.
