Cream together the margarine, sugar and eggs. Stir in vanilla, flour, baking soda and salt. Roll out (not too thin) and cut into any shape. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 8 minutes. I have used confectioner sugar frosting, or buttercream frosting, or even canned frosting ( if I'm desperate). Enjoy!
