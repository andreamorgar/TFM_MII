Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add linguine and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain. Place shrimp and crab boil into a large saucepan. Fill with water to 1 inch above the shrimp, and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 3 minutes until shrimp turn pink, then drain. Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in garlic, and red onion, cook until the onion softens and turns translucent, about 4 minutes. Stir in bell pepper, corn, lime juice, cilantro, oregano, chipotle pepper, and salt. Stir in the half-and-half, and bring to a simmer. Once the mixture is simmering, stir in shrimp, and toss with the drained pasta.
