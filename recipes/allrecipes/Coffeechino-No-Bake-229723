Melt butter in a saucepan. Stir sugar, water, cappuccino mix, and coffee granules into the butter; bring to a boil for 1 minute. Add hazelnut spread; stir to melt into the butter mixture. Fold oats into the mixture until evenly coated. Drop mixture by large spoonful onto waxed paper to cool. Drizzle ice cream topping over cooled cookies. Cool in freezer until the topping is hard, at least 1 hour.
