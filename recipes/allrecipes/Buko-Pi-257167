Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat eggs in a bowl; add evaporated milk, buko, sweetened condensed milk, white sugar, and salt. Mix until well blended; pour into a round 3-quart baking dish. Place baking dish in a large baking pan and fill pan with enough water to come halfway up the sides of the dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
