Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan. In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and brown sugar. Mix in eggs until well blended. Stir in the pecans and chopped gumdrops. Press evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm. Allow to cool before cutting into squares.
