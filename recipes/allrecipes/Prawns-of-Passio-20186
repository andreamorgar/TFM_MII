Melt 1/2 cup butter in a saucepan over low heat. Add 1 minced head of garlic and saute for 2 to 3 minutes until soft. Stir in the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Continue cooking until reduced to a thick paste, about 60 to 90 minutes. In a separate saucepan, melt remaining 1/2 cup butter in a saucepan over low heat. Saute remaining garlic for 2 to 3 minutes. Toss prawns in garlic butter sauce and place on a baking sheet. Broil until pink, do not overcook. Spread the warm tomato mixture onto serving plates. Place prawns on top of tomato sauce and sprinkle with chopped parsley.
