Combine water, oats, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a microwave-safe bowl. Cook on high in the microwave until the water is absorbed and oats are tender, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Cook onion, red bell pepper, olives, and black beans in a nonstick skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir onion mixture, salsa, and Cheddar cheese into cooked oatmeal. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat; cook egg to desired doneness, 3 to 5 minutes. Top oatmeal with fried egg. Garnish with diced avocado and sour cream.
