Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. In a medium bowl, stir together the eggs, sugar, carrots, vanilla and oil. Combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt, stir into the carrot mixture. Fold in the pineapple, nuts and raisins. Pour into the prepared pan. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes in the preheated oven, until cake springs back when lightly touched. When cool, frost with cream cheese frosting.
