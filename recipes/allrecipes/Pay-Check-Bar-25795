Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan. In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, brown sugar, baking soda and salt. Mix in the vanilla, butter and egg yolks until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Press into the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly toasted. Remove from the oven and sprinkle mini marshmallows evenly over the hot crust. Let stand while the topping is being made. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt corn syrup and peanut butter chips, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from heat and stir in rice cereal and peanuts. Immediately spread over the layer of marshmallows. Cut while still slightly warm.
