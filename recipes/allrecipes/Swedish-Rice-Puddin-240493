Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish. Stir milk into rice until evenly combined. Mix eggs, sugar, pudding mix, butter, vanilla extract, and salt into rice mixture; transfer to the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the pudding comes out clean, about 1 hour.
