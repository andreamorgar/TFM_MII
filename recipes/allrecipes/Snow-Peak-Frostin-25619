Beat egg whites until soft peaks are formed, then add a dash of salt and beat until firm peaks are formed. In a sauce pan or microwave, heat corn syrup until boiling. Slowly drizzle the corn syrup into the egg whites while beating at high speed. Once entirely incorporated, continue beating at high speed for approximately 6 to 7 minutes. Beat in vanilla.
