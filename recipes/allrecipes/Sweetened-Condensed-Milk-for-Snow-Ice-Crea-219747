Whisk the milk, powdered creamer, and sugar together in a saucepan, and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil, whisking constantly, and cook until thickened, 10 to 12 minutes. Set the mixture aside, and cool thoroughly (mixture will thicken as it cools). Place half the snow into a large mixing bowl, and pour the milk mixture over the snow. Gently stir the snow with the milk mixture until thoroughly combined. Continue to spoon in more snow, about 1 cup at a time, until the snow ice cream has the consistency of soft-serve ice cream. Serve immediately.
