Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly grease 13 x 9 x 2 inch pan. In large mixer bowl combine sugar, butter and egg until creamy (2 or 3 minutes). Reduce mixer speed and add flour, baking powder and salt until blended. Spread batter into baking pan. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until set. Sprinkle chopped chocolate bar over batter and top with marshmallows and peanuts. Continue baking 10 to 12 minutes until marshmallows are lightly browned. Cool and cut into bars.
