Place eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel. Cut each egg in half lengthwise; place yolks in a bowl. Mash yolks with a fork; stir in onion, cream cheese, mayonnaise, horseradish, cumin, and dry mustard. Place egg whites cut-side-up on a serving platter. Spoon yolk mixture into egg white halves; sprinkle with chili powder.
