Sprinkle chicken with salt and place in a large glass or plastic bowl. Whisk together honey, orange juice, butter, rosemary, orange zest, and garlic. Pour orange mixture over chicken; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken legs in a single layer in a roasting pan; pour orange mixture over chicken. Roast for 30 minutes in the preheated oven; reduce temperature to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Baste chicken with pan juices every 20 minutes until chicken is a deep orange brown color, no longer pink at the bone, and juices run clear, about 90 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
