Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and lightly grease a 10x15 inch jelly roll pan. In a large bowl, beat eggs until fluffy. Beat in sugar until fluffiness resumes. Stir in pumpkin and lemon juice. In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Fold dry ingredients into pumpkin mixture. Spread in prepared pan; sprinkle with nuts. Bake in preheated oven 15 minutes. Sprinkle a kitchen towel with confectioner's sugar. Turn cake out onto towel while still hot. Carefully roll cake in towel, long ends together, and let cool completely. To Make Filling: In medium bowl, cream together cream cheese, butter and confectioners' sugar. Stir in vanilla. Carefully unroll cooled cake and remove kitchen towel. Spread cake with filling and re-roll. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
