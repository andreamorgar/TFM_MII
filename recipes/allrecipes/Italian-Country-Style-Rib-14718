Heat the oil in a extra-large skillet over medium-high heat. Add ribs to skillet and brown on all sides. Pour spaghetti sauce over ribs and stir in the water. Reduce heat and simmer, covered for 1 hour. Turn ribs after 1/2 hour of cooking. If the sauce gets too thick, thin it with a little more water.
