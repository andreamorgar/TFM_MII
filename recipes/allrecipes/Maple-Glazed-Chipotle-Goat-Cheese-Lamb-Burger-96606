Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Cut the top off of the head of garlic, and place onto a small, oven safe dish. Bake the garlic in the preheated oven until the cloves are soft and golden brown, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven, and cool. Once cool enough to handle, squeeze the roasted garlic into a mixing bowl. Add the lamb, goat cheese, chipotle peppers, rosemary, 2 tablespoons maple syrup, salt, and pepper; mix well. Form the mixture into 4 patties. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the lamb patties for 1 minute on each side, then reduce the heat to medium-low, and continue cooking to your desired degree of doneness, about 2 minutes per side for medium-well. About 1 minute before the patties are ready, pour in the remaining 2 tablespoons of maple syrup, and allow it to thicken and glaze the burgers. Serve on toasted ciabatta buns.
