Stir salt into water in a large pot and add potatoes; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and cool. Slice potatoes and place in a large bowl. Cook and stir yellow onion, bacon, celery, and pepper rings in a skillet until bacon is browned and celery begins to soften, about 10 minutes. Mix mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, horseradish, pepper juice, lemon juice, and Creole seasoning together in a bowl until well blended. Add bacon mixture and dressing to potatoes; stir to combine. Refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving.
