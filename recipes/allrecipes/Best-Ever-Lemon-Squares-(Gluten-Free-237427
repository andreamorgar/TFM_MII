Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Whisk 1 1/4 cup rice flour, confectioners' sugar, and oat flour together in a bowl. Mix butter into flour mixture until evenly combined; press into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, about 15 minutes. Beat eggs together in a bowl until light and smooth. Combine white sugar, 1/4 cup rice flour, and baking powder together in a separate bowl; stir into beaten eggs until just combined. Stir lemon juice and lemon zest into egg mixture; pour over crust. Bake in the preheated oven until filling is set, about 30 minutes. Cool completely before cutting into bars.
