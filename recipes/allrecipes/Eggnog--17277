In the top of a double boiler, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar and salt. Add milk and mix well. Stir frequently and cook over hot water until mixture thickens to coat a metal spoon. Mix in rum and chill. Beat whipping cream until stiff peaks form. Fold into chilled egg mixture, pour into glasses and top with freshly grated nutmeg.
