Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a roasting pan (large enough to accommodate 8 pepper halves in a single layer) with cooking spray. Combine the ground sirloin, Italian sausage, brown rice, Italian seasonings, salt, pepper, garlic, Parmesan cheese, egg, and 1/2 cup Classico(R) Tomato & Basil sauce in a large bowl. Mix until combined. Divide meat mixture evenly among the green pepper halves; press to compress slightly. Arrange halves in prepared pan. Spoon the remaining Classico(R) Tomato & Basil sauce onto the tops of the meat and peppers. Cover tightly with foil. Bake until the peppers are soft and internal temperature of the meat reaches 165 degrees F, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove from oven. Remove foil and top each pepper with shredded cheese. Turn oven to broil. Place peppers, uncovered under the broiler. Broil until the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley.
