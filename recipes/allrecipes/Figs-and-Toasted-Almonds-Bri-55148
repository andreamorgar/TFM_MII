Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 C). Heat brown sugar and water in a small saucepan over medium heat until sugar is completely dissolved. Add figs and vanilla, and cook until softened, about 10 minutes. Stir in almonds and vanilla. Place brie wheel in a baking dish, and pour fig mixture over the top. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until softened but not melted. Serve with water crackers.
