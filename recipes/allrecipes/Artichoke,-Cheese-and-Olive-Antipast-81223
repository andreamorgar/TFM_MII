Pour the jars of artichoke hearts with their liquid into a 1 1/2 quart or larger container with a tight sealing lid. Add the bell peppers, black olives, and provolone cheese. In a medium bowl, whisk together the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, oregano, garlic, salt and pepper. Pour over the ingredients in the container. Seal the lid, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, shaking gently about once per hour. To serve, allow the mixture to come to room temperature.
