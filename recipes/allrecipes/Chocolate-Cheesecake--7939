Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 55 - 60 minutes or until filling is firm. Turn oven off. Cool cheesecake 1 hour without opening door. Cool completely. Chill several hours or over night. Garnish just before serving with sweetened sour cream made by combining 1 tablespoon sugar with 1/2 cup sour cream.
