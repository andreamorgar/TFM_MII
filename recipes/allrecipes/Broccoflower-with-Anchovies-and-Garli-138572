Cook broccoflower in 2 batches in a 5- to 6-quart pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes, then transfer with a slotted spoon to a large bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking. Drain florets and pat dry with paper towels. Heat oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then saute garlic, stirring, until golden, about 1 minute. Add anchovies and red pepper flakes and saute, stirring, until anchovies are dissolved, about 1 minute, then add florets and toss to coat. Add pine nuts, raisins, and salt to taste and saute, stirring, until heated through, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in parsley.
