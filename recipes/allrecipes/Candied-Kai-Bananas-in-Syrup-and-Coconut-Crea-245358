Mix sugar and water in a wok or large skillet and heat until the syrup starts to boil. Lower heat and cook syrup until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes. Place bananas gently into the syrup and cook until they are shiny and orange in color, about 5 minutes. Flip the bananas to cook on the other side, about 5 minutes. Transfer bananas and syrup to a serving dish. Mix coconut cream and salt in a small saucepan over low heat; simmer until heated through, about 10 minutes. Drizzle coconut cream mixture over bananas to serve.
