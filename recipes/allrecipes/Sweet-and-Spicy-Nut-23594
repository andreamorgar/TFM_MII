Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place the nuts on a large baking pan and bake in the preheated oven 10 to 12 minutes, taking care they do not burn. Remove from heat and let cool approximately 5 minutes. In a small bowl, mix the white sugar, brown sugar, salt, pepper, cumin, curry powder, cloves and cinnamon. In a large saucepan over medium heat, place the nuts and approximately 1/2 the sugar mixture. When the mixture begins to melt, mix in the remaining mixture. Shake the pan until all the nuts are coated, about 5 minutes. Use a spoon to separate nuts that stick together. Remove from heat and cool on a lightly greased baking sheet or wax paper. Separate the nuts to prevent sticking.
