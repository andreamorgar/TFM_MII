In a large frying pan, heat the oil over medium high heat. Add the asparagus, carrots and spaghetti sauce; cook on medium high heat until vegetables are soft. You may add a little water if necessary. Push the vegetables to the side of the pan to create four spaces for the eggs. Crack eggs directly into the holes, being careful not to break the yolk. Cook until eggs are done, but the yolk is still soft. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat and serve immediately.
