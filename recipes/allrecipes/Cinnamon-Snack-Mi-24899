Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix honey graham cereal, bear-shaped graham cookies, ramen noodles, almonds, and golden raisins. In a small saucepan over low heat, melt butter, and blend in honey and orange juice. Spread over the honey graham cereal mixture, and toss to coat. Spread mixture onto a large baking sheet. Bake 10 minutes in the preheated oven.
