Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Combine margarine, confectioner's sugar and vanilla. Beat until fluffy. Add flour, baking soda and oats. Mix well. Stir in cherry flavored chips (other flavors work well, too!). Drop by rounded teaspoonful onto ungreased cookie sheets and flatten slightly with fingers. Bake for 12 minutes. Remove immediately from cookie sheets and onto wire racks to cool.
