Heat the vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Cook the scrapple until crispy and browned on both sides, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Drain the scrapple slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Place a scrapple slice onto a piece of toasted bread, spread with mustard, and top with another slice of bread to assemble.
