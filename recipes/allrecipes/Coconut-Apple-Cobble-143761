Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Stir together apples, caramel topping, and flour in a large round baking dish. Pull apart each biscuit into two halves, and arrange over the apples. Drizzle with butter. Stir together the sugar and coconut; sprinkle over the buttered biscuits. Bake in preheated oven until the biscuits have puffed, and are lightly browned, about 30 minutes.
