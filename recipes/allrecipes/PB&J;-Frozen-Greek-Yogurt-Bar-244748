Mix yogurt, mashed strawberries, 2 tablespoons peanut butter, maple syrup, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spread yogurt mixture in a thin layer onto the parchment paper. Top mixture with sliced strawberries. Stir 2 teaspoons peanut butter and coconut oil together in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until melted, about 30 seconds. Stir well and drizzle over yogurt mixture. Freeze yogurt mixture until solid, at least 2 hours. Break into pieces.
