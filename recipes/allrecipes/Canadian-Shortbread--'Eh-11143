Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Combine the butter, sugar, flour and maple syrup, blend until smooth. On a lightly floured surface roll dough out 1/2 inch thick. Cut into desired shapes and place on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for 20 minutes, watch carefully so as not to overcook. Let cookies cool before eating.
