Cook sausage, onions and peppers in medium nonstick skillet on medium heat 4 to 5 min. or until sausage is done and vegetables are crisp-tender. Remove from skillet. Add eggs to skillet; cook and stir 2 min. or until set. Return sausage mixture to skillet; stir. Top with cheese. Spoon onto tortillas; fold in opposite sides of each tortilla, then roll up burrito-style.
