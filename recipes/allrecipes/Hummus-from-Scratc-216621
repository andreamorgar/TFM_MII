Rinse the garbanzos and soybeans, and place them in a pressure cooker along with the bay leaf and onion. Add vegetable broth and enough water to cover the beans by 1 inch (or follow the manufacturer's instructions for the minimum amount of liquid required). Seal the lid and bring the pressure up to high; reduce the heat to low and cook, maintaining high pressure, for 1 hour. Allow the pressure to drop naturally. Drain the beans, reserving the liquid. Place the beans in the bowl of a food processor. Add the garlic, lemon juice, soy sauce, black pepper, and tahini; process until smooth. (You may add some of the cooking liquid for a thinner consistency.) Scoop the mixture into a bowl, and mix in the parsley.
