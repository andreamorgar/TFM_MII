Mix water and ghee together in a bowl; beat in eggs until mixture is frothy. Add tapioca flour, coconut flour, and sea salt; whisk until batter is smooth. Heat an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Spoon 2 tablespoons batter into the hot skillet, swirling the skillet to cover the bottom evenly. Cook for about 30 seconds; flip and cook other side for 30 seconds. Transfer to a plate and repeat with remaining batter.
