Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix lemon juice, garlic powder, oregano, and basil in a bowl; whisk oil into lemon juice mixture until dressing is well blended. Brush about 1 tablespoon dressing over pita breads and arrange on baking sheet; reserve remaining dressing. Combine spinach, tomatoes, and olives in a large bowl. Pour remaining dressing over vegetables and toss to coat. Divide spinach mixture evenly over each pita; sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and feta cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and pitas are lightly toasted, about 8 minutes.
