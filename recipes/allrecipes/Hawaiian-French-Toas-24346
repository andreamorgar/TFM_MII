In a shallow bowl, whisk together egg yolks, egg white, vanilla, rum extract, orange zest, water and 1 tablespoon honey. Coat bread slices in egg mixture; set aside. In a small saucepan, combine crushed pineapple, mandarin oranges, honey and maple syrup. Simmer over medium-low heat for 3 minutes. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Fry bread slices until brown on both sides. Serve hot with warm fruit sauce.
