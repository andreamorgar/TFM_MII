Beat eggs and sugar. Add oil. Mix in cake meal and cocoa. Add nuts (or use the nuts as a topping). Bake in a greased 9 x 13 inch pan at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 35 minutes. The secret to moist brownies, Pesach or otherwise, is to underbake them. Check them at 30 minutes. I also put nuts on top rather than in the brownies for two reasons: They make the top look good without having to frost them and, for those who don 't or can't eat nuts, they are easily removed without having to search for them.
