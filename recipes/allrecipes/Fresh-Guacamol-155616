Combine the avocado, tomato, onion, serrano chile, salt, pepper, garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and cilantro leaves in a bowl and mix. Pour lime juice over the top of the guacamole. Serve immediately. To store for later use, place avocado pit in the bowl with the guacamole and then cover with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap down to the surface of the guacamole and store in refrigerator.
