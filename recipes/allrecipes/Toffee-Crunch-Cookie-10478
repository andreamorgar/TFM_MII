Combine and sift flour, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, cream butter or margarine. Add sugar, egg, and vanilla; mix until smooth and creamy. Stir in dry ingredients; blend in toffee bits and pecans. Drop tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart onto greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until done, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from baking sheets and cool.
