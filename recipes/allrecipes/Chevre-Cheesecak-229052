Press crumb mixture into bottom of prepared pan; place pan in the freezer. Beat chevre and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth.

Add coconut yogurt, vanilla extract, and gluten-free flour; mix just until incorporated. Pour cheesecake batter into chilled crust and bake in preheated oven for 1 hour.
