Process ricotta cheese and cream cheese in a food processor until smooth and creamy; add egg yolk, melted butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt and process until fluffy. Divide cheese mixture between the crepes. Spread filling into a thin layer and roll crepes around the filling. Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Fry 3 crepes in melted butter until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes per side; repeat with remaining butter and crepes.
