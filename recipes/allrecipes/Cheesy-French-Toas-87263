In a shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, Swiss cheese and chives. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip slices of bread into the egg mixture, then place them in the skillet. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes per side, or until golden and crispy. Serve with sliced ham and tomato chutney.
