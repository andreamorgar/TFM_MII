Mix graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and brown sugar in a bowl. Press crumb mixture into an 8-inch pie dish to form a crust. Whisk eggs and sweetened condensed milk together in large saucepan. Stir lemon juice and tequila into the egg mixture. Slowly bring egg mixture just to a boil over medium-low heat, stirring constantly until thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Pour egg mixture into prepared pie dish. Whisk sour cream and white sugar together in a bowl until well mixed. Spoon sour cream mixture over lemon pie. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.
