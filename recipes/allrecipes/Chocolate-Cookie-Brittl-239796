Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a small baking sheet. Stir flour, sugar, maple syrup, chocolate chips, brownie mix, egg, and baking soda together in a bowl until batter is evenly-mixed. Spoon batter onto prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until set, 7 to 10 minutes. Cool to room temperature and break into pieces.
