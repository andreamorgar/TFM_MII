Slice the French bread on a slant, giving each side of the slice a nice surface area. Slice the brick of cream cheese into 1/2 inch thick slices. Make a slit in each slice of French bread through the crust to form a pocket. Place a slice of cream cheese in each pocket; set aside. In a small bowl, beat together eggs, Irish cream liqueur, cinnamon and nutmeg. Melt butter in a griddle or frying pan over medium-low heat. Briefly dip the bread slices in the egg mixture and place on the griddle. Brown on both sides and serve warm with a dollop of orange marmalade on top.
