Place chicken breasts in a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes. Drain and cool until easily handled. Pour rice into a strainer. Rinse with cold water and drain. Repeat once more. Heat oil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add 1/2 cup sliced ginger and 2 tablespoons crushed garlic; saute until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in rice; reduce heat to medium. Season rice with 1 tablespoon sugar and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cook and stir until rice turns white, adding water to prevent it from burning, about 10 minutes. Remove rice from heat and add pandan leaves. Transfer to a rice cooker. Pour in chicken stock. Cook rice according to manufacturer's instructions until tender. Fluff lightly with a rice paddle. Combine 1 cup chopped ginger, 1/2 cup chopped garlic, chile peppers, 6 tablespoons sugar, dark soy sauce, soy sauce, lime juice, vinegar, soybean paste, cilantro, chicken bouillon granules, and 1 teaspoon salt in a blender; blend into a smooth sauce. Pour sauce into a pot over medium heat. Simmer for 5 minutes. Slice chicken and serve over rice, with sauce alongside.
