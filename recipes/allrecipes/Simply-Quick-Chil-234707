Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 7 to 10 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir corn, kidney beans, and chili seasoning mix into the beef and sausage. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook at a simmer until hot, 20 to 30 minutes.
