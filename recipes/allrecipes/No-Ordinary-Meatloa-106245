Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5 inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray. In food processor or blender, pulse stuffing mix to fine crumbs; place in large bowl. Stir in ground beef, ground pork, onion, green pepper, tomatoes, eggs, seasoned salt, seasoning blend, and pepper. Use your hands to mix very well; pat into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 45 minutes to 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (72 degrees C). Cool for 5 to 10 minutes before slicing.
