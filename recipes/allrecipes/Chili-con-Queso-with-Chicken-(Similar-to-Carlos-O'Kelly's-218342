Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the tomato, onion, and garlic until the tomato has released its juice and the juice has become thick and syrupy, about 10 minutes. Mix in the processed cheese cubes, and stir until melted and smooth. Stir in the sour cream, shredded chicken, green chiles, salsa, seasoned salt, and oregano until thoroughly mixed, and cook until hot but not simmering, about 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Serve hot.
