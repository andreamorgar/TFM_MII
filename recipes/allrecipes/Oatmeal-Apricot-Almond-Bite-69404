Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. In a large bowl, blend the applesauce, brown sugar, and honey. In a separate bowl, sift together the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Blend the flour mixture into the applesauce mixture. Fold in the oats, vanilla extract, almond extract, apricots, almonds, and cranberries. Drop the batter by rounded teaspoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Cool on wire racks.
