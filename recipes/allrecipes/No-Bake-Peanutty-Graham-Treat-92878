Spray a 9x13 inch baking pan with nonstick spray; set aside. Melt the peanut butter, butter, and marshmallows in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring until smooth. Stir in the honey. Remove from heat; stir in the honey graham cereal. Press the mixture evenly into the prepared pan with a greased spatula. Allow to cool; cut into squares to serve.
