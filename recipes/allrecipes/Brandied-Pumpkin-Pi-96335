Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Whisk together the eggs, pumpkin, milk, brown sugar, brandy, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg in a large bowl until smooth. Pour the mixture into the pie crusts. Cover the outside edge of each pie with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes; remove foil. Continue to bake until a knife inserted near the center of a pie comes out clean, about 25 minutes more. Cool completely on a wire rack before serving. Store unused portion in refrigerator.
