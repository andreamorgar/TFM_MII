In a bowl, mash the cream cheese with the ranch dressing mix until thoroughly combined, then stir in the Cheddar cheese. Mix in beer, 1 tablespoon at a time, until you reach the desired consistency (add more for a thinner dip). Stir in the seasoned salt and cayenne pepper. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour.
