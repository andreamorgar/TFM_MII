Line a 13x9-inch baking dish with baking parchment. Mix oats, flaxseed meal, raisins, cranberries, and protein powder together in a small bowl. Combine chocolate chips, honey, and peanut butter together in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave oven, stirring every 30 seconds, until the chocolate chips are nearly melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir oats mixture with the chocolate mixture until evenly mixed; spread into prepared baking dish. Refrigerate bars until hardened, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove bars from dish by lifting parchment; cut into squares using a pizza cutter.
