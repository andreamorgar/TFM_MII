Cook and stir bacon with butter in a skillet over medium heat until crisp. Drain bacon fat, set bacon aside, and place skillet back onto medium heat. Add jalapeno, red pepper, diced celery, garlic, and green onions; cook and stir until vegetables start to soften, about 3 minutes. Pour in reserved clam juice and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated. Transfer vegetable mixture to plate to cool. Open second can of clams and drain juice, combine with reserved clams, cream cheese, bacon, cooled vegetables, juice from lemon, and freshly ground black pepper and hot sauce to taste. Transfer to serving bowl and garnish with chopped bacon and green onion. Serve with crackers.
