In a large skillet, heat oil and saute garlic until light brown and softened. Be careful not to burn the garlic. Stir in tomatoes, sugar, water, basil, and salt and pepper. Bring contents of the pan to a boil. Cover and simmer on low heat for approximately 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve warm.
