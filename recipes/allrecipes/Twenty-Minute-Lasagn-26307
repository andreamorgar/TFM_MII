Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place ground beef in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine spaghetti sauce mix, mushroom gravy mix, tomato paste, water and oil. Bring to a boil and stir in ground beef. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. In a 9x13 inch baking dish layer the noodles, sauce and cheese; repeat layers, ending with cheese. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes.
