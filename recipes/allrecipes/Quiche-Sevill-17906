Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake thawed pastry shell at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the sour cream, bacon, cheese, French-fried onions, eggs, Worcestershire sauce and ground black pepper. Mix all together well and pour into the cooled pie shell. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 to 45 minutes, or until quiche is set.
