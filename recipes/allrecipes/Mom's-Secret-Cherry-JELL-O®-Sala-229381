Dissolve gelatin completely in 2 cups hot water and pour into desired mold. Mix crushed pineapple, bananas, and 1 1/2 cup cold water into gelatin mixture; top with miniature marshmallows. Chill until firm. Whisk reserved pineapple juice, sugar, flour, and egg in a saucepan over low heat and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture almost comes to a simmer and becomes thick, about 5 minutes. Mix cream cheese into sauce, transfer to a large bowl, and cool to room temperature. Stir whipped topping into cream cheese mixture. Spread over gelatin. Chill thoroughly before serving.
