Place eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel. Cut eggs in half lengthwise; place egg yolks in a small bowl. Mash yolks with a fork; stir mayonnaise, Sriracha sauce, dry mustard, and cayenne pepper into yolks until smooth; season with salt. Spoon yolk mixture into a resealable plastic bag; snip off one corner of the bag. Place egg whites cut-side up on a serving platter. Pipe the yolk mixture into egg white halves; sprinkle with smoked paprika. Refrigerate deviled eggs, covered, until ready to serve.
