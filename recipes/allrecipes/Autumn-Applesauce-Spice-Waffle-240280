Heat waffle iron according to directions. Mix together apple (or cherry) pie filling and water in a saucepan; heat until warm over medium heat. Keep warm. Mix flour, salt, baking powder, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, mix together eggs, milk, melted butter, applesauce, and vanilla. Add dry ingredients and stir to blend. Batter will be thick. Brush waffle iron generously with oil or melted butter, or spray with an oil spray. Ladle batter into the preheated oiled waffle iron. Cook until crispy, generally 4-6 minutes. Top with warm pie filling and a dollop of whipped cream.
