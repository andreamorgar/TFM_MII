Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir steak and ground black pepper in hot oil until browned on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir onions into beef; saute until onions are translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir green bell peppers, yellow bell pepper, and red bell pepper into beef mixture one pepper at a time. Cook and stir until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour diced tomatoes, kidney beans, black beans, corn, and tomato sauce into beef-pepper mixture. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors blend and meat is tender, about 1 hour.
