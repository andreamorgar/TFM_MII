Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish with coconut oil. Drain zucchini and onion in a colander until no longer wet, about 10 minutes. Beat eggs, almond flour, green onions, garlic, onion powder, basil, sea salt, and black pepper together in a large mixing bowl until smooth; stir zucchini and onion into the egg. Pour the egg mixture into the prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until set in the center, 35 to 40 minutes.
