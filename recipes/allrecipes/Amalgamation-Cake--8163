Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour 3 8-inch cake pans. Mix flour, soda, cloves, and cinnamon; add 1 cup raisins, 1 cup nuts, and 1 cup coconut and mix well. Set aside. Cream 2 cups sugar and 1 1/2 cups butter. Stir in jam. Add buttermilk alternately with flour mixture, mixing with a spoon, until all is used up, ending with flour mixture. In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until they hold a peak. Fold into other mixture. Pour into prepared cake pans. Bake approximately 30 minutes or until top springs back when lightly touched. Cool and frost. To make frosting: mix 4 egg yolks until they are broken up and smooth, add 1/2 cup evaporated milk and mix together until the eggs yolks are mixed well with milk. Add rest of evaporated milk, 2 cups sugar, and 1/2 cup butter. Cook until thick and remove from heat. Stir in 2 cups nuts, 2 cups raisins, and 2 cups coconut. Cool slightly while beating mixture with a spoon. Spread on cooled cake.
