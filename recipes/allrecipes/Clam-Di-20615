Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine the clams, lemon juice, onion, butter, pepper, and bread crumbs in a mixing bowl, and stir until blended. Pour the mixture into a baking dish, and sprinkle the top with Cheddar cheese. Bake until the mixture is bubbly, about 20 minutes. Serve warm.
