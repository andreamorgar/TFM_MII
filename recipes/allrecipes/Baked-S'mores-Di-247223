Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Break chocolate bars into a saucepan over low heat. Add milk. Heat, stirring constantly, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Pour into 8-1/2x6-1/2-inch casserole dish. Arrange marshmallows over melted chocolate. Bake dip in the preheated oven until marshmallows are golden brown, 4 to 7 minutes. Serve dip with graham crackers.
