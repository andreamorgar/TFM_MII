Butter one 3 quart casserole dish and set aside. Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until crumbled and evenly brown. Drain and set aside. Place bread cubes in prepared casserole dish. Whisk together the eggs, soup, milk and salt; pour over bread cubes. Add sausage and sprinkle with shredded cheese. Cover with foil and refrigerate overnight. The next morning, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake for 1 hour.
