Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix flour, oil, and salt together in a bowl; add water and mix using a pastry cutter until dough is soft. Form dough into 6 balls and press into disks onto the prepared baking sheet using your hands. Bake in the preheated oven until bread is cooked, 8 to 10 minutes.
