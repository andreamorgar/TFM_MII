In a saucepan, mix gelatin with boiling water, stir until dissolved and add cold water. In a large bowl, combine the gelatin and frozen strawberries. Chill until slightly thickened (consistency of egg whites). If adding lots of frozen strawberries, it may reach this stage while stirring in. Gently fold in cake cubes and whipped topping. Chill until set. Decorate top with any extra whipped topping or strawberries.
