Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, and stir in the onion. Cook and stir until the onion is soft and beginning to brown, about 8 minutes. Stir in the curry paste, cook for 2 minutes longer, then add the coconut milk water, and pumpkin. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the pumpkin is nearly tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the butter beans, and continue simmering until the pumpkin is tender, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then stir in the spinach and cilantro. Simmer a few more minutes to reheat, and serve.
