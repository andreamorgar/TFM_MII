Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil or waxed paper. In a medium bowl, mix together the butter, peanut butter, confectioners' sugar and powdered milk until smooth. Mix in the cornflakes. Wet hands and roll tablespoonfuls of dough into balls. Place them onto the prepared cookie sheet, cover and refrigerate overnight. The next day, melt chocolate in a metal bowl over simmering water, stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove bowl from heat. Using a fork, dip the balls into the chocolate and return them to the foil covered cookie sheet. Refrigerate until firm. These can be made up to a week ahead if kept refrigerated.
