Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the cream cheese and crabmeat into a small microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave for about 1 minute, to soften the cream cheese. Stir in the shredded cheese until everything is well blended. Unroll crescent dough on a clean work surface, and separate the triangles. Place a spoonful of the crab mixture onto the wide end of each crescent. Roll towards the point, and pinch the ends together to seal. Place rolls on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Serve warm.
