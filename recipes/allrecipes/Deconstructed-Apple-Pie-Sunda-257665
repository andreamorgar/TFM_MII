Combine apples, brown sugar, butter, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until apples begin to soften, about 10 minutes. Add pecans and cook 2 minutes more. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Scoop ice cream into 4 bowls and top with apple topping. Sprinkle toffee bits over apple topping.
