Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x4 inch loaf pan, and line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper. Place the dates in a small bowl, and sprinkle the baking soda over. Heat coffee to boiling, and pour over the dates and soda. Set aside. In a medium bowl, mix together the butter, sugar and egg until well blended. Stir in vanilla. Blend in the flour and salt, then fold in the pecans and date mixture. Transfer the batter to the prepared loaf pan. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until the top of the loaf springs back when lightly touched. Let stand for 5 minutes before removing from pan. Peel off paper, and allow to cool on a wire rack.
