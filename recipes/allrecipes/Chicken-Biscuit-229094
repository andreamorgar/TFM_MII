Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken tenderloins in hot oil until the juices run clear and meat is no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes, turning once. Chop chicken. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 16 muffin cups with cooking spray. Split each biscuit in half and press dough halves into prepared muffin cups, shaping the dough into the bottom and up the sides of each muffin cup. Mix chicken and with cream of chicken soup, mixed vegetables, and half the Cheddar cheese in a bowl. Spoon a heaping tablespoon of chicken, vegetables, and sauce into each dough cup and top each with 1 1/2 teaspoon of remaining Cheddar cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until biscuit cups are slightly browned and puffed, the cheese is melted, and the filling is hot, about 14 minutes.
