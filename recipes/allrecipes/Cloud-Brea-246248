Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place cream cheese in a microwave-safe bowl and warm in the microwave at 10-second intervals until softened, about 30 seconds. Cool to room temperature, about 5 minutes. Mix in egg yolks until smooth. Place egg whites and baking powder in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl; beat together until stiff peaks form. Fold yolk mixture gently into egg whites until batter is just combined and light yellow in color. Scoop batter into 4-inch rounds on baking sheet, flattening peaks with the back of the spoon. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 17 to 20 minutes.
