Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square pan. Mix graham cracker crumbs, sweetened condensed milk, chocolate chips, walnuts, coconut, and butter in a bowl; press into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Pour confectioners' sugar into a shallow bowl. While still warm, shape mixture into 1-inch balls and roll in confectioners' sugar.
