Cut the venison tenderloin into 12 strips lengthwise. Toss with Italian dressing, and allow to marinate for 1 hour in the refrigerator. Preheat a grill for medium heat. To assemble the venison wraps, lay a strip of venison on top of a strip of bacon. Place a teaspoon of cream cheese at one end, and top with a slice of jalapeno. Roll up and secure with a skewer. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Season the wraps with desired amount of seasoning salt. Grill for 10 minutes, then turn over, and continue cooking until the bacon is crisp.
