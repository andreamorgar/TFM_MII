Tie a sheet of cheesecloth over a large bowl. Pour the yogurt onto the cheesecloth and place in refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours to drain. Press the yogurt firmly with a spoon to release any excess liquid. The remaining yogurt should be thick. Transfer the yogurt to a clean bowl. Soak the saffron threads in the warm milk for 10 minutes; stir into the yogurt. Add the sugar, pistachio nuts, and cardamom and mix well. Stir the food coloring into the mixture until you get the color you like. Refrigerate until completely chilled, about 1 hour.
