Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a loaf pan with cooking spray. Whisk eggs and milk together in a bowl. Add pork, bread crumbs, bell pepper, green onion, mustard, and pepper; stir. Transfer pork mixture to the prepared loaf pan. Press pork tightly into pan and spread barbeque sauce on top. Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 1 hour. Let meatloaf cool 5 to 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
