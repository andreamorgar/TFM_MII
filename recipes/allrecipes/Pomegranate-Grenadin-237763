Combine 3 cups pomegranate juice and sugar together in a saucepan; heat to 244 degrees F (118 degrees C) or until a small amount of mixture dropped into cold water forms a firm ball. Remove saucepan from heat and cover with a lid; let cool until pan is cool enough to touch. Stir remaining 1 cup pomegranate juice into mixture. Refrigerate.
