Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir chicken until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 5 minutes. Add broccoli slaw mix, sesame oil, and water; simmer on medium-low heat until liquid is reduced and broccoli slaw is tender, about 15 minutes. Fold in peanut sauce and salt.
