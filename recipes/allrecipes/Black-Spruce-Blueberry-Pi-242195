Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a pie plate with 1 of the pie pastries. Stir sugar, flour, chocolate syrup, cinnamon, Key lime pepper, and ancho chile powder together in a large bowl. Add blueberries and stir to coat; pour into prepared pie plate. Sprinkle lemon juice and butter pieces over blueberry mixture. Top with remaining pie pastry, crimp edges together to seal, and cut slits in the top to vent. Cover the edge of the crust with a thin strip of aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove and discard foil. Continue baking until crust is golden and filling is bubbling, about 15 minutes more. Cool completely.
