Grease a 2-quart casserole dish. Spread bread cubes in the bottom of the prepared casserole dish. Pour butter over bread cubes and top with pineapple. Beat eggs and sugar together in a bowl until foamy; pour over bread mixture. Cover dish with aluminum foil and refrigerate, about 3 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and bake until browned, 5 to 20 minutes.
