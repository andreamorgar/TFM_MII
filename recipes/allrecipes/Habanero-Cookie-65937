Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix the peppers, sugar, butter, vanilla, and eggs. Beat until smooth. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir into the pepper mixture just until combined. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. Cool on wire racks.
