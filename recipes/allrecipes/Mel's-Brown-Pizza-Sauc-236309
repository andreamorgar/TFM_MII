Working in batches, puree onions, celery, mushrooms, and garlic and 1/4 cup chicken broth in a food processor until smooth, adding more chicken broth as necessary. Stir vegetable puree and remaining chicken broth together in large pot; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until flavors blend, about 45 minutes. Stir tomato paste, oregano, black pepper, sugar, celery salt, basil, onion powder, and seasoned salt into broth mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until flavors blend, about 45 minutes more. Whisk oil and flour into tomato mixture until pizza sauce is smooth.
