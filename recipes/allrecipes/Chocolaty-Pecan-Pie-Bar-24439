Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan. In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and confectioners' sugar until smooth. Combine the flour and cocoa; stir in to the creamed mixture. Bake for 12 minutes in the preheated oven. In a small bowl, stir together the egg, sweetened condensed milk and pecans. Pour over the prepared crust. Bake for an additional 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until set and lightly browned. Cool in pan before cutting into bars.
