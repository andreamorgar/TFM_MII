Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange the apricots in a 9x12-inch baking dish and sprinkle with white sugar. Mix together brown sugar and flour in a bowl; cut in the butter with a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Lightly stir in the rolled oats and spoon the mixture over the apricots. Bake in the preheated oven until the fruit is soft and the topping is browned and crisp, 35 to 40 minutes.
