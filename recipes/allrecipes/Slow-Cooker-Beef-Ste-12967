The night before, cut up potatoes and carrots and slice onions. Put all the vegetables in a plastic container filled with water overnight. Also the night before, marinate the stew meat with Worcestershire sauce and herb seasoning in a plastic storage bag. Place in the refrigerator. In the morning, put the raw beef in the bottom of your slow cooker. Drain the vegetables, and pour in on top of the beef. Pour in the stewed tomatoes and tomato juice. If you like your stew a little spicy, add a chopped jalapeno pepper or two. Turn the slow cooker on high for 1 hour. Then, set your slow cooker to low for 6-8 hours. The beef will cook completely, and will be very tender.
