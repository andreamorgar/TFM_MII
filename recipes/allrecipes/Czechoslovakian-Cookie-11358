Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease one 8 inch square baking dish. Cream the butter until soft and fluffy. Add the white sugar gradually, until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg yolks. Sift the cardamom, allspice and flour together. Gradually add it to the butter mixture and stir to combine well. Stir in the chopped pecans. Spoon 1/2 of the dough into the prepared pan, spreading evenly. Top with strawberry jam and cover with the remaining dough. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 1 hour or until lightly browned. Cool then cut into 1 1/2 inch sized squares.
