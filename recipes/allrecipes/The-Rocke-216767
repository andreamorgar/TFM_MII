Place half the ice into a bowl; divide the other half of the ice between 2 bowls (1/4 cup of ice in each). Place blue curacao liqueur and 1/2 fluid ounce of lemon vodka into a bowl containing 1/4 cup of ice. Mix well. Place raspberry liqueur and 1/2 fluid ounce of lemon vodka into the other 1/4 cup of ice and mix well. Mix the remaining 1 fluid ounce of lemon vodka into the bowl containing 1/2 cup of ice. Layer the blue curacao-flavored ice into the bottom of a glass. Place the lemon vodka-flavored ice over the blue layer; top with the raspberry-flavored ice.
