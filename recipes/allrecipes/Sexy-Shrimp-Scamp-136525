Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Toss the shrimp in a bowl with the olive oil, melted butter, garlic, salt, and pepper; set aside for 10 minutes. Arrange the shrimp in a circular pattern in a round casserole dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the shrimp are pink and cooked through, about 15 minutes.
