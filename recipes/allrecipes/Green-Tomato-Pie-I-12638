Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Roll pastry and line a 9 inch deep-dish pie plate. In a large bowl, combine sliced tomatoes, sugar, lemon juice, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. Toss lightly to mix. Pour into pastry lined deep-dish pie plate. Put little dabs of butter in about 4 or 5 places around the top of pie then cover with pastry. Make slits wherever you please. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 10 minutes then reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until golden and bubbly.
