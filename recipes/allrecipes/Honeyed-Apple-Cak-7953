In a large bowl, cream the butter or margarine with the brown sugar. Beat in the eggs, then the honey, lemon rind, and coffee. In another bowl, stir together the flours, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Beat into the creamed mixture. Stir in the apples and walnuts. Turn the batter into a greased and floured tube pan. Bake the cake into a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until it tests done with a toothpick. Let cool on a rack. Makes 16 servings.
