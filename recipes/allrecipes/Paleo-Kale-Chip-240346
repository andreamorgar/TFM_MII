Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Put kale in a bowl and add coconut oil; mix with your hands until evenly coated. Spread coated kale onto the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle garlic salt, salt, and pepper over kale. Place baking sheet in the oven and turn off oven. Leave kale in the oven until crisp, about 20 minutes.
