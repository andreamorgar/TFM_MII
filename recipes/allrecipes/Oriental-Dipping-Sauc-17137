In a small mixing bowl, combine soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, green onion, water, hoisin sauce, ginger, and sugar. Mix well, add additional hoisin sauce to thicken mixture to your desired consistency if needed. Cover the sauce, and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours to allow flavors time to blend. Before serving, pour mixture into a small saucepan and heat. Serve warm.
