Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Combine egg whites, cream of tartar, and vanilla. Beat until the whites form soft peaks. Slowly add sugar; beat until stiff peaks form, and mixture becomes glossy. Fold in cocoa and chocolate chips. Drop mixture by teaspoonfuls on to a greased cookie sheet. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes.
