Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes; cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl; cool, peel and dice. Add olives, celery and onions to potatoes and gently mix. Whisk together the vinegar, oil, salt, dill weed and pepper. Pour over potatoes and mix gently to coat. Refrigerate. Whisk together yogurt, mustard, honey and garlic salt. Pour over potato mixture and stir gently but thoroughly. Chill and serve.
