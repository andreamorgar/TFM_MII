Cut chicken into bite-size pieces. Wrap with about 1/3 slice of bacon, thread onto toothpick, and top with pineapple chuck. Marinate for 4 hours or longer in teriyaki sauce. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place marinated appetizers onto parchment lined baking sheets. Bake for 20 minutes, or until chicken is done and bacon golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Serve hot.
