Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Add the flour mixture alternately with the potatoes and milk. Stir in nuts and raisins. Pour into a 10 inch Bundt pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 90 to 120 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.
