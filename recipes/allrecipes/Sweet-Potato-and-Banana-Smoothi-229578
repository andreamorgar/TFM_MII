Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake sweet potato in the preheated oven until tender and cooked through, about 1 hour. Remove peel from cooked sweet potato and cool in the refrigerator 8 hours or overnight. Blend sweet potato, banana, soy milk, and cinnamon together in a blender until smooth.
