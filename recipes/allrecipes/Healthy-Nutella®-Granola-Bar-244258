Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x11-inch baking dish. Stir raisins, 3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons applesauce, chocolate-hazelnut spread, brown sugar, honey, corn syrup, vanilla extract, ground cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Combine oats and flour together in a resealable plastic bag, shake until mixed. Stir oat mixture into chocolate-hazelnut mixture; spread granola into prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until lightly brown, about 15 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack before cutting into bars, about 1 hour.
