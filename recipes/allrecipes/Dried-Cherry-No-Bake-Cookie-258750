Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Soak cherries in a pot of boiling water for about 10 minutes. Drain and pat dry with a paper towel. Combine oats and shredded coconut in a food processor; grind until fine. Blend in peanut butter, honey, and coconut oil. Add cherries and chocolate chips to the cookie dough; pulse until well-broken. Pour dough into the prepared pan. Press to evenly cover the bottom of the pan. Cool for at least 3 hours. Cut the cooled dough into 40 bars.
