Add the egg, beating well, then stir in the sour cream and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; gradually stir into the creamed mixture. Fold in cashew pieces. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. To make the frosting, melt 1/2 cup butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook until butter turns a light brown color, be careful not to burn it. Remove from heat and stir in the cream. Gradually beat in the confectioners' sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla until smooth. Spread onto cooled cookies.
