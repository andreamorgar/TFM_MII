In a large saucepan, combine the eggs, milk and 1/3 cup sugar. Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture coats a metal spoon. Remove from heat. Cool quickly by placing pan in a sink or bowl of ice water and stirring 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the vanilla. Chill 4 to 24 hours. Before serving, whip the cream and 2 tablespoons sugar until soft peaks form. Transfer chilled egg mixture to a punch bowl. Fold in whipped cream mixture and serve at once. Sprinkle each serving with nutmeg.
