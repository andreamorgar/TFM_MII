Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange the blueberries in the bottom of a casserole dish; sprinkle 1 cup sugar over the blueberries. Cream together the shortening, 1/2 cup sugar, and egg. Add the milk, flour, baking powder, and salt. Beat until evenly combined. Drop by spoonfuls on top of the blueberries. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.
