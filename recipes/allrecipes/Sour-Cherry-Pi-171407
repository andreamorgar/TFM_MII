Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Press one of the pie crusts into a 9 inch pie plate. Stir together the cherries, tapioca, sugar, and almond extract in a bowl. Let the mixture stand for 3 to 5 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the other pie crust into 1/2 inch strips to make a lattice top. Pour the cherry mixture into the pie shell. Lay the strips across the pie in a lattice pattern, and pinch the edges to seal. Bake in the preheated oven 40 to 50 minutes until the crust is golden brown. Allow to cool before serving.
