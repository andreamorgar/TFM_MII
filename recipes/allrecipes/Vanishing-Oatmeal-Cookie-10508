Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat margarine and sugars, until creamy. Add eggs and vanilla; beat well. Combine flour, baking soda, salt, and spices. Sift and add to the egg mixture. Stir well. Grind the raisins up with 1 teaspoon of sugar until they are in small pieces--not mush! Stir in oats, nuts, raisins and mix well, drop by tablespoonful onto ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until light brown. Cool 1 minute and remove to wire rack. When cool store in airtight container. NOTE: You can add butterscotch or chocolate pieces in place of the raisins.
