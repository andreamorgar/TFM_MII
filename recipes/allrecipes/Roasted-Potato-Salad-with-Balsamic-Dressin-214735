Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Cut the potatoes into 3/4-inch chunks, and place into a bowl. Drizzle with canola oil, and spread out onto a baking sheet. Turn potatoes so skin sides are down. Sprinkle the potatoes with thyme, chili powder, kosher salt, and pepper. Bake in the preheated oven until the potatoes are golden brown, about 45 minutes. Remove and allow to cool. In a large salad bowl, lightly toss the cooled potatoes, green onions, roasted red peppers, olives, artichoke hearts, parsley, and Gorgonzola cheese until thoroughly combined. Place the balsamic vinegar, olive oil, Dijon mustard, garlic, oregano, and basil into a blender, and pulse a few times until the dressing is thickened and creamy. Season to taste with salt and pepper, pour over the potato salad, and toss lightly. Chill for 4 hours before serving.
