Line 10 muffin cups with paper liners. Stir cookie crumbs and butter together in a bowl; press into the prepared muffin cups. Refrigerate chocolate crusts until chilled, about 15 minutes. Beat peanut butter, cream cheese, and confectioners' sugar together in a bowl until smooth. Spoon peanut mixture over the chocolate crusts; refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes. Pour cream into a microwave-safe bowl and heat in microwave until just before boiling, about 2 minutes. Stir chocolate into cream to melt. Refrigerate ganache until completely chilled, about 1 hour. Beat ganache using an electric mixer until whipped; spread evenly over peanut butter mixture layer. Freeze cheesecakes until solid, about 1 hour.
