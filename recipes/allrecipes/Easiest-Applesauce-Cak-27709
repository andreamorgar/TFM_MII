Preheat oven at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease and flour three 8x4 inch loaf pans. In a large bowl, stir together cake mix, instant pudding mix, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Add the applesauce, oil, eggs and water. Blend for 3 to 4 minutes using an electric mixer. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake for 50 to 55 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
