Heat the oil in a 6-quart saucepot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and peppers and cook for 2 minutes or until tender-crisp, stirring occasionally. Stir in the tomato paste, corn, beans, tomatoes, broth and chicken and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve topped with crushed tortilla chips or strips, if desired.
