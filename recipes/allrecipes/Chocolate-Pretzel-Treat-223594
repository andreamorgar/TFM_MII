Preheat oven to 175 degrees F ( 80 degrees C). Arrange pretzels on a baking sheet. Place a candy kiss on the center of each pretzel. Warm pretzels in the preheated oven until candy kiss is shiny and slightly softened, 2 minutes. Place a candy-coated chocolate piece atop the candy kiss on each pretzel; press down. Chill in the refrigerator for 10 minutes.
