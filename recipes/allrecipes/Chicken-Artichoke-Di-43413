Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, blend chicken, artichoke, Italian-style dressing mix, sour cream, mayonnaise, 1/2 cup Havarti, and Parmesan. Transfer to a small baking dish. Top with remaining Havarti and almonds. Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until bubbly and lightly browned.
