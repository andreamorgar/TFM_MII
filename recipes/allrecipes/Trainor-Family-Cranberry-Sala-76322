In a medium bowl, whisk together the gelatin mix and boiling water until gelatin is dissolved. Stir in the cold water. Transfer to a gelatin mold, or keep in a bowl; cover and refrigerate. Place the oranges, lemon, apples, and cranberries into a bowl. Sprinkle the sugar over the top. Set aside so the fruit has time to bleed. When the gelatin is partially set, stir in the fruit. Chill until set, preferably overnight. It becomes tastier with age!
