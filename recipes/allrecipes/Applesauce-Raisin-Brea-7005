Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 inch loaf pan. Soak raisins in apple juice. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, soda, cinnamon, oats, and brown sugar. Add applesauce, oil, eggs, and milk; stir until just combined. Mix in raisins. Spread batter into prepared pan. Bake for 55 to 60 minutes. Remove from pan immediately, and cool on a wire rack.
