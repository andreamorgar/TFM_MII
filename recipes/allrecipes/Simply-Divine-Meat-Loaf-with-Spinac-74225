Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix the ground beef, eggs, sour cream, Worcestershire sauce, dry onion soup mix, Parmesan cheese, salad dressing, bread crumbs, and spinach. Transfer to a 5x9 inch pan, and cover with aluminum foil. Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove foil, and continue baking 15 minutes, to a minimum internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Let stand 5 minutes before slicing.
