Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix all-purpose flour, almonds, butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and almond extract in a large bowl until well blended. Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
