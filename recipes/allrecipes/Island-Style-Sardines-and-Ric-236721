Melt coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat; add tomato, onion, garlic, and scotch bonnet chile pepper. Cook and stir tomato mixture until onion is almost translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour sardines and soybean oil into tomato-onion mixture; mash fish with a fork until incorporated. Cover skillet, reduce to low, and cook until sardines are heated through, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve sardine mixture over rice.
