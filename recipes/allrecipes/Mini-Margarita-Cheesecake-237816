Beat sweetened condensed milk and cream cheese together using an electric mixer on low speed until smooth and creamy. Add limeade, tequila, and triple sec; beat on medium-high speed until cheesecake mixture is creamy and thickened, 5 to 8 minutes. Spoon about 1 tablespoon cheesecake mixture into each scoop-style tortilla chip. Arrange mini cheesecakes on a platter; refrigerate until chilled and set, 2 hours to overnight. Beat cream and lime juice together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and thickened; gradually add sugar and continue beating until soft peaks form. Top each cheesecake with about 1 teaspoon lime-flavored whipped cream.
