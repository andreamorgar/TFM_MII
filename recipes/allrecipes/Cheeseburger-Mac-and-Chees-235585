Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Stir the soup, milk, black pepper, pasta and 3/4 cup cheese in a medium bowl. Arrange the meatballs in the bottom of an 11x8x2-inch baking dish. Pour the soup mixture over the meatballs. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake for 25 minutes or until the mixture is hot and bubbling.
