Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in one egg yolk until completely incorporated. Beat in the other egg yolk along with the orange juice and vanilla. Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut into desired holiday shapes with cookie cutters. Place cookies on prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
