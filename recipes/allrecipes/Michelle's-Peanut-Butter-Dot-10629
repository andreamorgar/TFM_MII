In large mixing bowl, combine sugar, butter, peanut butter, milk and vanilla. Mix by hand about 3 minutes or until creamy. Thoroughly mix flour into creamy mix. Roll small balls of dough in hand, about 1 inch in diameter. Place on greased cookie sheet, approximately 3/4 inch apart. Using a fork, make criss cross pattern on cookie (this will flatten cookie partially). Be careful not to over flatten, dough should not touch each other. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) 18 to 25 minutes.
