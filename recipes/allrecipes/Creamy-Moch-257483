Combine mochiko and sugar in a large microwave-safe bowl. Stir in milk, water, and vanilla extract until smooth. Cook in the microwave at 1-minute intervals, stirring after interval, until mochiko mixture turns gelatinous, about 5 minutes. Dust a loaf pan with 1 tablespoon kinako; pour in mochiko mixture. Refrigerate until set, about 1 hour. Cut loaf into 16 pieces. Dust pieces with remaining 1 tablespoon kinako.
