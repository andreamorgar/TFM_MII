Beat in the eggs and milk and mix until well combined. Sift flour, baking powder and baking soda together. Add to the shortening mixture and blend until combined. Drop dough by teaspoonfuls onto the baking sheets and flatten with a glass. Sprinkle tops with sugar. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 8 to 12 minutes. Enjoy!
