Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Cut French bread loaf in half lengthwise and spread butter on both cut sides. Sprinkle each side with 2 teaspoons garlic powder. Place halves on prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until butter has melted and bread is hot but not toasted, about 5 minutes. Remove bread from oven. Turn on oven's broiler. Spread half the bottle of blue cheese salad dressing over each half; sprinkle each piece of bread with mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese. Broil until mozzarella cheese has melted and is slightly browned, 1 to 4 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent burning. Let bread cool 2 to 3 minutes before cutting into serving pieces.
