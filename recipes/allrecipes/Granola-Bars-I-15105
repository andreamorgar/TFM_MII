Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan. In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, sugar, vanilla and cinnamon until light. Combine the oats, bran and baking powder, stir into the butter mixture. Press evenly into the prepared baking pan. Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool, and cut into bars.
