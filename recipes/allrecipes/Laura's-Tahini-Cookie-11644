Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet. In a medium bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Stir in the egg, then add the tahini and honey, mixing until well blended. Sift together the flour, cinnamon, and cloves, and stir them into the creamed mixture. Drop dough 1 tablespoon at a time onto the prepared cookie sheet. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove and cool on wire racks.
