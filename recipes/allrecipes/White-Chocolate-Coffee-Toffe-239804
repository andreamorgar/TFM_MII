Butter a baking sheet and line the baking sheet with waxed paper. Melt white chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Stir in toffee bits, chocolate-covered toffee bits, and coffee. Remove from heat and spread into prepared baking dish. Refrigerate until hardened, about 1 hour; break into pieces.
