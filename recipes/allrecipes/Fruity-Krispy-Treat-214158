Spray an 8x10-inch pan with cooking spray. In a large saucepan over low heat, melt the butter. Gently stir the marshmallows into the butter, and allow to fully melt. Stir until the butter and marshmallows are blended, remove pan from heat, and stir in the breakfast cereal until the cereal is completely coated with the melted marshmallows. Spread the mixture out into the prepared pan, refrigerate for 1 hour to set, and cut into bars.
