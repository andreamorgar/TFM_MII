Place the potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender when pierced with a fork, about 20 minutes. Drain, and cool. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp. Drain, cool, and crumble. Slice the potatoes into 1/4 inch rounds, and arrange them in a single layer on the baking sheet. Sprinkle a few crumbles of bacon onto each round, then top with some shredded Cheddar cheese. Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheese is melted and lightly browned.
