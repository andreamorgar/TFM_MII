Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Whisk flaxseed meal, coconut flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Stir peanut butter, applesauce, eggs, butter, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; mix into flaxseed meal mixture until dough is just mixed. Spoon dough onto a baking sheet, pressing a wet fork into each cookie to flatten. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes.
