Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat cream cheese, sweetened condensed milk, sweetener, 1 cup coconut, milk, 1/4 cup pecans, eggs, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl until smooth; pour into prepared crust. Bake in preheated oven until filling is set and browned slightly around the edges, 35 to 40 minutes. Refrigerate cheesecake 8 hours to overnight. Spread crushed pineapple evenly over cheesecake and top with whipped topping. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons coconut and 1 tablespoon pecans over the whipped topping.
