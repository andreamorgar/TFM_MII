Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together the butter and peanut butter until smooth. Mix in the honey, egg and vanilla. Combine the whole wheat flour, dry milk powder, wheat bran and baking soda; stir into the peanut butter mixture. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges begin to brown. Remove from baking sheet to cool on wire racks.
