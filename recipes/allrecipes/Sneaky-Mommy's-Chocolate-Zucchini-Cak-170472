Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, cinnamon, baking powder, and cloves in a bowl; set aside. Beat together the eggs, sugar, applesauce, vegetable oil, apple juice concentrate, and vanilla extract in a mixing bowl until smooth. Stir in the dry mixture alternately with the milk, then add the zucchini, carrot, raisins, and dates; stir until just moistened. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Cool in the pan set over a wire rack.
