In a saucepan, combine 20 fun size candy bars, half-and-half, peanut butter and chocolate fudge topping. Heat on low until candy is melted and mixture is smooth. Remove from heat and fold in the whipped topping. Pour into crust and freeze overnight. Garnish frozen pie with additional whipped topping and chopped candy, and drizzle with chocolate syrup.
