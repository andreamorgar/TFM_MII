Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread diced apples into the bottom of a 9-inch square baking dish. Stir brown sugar, oats, flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Mash softened butter into the sugar mixture with a fork until you get a crumbly consistency; spread over apples to cover. Bake in preheated oven until the apples are tender, about 30 minutes.
