Preheat a lightly greased griddle over medium low heat. In a large bowl, mix quick cooking oats, flour, whole wheat flour, brown sugar, baking powder, dry milk powder, salt, cinnamon and cream of tartar. In a small bowl, beat together vegetable oil and eggs. Pour into the oats mixture, alternating with water, and mix thoroughly, creating a batter. Pour batter, 1/4 cup at a time, onto the prepared griddle. Cook on both sides until golden brown, flipping when the surface begins to bubble.
