Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a saucepan, combine ketchup, brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce; heat just to boiling. Pour sauce over bacon and water chestnuts. Cut bacon slices into thirds. Cut some of the bigger water chestnuts in half. Wrap chestnuts in bacon and secure with toothpicks; place in a 9x13 pan. Bake in preheated oven until bacon is completely cooked, about 45 to 50 minutes.
