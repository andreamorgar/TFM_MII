Place eggs into a large saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Cook for 15 minutes, and cool the eggs under a stream of cold water in the sink, 10 to 15 minutes. Peel the eggs and slice in half lengthwise. Scoop the egg yolks into a bowl, and mash them with a fork. Mix in the ranch dressing, creamy salad dressing, pickle relish, yellow mustard, celery seed, and black pepper until thoroughly combined. Spoon the filling into the egg white halves. Sprinkle each egg half with a pinch of paprika.
