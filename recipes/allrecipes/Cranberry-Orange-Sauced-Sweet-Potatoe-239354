Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Wash sweet potatoes; pat dry. Prick with a fork; place in a shallow baking dish. Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until soft. During the last 10 minutes of baking, prepare sauce. Melt shortening in medium saucepan (or place oil in saucepan). Add brown sugar, salt, orange juice and water, stirring over low heat until sugar dissolves. Add cranberries; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, covered, 5 minutes or until cranberries start to pop. Stir cornstarch mixture into cranberries; cook, stirring constantly, until sauce comes to a boil. Reduce heat and cook 1 to 2 minutes or until mixture is slightly thickened. Make a lengthwise cut in the center of each potato; press open from bottom. Place sweet potatoes on serving platter. Top each with cranberry sauce.
