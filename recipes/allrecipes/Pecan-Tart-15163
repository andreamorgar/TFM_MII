Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease 8 3-inch tart tins. Roll out pastry and cut 8 5-inch circles. Fit pastry circles into greased tart tins. In a large bowl, combine eggs, sugar, butter or margarine, corn syrup, and vanilla extract. Mix well, then stir in pecans. Pour an equal amount of mixture into each pastry-lined tart tin. Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes until pastry is golden brown and filling is set.
