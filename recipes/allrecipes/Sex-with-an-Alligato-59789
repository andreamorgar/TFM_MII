In a cocktail shaker full of ice, combine pineapple juice, melon liqueur, and coconut rum. Shake vigorously and strain into a rocks glass. Pour in the raspberry liqueur and let it sink to the bottom, then float the Jagermeister on top. If done correctly, you should have a brown layer on the top and bottom and green in the middle.
