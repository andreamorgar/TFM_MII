Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add noodles and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain, and transfer to a serving dish. While the pasta is cooking, mix together the yogurt and garlic in a medium bowl. Cover, and refrigerate until serving. In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef with the onion. Season with cinnamon while cooking. Drain off excess grease, and stir in lemon juice and salt. Adjust seasoning to taste. Toss the meat mixture with noodles, and serve hot with cold yogurt sauce spooned over.
