Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Sift together the flour, salt and baking soda, set aside. In a medium bowl, cream together the shortening and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Stir in the sifted ingredients until well blended. Roll dough in to 3/4 inch balls or tiny crescents. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheet. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
