Pour vodka into a plastic or glass bowl with a tight-fitting lid and stir in chilies with their sauce. Save the empty vodka bottle. Store vodka mixture in refrigerator for 4 weeks, shaking or stirring once per day. Strain through several layers of cheesecloth and pour back into the vodka bottle using a funnel. Seal the bottle and store the flavored vodka in the freezer.
