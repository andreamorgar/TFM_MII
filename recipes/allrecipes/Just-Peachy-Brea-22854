Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9x5 inch loaf pans. Place peaches, peach juice and 6 tablespoons sugar in a blender; puree until smooth. In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and 1 1/2 cups sugar. Stir in the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition, then stir in the vanilla. Blend this mixture into the flour mixture, alternately with the peach puree; stir just to combine. Fold in the nuts. Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake at 325 degrees for 55 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a loaf comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes in pans; turn out on rack and let cool completely.
