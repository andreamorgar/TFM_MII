Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Empty the packages of cake mix into a large bowl. Add eggs and whipped topping, and mix until well blended. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls and roll the balls in confectioners' sugar. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto an ungreased baking sheet and flatten slightly to keep them from rolling off. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
