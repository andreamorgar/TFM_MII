Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the anise seed and mix well. In a separate large bowl cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in one egg, and then the other. Beat for 1 minute. Beginning with the flour mixture, alternately add the milk and flour to the large bowl with the creamed butter and sugar. Mix until all ingredients are incorporated. Spoon batter into a greased 9x5x3 inch loaf pan. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven for 50 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting onto a cooling rack. May be stored in the refrigerator for up to 10 days.
