In a small bowl, whisk together honey mustard dressing, ground cumin, and curry powder. Cover, and refrigerate until serving. In a baking dish, whisk together yogurt, garam masala, and lemon juice. Place chicken breasts in the dish, and turn to coat. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, turning occasionally. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Lightly brush oil over grill grate. Grill chicken until done, about 6 to 8 minutes per side. In a small bowl, mix together onion, raisins, almonds, and pineapple. In a large bowl, toss salad greens with salad dressing and 3/4 of the almond mixture. Divide salad among 4 plates. Sprinkle equal amounts of reserved almond mixture over each salad. Top each with grilled chicken, and garnish with a mint sprig and a lime wedge.
