Cake: Combine sugar, eggs, oil and vanilla in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until combined. Combine flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl. Add to liquid ingredients; beat until combined. Stir in pineapple, carrots, walnuts and raisins. Pour batter into a greased 12-cup (3 L) Bundt pan or 13 x 9-inch (33 x 23 cm) baking pan. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) oven until a cake tester inserted in the centre comes out clean (about 60 to 65 minutes for Bundt pan or 45 to 50 minutes for 13 x 9-inch (33 x 23 cm) baking pan). Let cake cool before icing. Icing: Combine cream cheese, butter, vanilla and icing sugar in a bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Thin with a little milk, adding 1 tbsp for spreading or about 4 tbsp (60 mL) for drizzling over cake.
