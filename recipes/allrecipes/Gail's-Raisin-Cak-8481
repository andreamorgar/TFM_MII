Remove from heat and add butter, sugar and brown sugar. Stir to mix and allow to cool. In a large bowl, mix the flour, salt, cinnamon and baking soda. Add the raisin mixture and the nuts. Stir together until smooth. Pour batter into a 9x13 inch pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.
