In a large saucepan over medium high heat, saute the ground beef and the onions about 5 minutes, or until the onions are almost tender. Drain the fat. Add the pureed tomatoes, kidney beans, potatoes, chili powder, salt and water. Reduce heat to low and simmer about 30 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. Add another cup of water if a thinner chili is desired.
