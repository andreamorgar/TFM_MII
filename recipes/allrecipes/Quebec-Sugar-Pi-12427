Line a 9 inch pie plate with pastry. Trim and flute, but do not prick bottom. Combine the brown sugar and cream in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over low heat. Cook stirring slowly for 10 minutes, or until thickened. Remove from heat, and stir in 1/2 chopped nuts. Cool. Pour filling into prepared pie shell. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 to 35 minutes. Remove pie from oven, and cool. Filling will set when cold.
