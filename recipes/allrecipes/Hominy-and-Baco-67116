Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain grease from the skillet. Crumble the bacon, and return it to the skillet. Reduce heat to medium, and add hominy and evaporated milk, and cook, stirring often. Let it bubble, but don't let the milk scorch. Cook until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.
