Blend Chocolate Peanut Butter Swirl Frozen Dessert and all other ingredients together until smooth. Pour into serving glasses. Top with another dollop of CocoWhip. Drizzle with warmed organic peanut butter and Jen's Zen Chocolate Sauce. Sprinkle with chopped, roasted peanuts. If you're in a sharing mood, this makes about 2 12-oz shakes!
