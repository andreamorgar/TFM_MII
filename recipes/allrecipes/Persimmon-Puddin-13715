Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. In a mixing bowl, combine persimmon pulp, baking soda, sugar and eggs. Mix well. Add flour, baking powder, cinnamon, vanilla, salt, milk and melted butter. Stir to combine. Pour into baking pan and bake in preheated oven for 55 minutes. The pudding will rise but will fall when removed from oven.
