Place the dates, peanut butter, coconut, cocoa powder and salt into a food processor. Cover, and blend until smooth, about 4 minutes. The mixture will be very sticky. Press the mixture into a loaf pan lined with waxed paper. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Remove the chilled mixture from the pan and slice into 6 bars. Wrap each bar in foil and refrigerate until serving.
