In a saucepan, bring water to a boil. Add beans; cover and cook for 3 minutes. Drain and set aside. Cut bacon in half lengthwise; place on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave on high for 2-1/2 to 3 minutes or until edges curl. Place four or five beans on each bacon strip; wrap bacon around beans and tie in a knot. Place bundles in an 8-in. square baking dish. Drizzle with salad dressing. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or until beans are crisp-tender. Broil 4 in. from the heat for 2-3 minutes or until bacon is crisp.
