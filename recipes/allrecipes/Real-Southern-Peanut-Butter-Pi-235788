Stir confectioners' sugar and peanut butter together in a bowl until crumbly. Remove 2 tablespoons peanut butter mixture to a small bowl and reserve as a garnish. Spread remaining peanut butter mixture into the bottom of the pie crust. Whisk milk, white sugar, flour, egg yolks, and salt together in a saucepan over medium heat until mixture begins to bubble and thicken, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in butter and vanilla. Pour milk mixture over peanut butter mixture and cool pie completely in refrigerator, at least 2 hours. Spread whipped topping over chilled pie and sprinkle reserved 2 tablespoons peanut butter mixture over the top.
