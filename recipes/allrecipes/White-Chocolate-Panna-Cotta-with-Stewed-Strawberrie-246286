Combine white chocolate, heavy cream, 1 tablespoon sugar, and vanilla bean paste in a saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until chocolate has melted and mixture is smooth, 5 to 7 minutes. Place boiling water in a small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin powder over water and stir until dissolved. Stir gelatin mixture into white chocolate mixture until smooth. Ladle white chocolate mixture into six 1/2-cup ramekins. Cover with plastic wrap and chill until set, about 4 hours. Combine strawberries, orange juice, and 2 teaspoons white sugar in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered, until strawberries have softened and mixture has a syrupy consistency, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat, cover, and refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes. Spoon some stewed strawberries over each ramekin to serve.
