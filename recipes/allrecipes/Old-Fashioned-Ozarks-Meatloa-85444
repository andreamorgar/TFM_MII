Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, sausage, eggs, 1/2 cup of ketchup and bread crumbs until well blended. Pat into a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Bake for 1 hour and 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Drain off some of the fat once in a while to keep spattering to a minimum. Enjoy!
