Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Set butter in the middle of an 8-inch baking pan. Heat butter in the pan in the preheated oven until butter melts, about 2 minutes. Whisk flour, sugar, walnuts, oats, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Add milk and vanilla; stir well to create a batter. Pour batter into baking pan over melted butter. Place sliced plums over batter into baking pan. Sprinkle top with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Bake in the preheated oven until batter browns, fruit bubbles, and a knife inserted into the batter comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool to room temperature.
