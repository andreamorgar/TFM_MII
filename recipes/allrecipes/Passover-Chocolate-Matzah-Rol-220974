Cut a 12-inch long piece of waxed paper and set aside. Place crushed matzo sheets in a bowl. Sprinkle with red wine and water; mix well. Melt chocolate chips and sugar in a pot over low heat, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Thin with a spoonful of water if it becomes too thick. Remove from heat. Beat butter in a separate bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy. Gradually beat chocolate mixture into butter until well blended. Stir matzo mixture into chocolate-butter mixture with a wooden spoon. Pour mixture lengthwise on prepared waxed paper. Fold waxed paper around mixture to shape into a log. Fold paper at ends to enclose the roll. Freeze the roll until solid, at least 2 hours. Cut into slices.
