Separate each cookie, leaving all the creme filling on one half of each. Set filling-topped halves aside. Use small amount of melted chocolate to attach 5 candy corn pieces, pointed-sides down, to each plain cookie half for the turkey's tail. Refrigerate 5 minutes or until chocolate is firm. Attach malted milk ball to center of each filling-topped cookie half with melted chocolate for the turkey's body. Use additional melted chocolate to attach cinnamon candies to bodies for the heads. Attach turkey tails to bodies with remaining melted chocolate. Refrigerate until firm.
