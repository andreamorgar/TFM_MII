Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press each pie crust into 2 pie plates. Blend butternut squash, eggs, brown sugar, milk, cream, flour, butter, cinnamon, salt, ginger, vanilla extract, nutmeg, and cloves in a blender until smooth; pour into pie crusts. Bake in the preheated oven until pies are set in the middle, 35 to 40 minutes.
