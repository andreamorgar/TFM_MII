Preheat broiler and lightly oil rack of a broiler pan. Stack tortillas and wrap in foil. Stir together hoisin, soy, honey, ginger, vinegar, garlic, and cayenne in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart saucepan. Toss chicken with 3 tablespoons sauce in a large bowl to coat, then broil 2 to 3 inches from heat, without turning, rotating pan halfway through broiling, until cooked through and deep golden, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let stand, uncovered, 5 minutes. While chicken is broiling, put tortillas on bottom rack of oven to warm. Boil sauce until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes, then add plum and simmer, stirring, 2 minutes. Cut chicken crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. To eat, wrap up chicken, plum sauce, and scallions in tortillas.
