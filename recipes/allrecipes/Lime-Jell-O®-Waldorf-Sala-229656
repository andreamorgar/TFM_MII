Dissolve lime gelatin in boiling water in a bowl; stir cold water into gelatin. Pour gelatin into a mold. Stir apples, celery, and walnuts into gelatin. Refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours. Dip mold into hot water to loosen salad; place a plate on top of the mold and invert to release salad from mold.
