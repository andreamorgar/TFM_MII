Place pork in a medium skillet. Cook over medium heat until evenly brown. Drain and set aside. In a crockpot or slow cooker over medium heat, combine the processed cheese food, diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, cream of mushroom soup, chili and cooked pork. Heat until all the cheese is melted. Serve with tortilla chips.
