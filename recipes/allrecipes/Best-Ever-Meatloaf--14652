Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine meat, tomato juice, oats, egg, chopped onion, salt and pepper. Mix lightly but thoroughly. Press into 8x4 inch loaf pan. Bake for 1 hour, or until meat is no longer pink and juices run clear. Drain. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
