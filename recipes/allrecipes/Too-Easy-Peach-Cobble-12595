Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter an 8-inch square baking dish. Cut crust from bread slices, and cut each into 4 or 5 strips. Spread fruit into prepared pan, and cover with a layer of bread strips. Beat together butter, sugar, and flour; mix in egg. Pour mixture over the fruit and bread. Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 45 minutes, or until golden brown.
