Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the sugar and cook until bubbling, about 1 minute. Add the graham cracker crumbs; stir until the color deepens, about 3 minutes. Turn out onto a plate to cool. Combine the condensed milk and cranberry sauce in a mixing bowl, blend together with a hand mixer until the mixture thickens. Place the whipping cream in a separate bowl and beat with an electric mixer until firm peaks form; fold into the cranberry mixture. Layer 1/4 cup of the cranberry mixture into each of six (8 ounce) wine goblets or glasses; top each with 1 tablespoon of the crumbs. Repeat layering. Refrigerate at least 1 hour, up to 4 hours.
