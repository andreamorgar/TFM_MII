In 10-inch skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Cook onion in butter 4 to 6 minutes, stirring frequently, just until tender. Stir in all remaining ingredients except turkey and potato chips. Heat to boiling. Reduce heat; cover and simmer 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add turkey. Cover and continue to cook 5 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender. Sprinkle with potato chips.
