Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place butter in a 9x13-inch baking dish and place in the preheating oven until melted, about 5 minutes. Beat milk, flour, eggs, sugar, and salt together in a bowl until batter is smooth. Pour melted butter from baking dish into batter and beat until smooth. Pour batter into the baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes.
