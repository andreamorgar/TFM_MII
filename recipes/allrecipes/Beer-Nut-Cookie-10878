Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cream the shortening and the sugar until light. Add the eggs (room temperature) and the vanilla and mix well. Combine the flour, salt, and baking soda. Add this to the creamed mixture. Stir in the nuts. Drop about 2 teaspoons per each cookies onto greased cookie sheets. Bake for about 11 minutes, or until firm. Cool for about 3 minutes on the sheet and then remove to cool.
