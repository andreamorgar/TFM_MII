In a microwave, melt chocolate; cool for 10 minutes. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside. In a mixing bowl, beat the egg and sugar. Beat in the water and oil. Stir in melted chocolate and dry ingredients; mix until blended. Pour into a greased 8-in. square baking pan. Sprinkle with chocolate chips. Bake at 350 degrees F for 32-38 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
