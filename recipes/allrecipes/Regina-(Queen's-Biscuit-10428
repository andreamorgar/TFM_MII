Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheet. Sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cardamom in a large bowl. Cut shortening in with a pastry blender or knives until the size of small peas. Stir in eggs, lightly beaten, and lemon extract. Stir in milk on tablespoon at a time, mixing after each addition. Mix everything together thoroughly. Break dough off in small pieces and roll in the hands to rolls about 1-1/2 inches long. Flatten slightly and roll in sesame seeds. Place on cookie sheet 3/4 inch apart. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until lightly browned.
