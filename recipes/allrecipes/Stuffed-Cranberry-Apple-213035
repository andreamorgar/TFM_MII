Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix the sour cream, cranberries, brown sugar, and orange zest together and set aside. Slice each pie crust into three strips. Wrap each cored apple with one strip of pastry, covering the bottom of the apple, but leaving the top open. Fill each apple with the prepared filling. Place the wrapped and filled apples into a baking dish. Bake the apples in the preheated oven until the pastry is evenly browned and the apples are tender, about 30 minutes. Let the apples stand at room temperature for 10 minutes before serving.
