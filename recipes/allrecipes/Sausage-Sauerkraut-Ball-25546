Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place ground pork sausage and onion in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and stir in all-purpose flour, dry mustard and hot pepper sauce. Whisk in milk. Stirring constantly, continue cooking approximately 5 minutes. Remove from heat and mix in dried parsley and sauerkraut. Place butter in a 9x13 inch baking dish, and melt in the preheated oven. In a small bowl, stir together the eggs and cold water. Roll the sausage mixture into 1 inch balls. Dip sausage balls into the egg and water mixture, then roll them in the bread crumbs. Arrange coated sausage balls in the baking dish in a single layer. Bake in the preheated oven approximately 30 minutes, turning after 15 minutes, until golden brown.
