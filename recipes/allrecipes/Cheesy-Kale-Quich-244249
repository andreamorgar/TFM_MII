Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Press pie crust into a pie plate. Place cream cheese in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until warmed, about 10 seconds. Stir cream cheese and milk together in a bowl; stir into beaten eggs. Stir Cheddar cheese into egg mixture; add kale and bacon. Pour egg mixture into the pie crust. Bake in the preheated oven until top has golden brown spots and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
