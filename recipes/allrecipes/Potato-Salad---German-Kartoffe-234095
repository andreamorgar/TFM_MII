Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes; drain and rinse with cold water to cool. Remove and discard potato skins. Slice potatoes. Whisk vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl; add potatoes, onion, and chopped gherkin. Stir salad dressing into the mixture. Fold 3/4 the egg wedges into the mixture. Garnish with the remaining egg wedges and parsley. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 hour before serving.
