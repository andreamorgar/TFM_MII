Put the butter or margarine, molasses, sugar, and chocolate into a 1-1/2 quart oven-proof glass bowl and microwave on high for two minutes or until fat and chocolate have melted. Stir well. Add the broken cookies or wafers, raisins, almonds, and cherries. Mix well to coat them with the chocolate mixture. Place a 7 inch plain flan ring on a flat serving plate. Spoon in the cookie mixture. Press down evenly. Chill in refrigerator for about 8 hours or overnight. Remove flan ring and serve.
