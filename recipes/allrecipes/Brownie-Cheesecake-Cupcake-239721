Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners. Mix brownie mix, oil, eggs, and water together in a bowl until well combined. Mix cream cheese, sugar, butter, flour, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Fill each muffin cup 1/2-full with brownie mix; top with cream cheese mixture. Spoon brownie mix over cream cheese mixture layer. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the brownie part comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
