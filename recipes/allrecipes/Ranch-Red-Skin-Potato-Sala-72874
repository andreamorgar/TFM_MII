Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and refrigerate until cold, then cut into bite-size pieces. While the potatoes simmer, cook the bacon. Place the bacon in a large skillet; cook over medium-high heat until brown and crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate; crumble. Combine the cooked potatoes, crumbled bacon, Cheddar cheese, and green onions in a large bowl. Fold in the ranch dip. Refrigerate overnight.
