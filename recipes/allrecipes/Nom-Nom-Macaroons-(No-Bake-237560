Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix oats, almonds, wheat germ, and coconut together in a bowl. Combine sugar, butter, milk, and cocoa powder together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Cook and stir cocoa mixture until smooth, about 5 minutes. Pour cocoa mixture over oat mixture; stir to coat. Drop oat mixture, about 1 tablespoon per cookie, onto the prepared baking sheet. Chill in the refrigerator until set, 20 to 30 minutes.
