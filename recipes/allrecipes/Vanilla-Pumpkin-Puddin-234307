Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix pumpkin, sugar, butter, French vanilla-flavored coffee creamer, eggs, salt, cinnamon, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until evenly combined; pour into an 8x8-inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until pudding is set, about 40 minutes.
