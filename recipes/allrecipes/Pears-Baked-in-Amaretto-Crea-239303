Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch baking dish with 1 tablespoon butter. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon sugar into buttered dish. Rub remaining butter onto cut sides of pear halves. Arrange pears into the prepared baking dish with the cut sides down. Sprinkle remaining sugar over the pears. Stir cream and amaretto together in a bowl. Bake pears in preheated oven for 10 minutes. Pour cream mixture over the pears and continue baking until the pears are tender, about 15 minutes more.
