Continue beating and pour in sugar, a few tablespoons at a time, until mixture is glossy and stiff peaks form. Fold in vanilla. Place in greased pie plate or spoon or pipe onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Place in preheated oven and turn oven off. Leave meringue in unopened oven 8 hours or overnight.
