Place strawberries, sugar, and water into blender and blend until the mixture is smooth. Pour mixture into a 9x13-inch baking pan; stir in the wine. Freeze, stirring once about halfway through, until mixture is slushy, 4 1/2 to 5 hours. Remove from freezer and stir to breakup the larger frozen clumps.
