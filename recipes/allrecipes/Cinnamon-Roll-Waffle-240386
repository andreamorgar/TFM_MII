Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Whisk flour, white sugar, baking powder, and 1 teaspoon salt together in a large bowl. Beat warm milk, 1/3 cup melted butter, eggs, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract together in another bowl. Add milk mixture to flour mixture and stir until batter is lumpy and just-moistened. Working in batches, ladle batter into preheated waffle iron and cook until waffles are golden and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir brown sugar, 1/2 cup melted butter, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Beat confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, 1/4 cup softened butter, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, and 1/8 teaspoon salt together in another bowl. Place waffles on a plate and drizzle cinnamon mixture and cream cheese mixture over the top.
