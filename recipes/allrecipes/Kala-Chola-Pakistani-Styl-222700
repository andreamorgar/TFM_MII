Place garbanzo beans in a large bowl. Pour enough water over the beans to cover by several inches. Soak 8 hours to overnight. Rinse and drain the garbanzo beans thoroughly. Combine garbanzo beans, 3 cups water, tomatoes, 1 finely chopped onion, jalapeno pepper, vegetable oil, salt, turmeric, ground red chile pepper, and dried whole chiles in a large pot over medium-high heat; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the garbanzo beans are tender, 3 to 4 hours, adding water as needed to keep about 1 inch of liquid at the bottom of the pot. Garnish with cilantro and 1 tablespoon finely chopped onion to serve.
