Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Arrange crackers on the prepared baking sheet; top each with a peanut butter cup. Place in the preheated oven for 2 minutes. Remove from oven and quickly place chocolate-covered peanuts on top while peanut butter cup is still warm. Cool for 5 minutes.
