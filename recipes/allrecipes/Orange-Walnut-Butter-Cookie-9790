Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease cookie sheet. Beat butter until smooth. Add sugar and mix until fluffy. Mix in orange concentrate, orange peel and vanilla. Add flour and mix until dough comes together. Form 1 rounded tablespoon of dough into a ball. Place on prepared cookie sheet and flatten to a 2-inch round. Repeat with the remaining dough. Press 1 walnut half firmly onto each round. Bake about 12 minutes or until cookies just begin to brown. Remove to a rack and cool.
