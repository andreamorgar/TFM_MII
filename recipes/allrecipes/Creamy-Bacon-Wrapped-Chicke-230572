Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix cream cheese and green onions in a bowl; season with salt and black pepper. Spread about 1/4 cup of cream cheese mixture over each chicken breast. Starting at the narrow end, roll chicken breasts over filling. Wrap each chicken breast in 4 slices of bacon. Set wrapped chicken on a rack set in a baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is browned and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast reads 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 1 hour.
