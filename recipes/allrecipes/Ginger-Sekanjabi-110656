Boil the sugar and water together in a large saucepan over high heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, and stir in the vinegar and minced ginger. Allow mixture to cool to room temperature, then strain out the minced ginger with a fine sieve. Store at room temperature in a sterile container. To use, stir 1 part syrup into 4 to 5 parts water; serve cold with ice if desired.
