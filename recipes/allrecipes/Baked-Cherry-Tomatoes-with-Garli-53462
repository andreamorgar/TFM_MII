Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut a slit in one side of the cherry tomatoes, and insert a sliver of garlic into each. Arrange tomatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Bake tomatoes about 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until slightly shriveled. Serve warm.
