Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk the honey and wing sauce together until smooth; set aside. Season the flour to taste with salt and pepper; whisk, and set aside. Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl until smooth; stir in the pheasant strips. Remove the pheasant strips from the egg, and gently press into the flour to coat; shake off the excess flour. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the pheasant strips on each side until golden brown and crispy, about 3 minutes per side. toss the pheasant strips in the wing sauce, and pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the pheasant has absorbed the sauce, about 20 minutes.
