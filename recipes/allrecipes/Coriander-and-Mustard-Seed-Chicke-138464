Pat chicken dry and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking, then brown chicken well, about 4 minutes on each side. Transfer with tongs to a plate. Add shallots to skillet and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until golden, about 2 minutes. Stir in mustard and coriander seeds, wine, and water and bring to a boil. Return chicken, skin sides up, to skillet and simmer, covered, until chicken is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer chicken to a platter. Add jelly and cilantro to sauce, stirring until jelly is melted. Season sauce with salt and pepper and spoon over chicken.
