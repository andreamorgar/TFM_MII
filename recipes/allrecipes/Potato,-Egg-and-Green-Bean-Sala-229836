In a large saucepan, cover potatoes with cold salted water and bring to a boil. Cook until tender, about 10 minutes, adding beans in the last 4 or 5 minutes of cooking. When vegetables are tender, drain. Place in a large bowl; toss with 2 tbsp olive oil. Add eggs. Combine remaining 3 tbsp olive oil, vinegar, mustard, garlic, salt and pepper. Drizzle vinaigrette over vegetables and eggs; toss gently to combine. Adjust seasonings, if necessary. Serve warm.
