Combine honey, coconut oil, and cocoa powder in a small pot and bring to a boil; cook at a boil for 2 minutes and remove from heat. Stir oats, peanut butter, coconut, and vanilla extract into the hot honey mixture until the peanut butter melts and the mixture is smooth. Drop mixture by spoonful onto waxed paper. Set aside to cool until firm, about 20 minutes.
