Boil noodles in boiling salted water just until softened; do not cook through. Rinse, and drain. Beat the egg substitute with the melted butter. Mix in SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, crushed pineapple with juice, vanilla, and cinnamon. Stir in the noodles. Spread into a greased 9x13 inch baking pan. Arrange pineapple rings decoratively over the top. Place a cherry in the center of each ring if desired. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 minutes, or until golden.
