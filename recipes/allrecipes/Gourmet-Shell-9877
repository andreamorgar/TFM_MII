Heat mold by letting sit in hot oil. Remove mold and let excess shortening drain off. Dip mold into batter. Do not go over the top. Hold in the hot oil about 45 seconds or until lightly browned. Remove and drain on paper towels or brown bags. Dust with confectioners sugar if desired. When you make the first one it's usually a waste cookie because it sticks. But after that they usually fall off the mold as they're cooking, just scoop out with a slotted spoon.
