Melt 4.5 ounces of the semi-sweet chocolate in a double boiler until just fluid. Using a whisk, incorporate softened butter, then egg yolk, sifted sugar and cream into the melted chocolate. Whisk until smooth. Pour chocolate mixture in heart molds or any other molds (an egg poacher works well as a mold), and refrigerate until set, about 3 hours. Melt remaining 4 ounces of chocolate in a double boiler until just fluid. Unmold chocolate truffles and dip them in the melted chocolate, shake off excess chocolate and leave to set on parchment paper. Trim excess chocolate. In a small bowl, combine liqueur and gold dust to achieve a paint-like consistency. Using brushes, decorate hearts with gold "paint" A simple "I love You" is quite effective, or better still use an original romantic quote. If you are very artistic, birds, or a floral motif along the edges complete the effect.
