Stir together the vanilla ice cream and hot pepper sauce in a medium bowl. Place in the freezer until firm. Melt butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Stir in the sugar until dissolved, then add the strawberries. Cook, stirring occasionally until the strawberries are hot. Pour the vodka over the berries, and carefully light with a match. Let the flames burn off, then remove the pan from the heat. Scoop the hot ice cream into two bowls, then divide the strawberry vodka sauce between them. Serve immediately.
