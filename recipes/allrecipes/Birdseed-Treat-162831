Toast the sesame and sunflower seeds in a dry, heavy skillet over medium heat until light brown and fragrant. Sesame seeds should crumble easily when rubbed between your fingers. Heat honey and peanut butter in a saucepan over low heat until warm; stir in the toasted seeds and flax seeds. Line an 11 x 7 inch dish with plastic wrap. Press the mixture into the bottom of the lined dish; allow to cool completely. Cut into 2-inch squares to serve.
