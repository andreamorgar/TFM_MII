Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cover cookie sheets with foil, and generously grease the foil. These cookies will be very sticky. In a medium bowl, stir together the sugar, rolled oats, and flour. Stir in the egg, melted butter, and vanilla. Stir in the coconut. The batter should be sticky and thick, but pull away from the sides of the bowl. Drop teaspoon sized amounts of dough onto the prepared cookie sheets, three inches apart, and a few inches from the sides of the pan. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. Wait until cookies are completely cooled before removing them from the baking sheet.
