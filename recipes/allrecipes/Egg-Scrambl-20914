Bring a small pot of salted water to a boil. Add potato and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and chop. Saute the onion and garlic in a lightly oiled skillet over medium high heat. When onion is soft, stir in the spinach and cook until wilted, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and pour in the eggs. Cook until the bottom has set, about 2 minutes. Stir in the potatoes and tomatoes; sprinkle on the salt, pepper, cayenne and hot sauce. Cook, stirring occasionally, until eggs have set. Sprinkle with grated cheese and serve warm.
