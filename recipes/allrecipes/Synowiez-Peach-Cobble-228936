Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Melt butter in a 9x13-inch baking dish in the preheating oven. Mix flour, sugar, and milk together in a large bowl; pour into baking dish with melted butter. Spread peaches over the batter and sprinkle with cinnamon. Bake in the preheated oven until cobbler is bubbling and lightly browned, about 45 minutes. Let cool about 15 minutes before serving.
