Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a bread pan. Mix flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, and cloves in a large bowl. Beat egg and milk together in a separate bowl; add to flour mixture and stir to moisten dry ingredients evenly. Pour mixture into a bread pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
