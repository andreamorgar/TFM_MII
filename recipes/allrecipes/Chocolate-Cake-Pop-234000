Preheat a cake pop maker and brush with oil. Whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl; beat in buttermilk, vegetable oil, egg, and vanilla extract with an electric mixer until smooth. Beat coffee into batter until evenly incorporated. Fill each reservoir of prepared cake pop maker with about 1 tablespoon batter. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of cake pop comes out clean, about 4 minutes; remove cake pops and allow to cool completely.
