Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat sugar, peanut butter, and butter or margarine till fluffy. Blend in water, egg, and vanilla. Combine oats, flour and baking soda and add to the mixture. Shape into balls 1 inch in size. Place on ungreased cookie sheet, and flatten with a glass dipped in sugar. Bake 8 to 10 minutes. Cool completely. In a saucepan over low-heat, melt chocolate and shortening, stir until smooth. Take 1/2 teaspoon and spread over each cookie, sprinkle with nuts. Chill until set.
