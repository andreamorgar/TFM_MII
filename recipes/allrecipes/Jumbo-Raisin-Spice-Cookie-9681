Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a large bowl, beat butter until soft. Mix in the vanilla and sugar. Add the eggs and mix well. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, ginger cinnamon and nutmeg. Gradually stir into the butter mixture. Stir in raisins and peanuts. Mixture will be stiff. Take tablespoon-sized pieces of dough and roll into a ball. Place onto cookie sheets and flatten slightly to 1/2 inch thickness. Bake for 15 to 18 minutes in the preheated oven. Let cool on wire racks.
