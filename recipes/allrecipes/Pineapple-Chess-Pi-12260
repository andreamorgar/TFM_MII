Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Mix the white sugar, cornmeal, eggs, melted butter, lemon juice, and the undrained crushed pineapple mixed with enough milk to make 3/4 cup. Do not over beat. Pour filling into one 9-inch unbaked pie shell. Bake pie at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until set and golden. This should take about 40 minutes. Serve pie at room temperature.
