In a bowl, mix together the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, and oat flour until thoroughly combined. In a separate bowl, stir together the yeast, warm water, and sugar until the sugar has dissolved, and let the yeast mixture stand until a layer of foam forms on the top, about 10 minutes. Pour the yeast mixture into the pan of a bread machine, and add the flour mixture on top of the yeast. Place the butter along one side of the pan, and spoon the salt on the other side of the pan (flour mixture is in center). Set the machine to the White Bread setting and Normal time, and turn on the machine. After baking, allow the bread to cool on rack before slicing.
