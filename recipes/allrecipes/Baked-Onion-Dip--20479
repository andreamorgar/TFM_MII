Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 2 quart baking dish with cooking spray. In a large mixing bowl, combine the mayonnaise, onions and cheese. Pour the mixture into the baking dish and bake for approximately 45 minutes, until the top is slightly brown. Serve hot with buttery, round crackers.
