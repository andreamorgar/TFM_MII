Beat eggs, coconut flour, coconut milk, honey, vanilla extract, nutmeg, and cinnamon together in a bowl until batter is smooth; let stand for 5 to 10 minutes. Grease a crepe pan with olive oil and place pan over low heat, wiping olive oil from pan with a paper towel. Pour about 1/4 cup batter into the pan and immediately tilt pan around until the batter evenly coats the bottom in a thin layer. Cook until the top of the crepe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, about 30 seconds. Run a spatula around the edge of the pan to loosen; flip crepe and cook until the other side has turned light brown. Repeat with remaining batter.
