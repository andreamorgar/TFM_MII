Melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat; saute onion, ham, and green bell pepper until onion and bell pepper are tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour eggs into ham-vegetable mixture; cook and stir until eggs are scrambled and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle Monterey Jack cheese over egg mixture; cook and stir until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve egg mixture in tortillas; top with salsa.
