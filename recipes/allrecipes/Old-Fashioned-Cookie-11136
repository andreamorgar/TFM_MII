Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two cookie sheets. Cream the sugar with the shortening and the butter or the margarine. Add the baking powder, eggs, milk and flour. Mix until combined. On a lightly floured surface roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thick and cut into desired shapes. Place cookies on the prepared cookie sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until lightly browned.
