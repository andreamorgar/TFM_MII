Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 inch pie pan. Pick through the crab meat and remove any bits of shell or cartilage. In a medium mixing bowl, combine crabmeat, bread crumbs, milk, eggs, parsley, lemon juice, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper and cayenne pepper. Transfer the quiche mixture to the prepared pan. Sprinkle paprika over the quiche. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until the quiche is firm in the center.
