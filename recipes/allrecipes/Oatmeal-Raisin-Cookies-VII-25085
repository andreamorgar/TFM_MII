Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a large bowl, cream together the margarine, fructose and egg whites until smooth. Stir in the applesauce, apple juice concentrate and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and, if desired, salt; stir into the applesauce mixture. Finally, mix in the oats and chopped raisins. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes in the preheated oven, until cookies are firm to the touch and lightly browned. Cool 1 minute on the cookie sheets before removing to wire racks to cool completely. When cool, store in an airtight container. I like to keep mine in the refrigerator.
