Line a 9 inch square pan with buttered wax paper. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine brown sugar, evaporated milk, butter and salt. Bring to a boil, and heat to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in marshmallow fluff, vanilla and chopped pecans.
