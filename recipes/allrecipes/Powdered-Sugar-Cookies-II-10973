Mix together the shortening, egg, and confectioners' sugar. Stir in vanilla, cream of tartar, salt, baking soda and flour. Mix well. Roll dough into 1 inch in diameter balls. Place on cookie sheet. Press down with a glass bottom dipped in sugar. ( I have also used cookie stamps dipped into sugar.) Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 10 minutes or just until edges are turning golden. Let cool slightly before removing from the cookie sheet.
