Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread peanuts on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake peanuts, stirring every 2 minutes, until golden brown and fragrant, 6 to 8 minutes. Combine peanuts, peanut oil, sugar, and salt in a food processor fitted with a metal blade; process until peanuts are chopped and the mixture forms a ball, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the food processor bowl; continue processing to desired consistency, 1 to 3 minutes more.
