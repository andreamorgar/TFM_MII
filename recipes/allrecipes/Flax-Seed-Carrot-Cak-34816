Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a 9x5 inch loaf pan with vegetable cooking spray. Whisk together the egg whites, sugar, milk, applesauce, vanilla, and almond extract in a small bowl; mix until well blended. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, whole wheat flour, flax seed, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and baking soda. Mix the egg into the flour; stir until well blended. Fold in the walnuts, raisins, carrot, and drained pineapple. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (but not necessarily dry), about 40 minutes. Set aside to cool for 10 to 20 minutes before refrigerating overnight.
