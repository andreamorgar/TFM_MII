Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Press pie crust dough into a pie pan. Poke small holes into dough with a fork. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Place cream cheese in a small microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave on High to soften, about 20 seconds. Spread softened cream cheese in the bottom of cooled crust. Layer 2 1/2 cups blueberries over the cream cheese. Whisk cornstarch and cold water in a small bowl until dissolved. Stir cornstarch mixture, 2 1/2 cups blueberries, sugar, and lemon zest in a saucepan over medium heat; simmer until thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour the thickened blueberry mixture over the raw blueberries in the pie crust and spread evenly. Cool pie in refrigerator until set, at least 1 hour.
