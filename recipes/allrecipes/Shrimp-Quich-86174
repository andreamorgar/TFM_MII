Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread shrimp evenly across the bottom of the pie crust. Sprinkle cheese over the shrimp. Stir sour cream, green onions, salt and pepper into the beaten eggs; then pour mixture evenly over the shrimp and cheese. Bake in a preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes. Serve warm or cold.
