Drain chestnuts and place them in a bowl. Cover chestnuts with teriyaki sauce and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours or more. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove water chestnuts from refrigerator and drain well. Cut bacon strips in half so that strips are about 3 inches long. Wrap each chestnut with bacon and secure bacon closed with a toothpick. Arrange all wrapped chestnuts on a baking sheet. Place in oven until bacon is crispy. Remove from oven and enjoy.
