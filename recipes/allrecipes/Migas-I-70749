Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Tear corn tortillas into bite size pieces, and fry them in the skillet, stirring constantly, until they are just starting to get crisp. Pour the eggs into the skillet with the tortillas, stirring until the egg is cooked through. Season with salt to taste. Serve immediately.
