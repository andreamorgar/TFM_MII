Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat, about 1 minute. Pour melted butter into a bowl. Add milk, egg, and honey; blend well. Stir in flour and cinnamon until batter is just combined. Drop spoonfuls of batter into the buttered skillet. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Squeeze lemon juice over pancakes. Sprinkle confectioners' sugar on top.
