In a large stainless steel pot, place pig's feet and enough water to cover. Boil feet 2 hours or until tender; drain. Rinse feet in hot water to remove excess fat. Remove as many bones as you can. Put 1 chili pepper and 3 pig's feet in each one quart jar. In a separate bowl, mix salt and vinegar together. Pour vinegar mixture over pig's feet to cover. Seal jars and refrigerate for at least 3 days to 1 week before eating.
