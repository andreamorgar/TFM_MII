Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut the flour into the butter until the size of peas. Mix in the sugar and spices. Add the sherry and stir well to make a dough. Roll out on a floured surface to about 1/4 inch thick. Cut into 3 inch rounds. Place onto greased baking sheets. Bake until firm but not colored, about 14 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
