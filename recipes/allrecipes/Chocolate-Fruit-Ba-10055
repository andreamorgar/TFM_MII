Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Stir flour, baking powder and salt together. Beat eggs until light; add sugar gradually, beating well after each addition. Stir in almond flavoring, then dry ingredients. Fold in chocolate pieces, fruits, and nuts. Spread dough evenly in greased 9 x 13 inch pan. Bake 30 to 35 minutes. If desired, when cooled, frost with powdered sugar icing. Cut into bars and garnish each bar with a chocolate piece.
