Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Spread bacon squares into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cook bacon under preheated broiler until brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Beat eggs, sugar, and salt together in a bowl; add milk and flour alternately while mixing with a spoon to make a thin batter. Pour batter into the hot baking dish with the bacon. Bake in preheated oven until puffy and brown, 20 to 30 minutes.
