Mix crushed cookies and butter together in a bowl. Press evenly into a 9-inch pie plate. Bake in the preheated oven until crisp, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Combine 1/2 cup dulce de leche, cream cheese, white sugar, and confectioners' sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Add 2 cups heavy cream and vanilla extract; beat until soft peaks form. Pour over the cooled crust; spread in an even layer with a spatula. Refrigerate pie until cream layer is set, at least 6 hours. Spread 1/2 cup dulce de leche evenly over the chilled cream layer. Mix toasted coconut with 3/4 cup dulce de leche in a bowl. Spoon over dulce de leche layer; press down gently with a spatula. Combine remaining 1/4 cup dulce de leche and 2 tablespoons heavy cream in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave for 20 seconds. Stir. Continue heating in 20-second intervals until melted and smooth, stirring after each interval. Combine chocolate chips and remaining 3 tablespoons heavy cream in a separate microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave for 20 seconds. Stir. Continue heating in 20-second intervals until melted and smooth, stirring after each interval. Drizzle melted caramel and chocolate over pie.
