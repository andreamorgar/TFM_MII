Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place butter in a 9x9-inch baking pan; melt in the preheating oven. Mix flour, sugar, and milk together in bowl until smooth. Open peaches and add almond extract to the peaches and juice. Pour peaches over melted butter in the 9x9-inch pan; spoon batter atop peaches without mixing. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and top is lightly browned, about 45 to 60 minutes.
