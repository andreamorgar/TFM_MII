Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a large casserole dish. In a skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef until evenly brown. Drain grease. Mix in garlic, and season with salt and pepper. Stir in spinach, and cook until heated through. Stir in the uncooked egg noodles, and transfer to the prepared casserole dish. Mix in cream of mushroom soup and milk, and sprinkle with cheese. Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly.
