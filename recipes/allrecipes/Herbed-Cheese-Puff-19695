Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet. In a medium bowl, mix together Parmesan cheese, Romano cheese, mayonnaise, basil, oregano, green onions and garlic. Separate each unbaked biscuit vertically into 3 pieces. Spread 1 tablespoon cheese mixture on each piece. Arrange pieces in a single layer on baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven 10 to 12 minutes, or until puffed and golden brown. Serve warm!
