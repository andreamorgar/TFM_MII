Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat, and saute garlic and onions until tender. In a small bowl, mix the flour, milk, and eggs. In a medium bowl, mix potatoes, garlic and onions, flour mixture, broccoli, mushrooms, Cheddar cheese, and chicken. Transfer to a medium baking dish. Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until eggs are no longer runny and top is lightly browned.
