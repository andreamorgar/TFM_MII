Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish. Pour boiling water over couscous in a bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let couscous soak until the water is completely absorbed, about 5 minutes. Slice the tops from tomatoes and take a very small slice of the bottoms so they will be stable upright. Use a spoon to remove and discard the tomato innards. Put tomatoes in the prepared baking dish. Bake tomatoes in the preheated oven until lightly charred at the edges, about 20 minutes. Line the inner walls of each tomato with 4 basil leaves. Toss mozzarella cheese with the couscous; stuff into tomatoes. Drizzle balsamic vinegar over the top of the stuffed tomatoes.
