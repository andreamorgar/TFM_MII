In a separate bowl, mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, nutmeg and cinnamon. Fold flour mixture into pumpkin mixture. Pour into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven 60 minutes; reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake 15 minutes more, until cake springs back when lightly touched in center. Let cool in pan 10 minutes before removing to wire rack to cool completely. To make the Honey Glaze: Warm honey in microwave or small saucepan until runny.
