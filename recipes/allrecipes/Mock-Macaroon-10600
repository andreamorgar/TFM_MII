Combine oatmeal, brown sugar and oil in a bowl. Stir to mix well. Cover and let stand at least 5 hours, or overnight. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets - use non-stick if possible. Add the egg, salt and almond extract to oatmeal and stir well until blended. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls about 1-1/2 inches apart on greased cookie sheets. Bake 7 or 8 minutes or until edges are browned and center is golden. Remove from cookie sheet and cool on racks.
