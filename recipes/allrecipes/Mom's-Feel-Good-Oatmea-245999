Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Add oats, flaxseed meal, and chia seeds, whisking well after each addition to prevent clumps. Add goji berries, raisins, cranberries, brown sugar, pumpkin seeds, and cinnamon. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until oatmeal reaches desired consistency, 40 to 45 minutes.
