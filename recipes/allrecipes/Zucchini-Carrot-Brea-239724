Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans. Mix flour, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, baking powder, nutmeg, and allspice together in a bowl. Beat sugar, applesauce, and eggs together in a separate bowl; mix into the flour mixture until batter is just combined. Fold zucchini and carrots into batter. Divide batter between the prepared loaf pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaves comes out clean, about 1 hour.
