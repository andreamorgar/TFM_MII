Preheat the grill for high heat. Oil the grill grate, and cook the eggplants on all sides until charred and black, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat, and place on a rack to cool. Peel, slice diagonally, and set aside. In a food processor or blender, combine the chile peppers, garlic, cilantro, onion, sugar, and lime juice. Process until smooth. Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat, and add the chile mixture. Reduce heat to medium, and cook for 1 minute. Gently stir in the tofu, 1/4 cup of basil, and the eggplant. Cook until heated through. Remove to a serving dish, and garnish with the remaining basil.
