In a medium bowl, use a spoon to stir together the confectioners' sugar and ricotta cheese until well blended. Fold in the almonds, cherries, and chocolate chips. Spoon into the graham cracker crust. Freeze for 3 hours to set. Remove from the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing and serving. Refreeze any leftovers.
