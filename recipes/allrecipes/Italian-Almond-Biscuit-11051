Combine the flour, eggs, margarine, sugar, vanilla, lemon zest and chopped almonds to form a smooth dough. Stir in the whole almonds. Divide dough into 3 equal parts and roll each portion out into a cylindrical log shape. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place refrigerated rolls of dough onto a greased baking sheet and bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool then slice into 1/2 inch thick slices. Put cookies onto greased baking sheet and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. The cookies are very crisp when done.
