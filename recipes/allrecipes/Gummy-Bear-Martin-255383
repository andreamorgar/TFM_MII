Combine vodka and 1 bag of gummy bears in a pitcher. Let sit until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Discard gummy bears. Fill a cocktail shaker with ice; add 1/4 of the flavored vodka and 1/2 cup vegetable juice. Cover and shake until the outside of the shaker has frosted. Strain into a chilled glass and garnish with gummy bears from the second bag. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
