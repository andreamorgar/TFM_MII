Line a 13x9-inch baking pan with parchment paper. Bring sugar, butter, and evaporated milk to a boil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan, stirring constantly; cook and stir at a boil until mixture is smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat; stir white chocolate chips and marshmallow creme into the sugar mixture until completely melted. Add vanilla extract; stir. Gently fold 1/2 cup crumbled cookies into the white chocolate mixture until just incorporated; spread into the prepared pan. Sprinkle 1 cup crushed cookies evenly over the top. Press cookies lightly into the fudge. Cool at room temperature until set. Cut into small squares to serve.
