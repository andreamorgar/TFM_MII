Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a small bowl, stir together the cocoa and boiling water, set aside to cool. In a medium bowl, stir together the creamy salad dressing, sugar and vanilla. Add the flour and baking soda, mix well. Stir in the cocoa mixture until well blended. Drop cookies by heaping spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 7 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Test for doneness with a toothpick as you would a cake.
