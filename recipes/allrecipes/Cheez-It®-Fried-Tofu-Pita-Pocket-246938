Season tofu with salt and black pepper. Place cheese-flavored crackers, potato chips, and saltine crackers in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal and crush into crumbs using a rolling pin or can. Pour into a shallow dish. Whisk water and egg together in a small bowl. Dip tofu cubes in egg mixture then roll in crushed cracker mixture and place on a plate. Heat 6 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute tofu cubes, in batches if necessary, until golden brown, 30 seconds to 1 minute per side. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Reduce heat to medium. Season cherry tomatoes with salt and pepper and add to the skillet; cook and stir until slightly softened, about 1 minute. Combine chickpeas, tahini, and garlic in a food processor or blender; with motor running, add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and process until hummus is smooth and has a slight sheen. Spread some hummus in each pita pocket. Top with tofu cubes, cherry tomatoes, and baby spinach.
