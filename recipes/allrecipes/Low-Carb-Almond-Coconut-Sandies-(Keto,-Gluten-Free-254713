Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine coconut, almond meal, coconut oil, egg white, water, vanilla extract, Himalayan sea salt, and stevia powder in a large bowl. Let sit until coconut softens, about 10 minutes. Roll into generous tablespoon-sized balls; place on baking sheet. Flatten gently with a fork to prevent edges from crumbling. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
