Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease cookie sheets. In a medium bowl, mix together the butter, sugar, egg, and molasses until smooth. Combine the flour and ginger; stir into the molasses mixture until well blended. Drop large teaspoonfuls of dough about 3 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes on the top shelf of your oven. Reduce the oven temperature to 280 degrees F (137 degrees C). Allow the cookies to cool, then return them to a warm oven for 10 more minutes to dry out and become crispy.
