Whisk together flour, cornstarch, dry potato flakes, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. Whisk in club soda to make a smooth batter. Place panko bread crumbs in a shallow bowl. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a few onion rings at a time into the bowl of batter and turn to coat all sides with batter. Remove onion rings from batter and place into pan of panko bread crumbs; turn to coat completely with crumbs. Cook a few rings at a time in the hot oil until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack set over paper towels to drain. Season with salt to taste and serve.
