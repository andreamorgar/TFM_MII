Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 10x12 inch baking pan with parchment paper. In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Spread batter into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes, or until lightly browned. Carefully turn onto a sheet of parchment paper that has been sprinkled with superfine sugar. Remove paper from bottom. Set aside. Melt white chocolate, and set aside to cool to room temperature. In a medium bowl, beat cream cheese and sour cream until smooth. Blend in melted white chocolate. Spread over meringue sheet, leaving 1/2 inch border. Sprinkle evenly with raspberries. Carefully roll up the meringue from a short end, using the paper as a guide. Wrap securely in the paper and plastic wrap, and chill until firm. Cut into slices to serve.
