Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). In small bowl with mixer at high speed, beat egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Beating at high speed, gradually sprinkle in sugar, 2 Tablespoons at a time, beating until sugar is completely dissolved. (Whites should stand in stiff glossy peaks.) With rubber spatula, fold in coconut and extract until mixed. Drop mixture by rounded teaspoonfuls onto large cookie sheet, about 1 inch apart. Bake 1 hour or until dry. Remove to rack to cool.
