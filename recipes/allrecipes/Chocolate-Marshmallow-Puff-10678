Put marshmallows in the freezer for a couple of hours. In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, salt, cocoa, and baking soda. In a separate bowl, cream together the shortening and both sugars. Blend in unbeaten eggs and vanilla. Beat well. Stir in flour mixture and blend thoroughly. Stick bowl in fridge; until dough is hardened. Shape 1 teaspoon sized piece of dough around each marshmallow, seal well. Roll in sugar. Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) on greased sheet for 5 to 7 minutes, or until cookies crack. Cool for about 2 minutes before removing from cookie sheet.
