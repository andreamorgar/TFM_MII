Beat cream in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until foamy until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the cream will form soft mounds. Fold condensed milk and orange liqueur into beaten cream. Place in an ice cream maker and follow manufacturer's instructions for ice cream, 2 to 4 hours.
