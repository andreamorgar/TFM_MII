Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. In a large mixing bowl, sift whole wheat flour, bread flour, salt and baking powder. Sift three more times. Mix in 1/4 cup oil. In a separate bowl, dissolve honey in water. Stir into flour mixture. Mix just until a sticky dough pulls together. Turn dough out onto a well floured surface and divide into four pieces. Form pieces into desired shape. Place loaves on lightly greased baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 18 minutes. Remove from oven, brush with remaining 2 tablespoons oil and bake for 10 to 15 minutes longer, until bottom of loaf sounds hollow when tapped.
