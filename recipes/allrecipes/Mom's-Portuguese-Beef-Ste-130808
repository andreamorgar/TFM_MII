Heat the oil in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Dust the beef with the flour. Place the beef, garlic, bay leaves, and pepper in the stockpot; cook until the beef is brown; season with salt and cook until beef is tender, about 5 minutes. Add the onion, green pepper, carrot, and paprika; cook until the onion softens, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato, wine, water, and parsley. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 30 minutes. Mix in the red potatoes, sweet potatoes, and green beans; continue to cook until potatoes are easily pierced through with a fork, about 45 minutes.
