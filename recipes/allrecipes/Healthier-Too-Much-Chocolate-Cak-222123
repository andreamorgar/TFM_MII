Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup tube pan. Mix cake mix, pudding mix, sour cream, oil, beaten eggs, and water in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in chocolate chips. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven until top is springy to the touch and a wooden toothpick inserted comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Cool cake thoroughly in pan at least 1 1/2 hours before inverting onto plate. Dust with confectioner's sugar before serving.
