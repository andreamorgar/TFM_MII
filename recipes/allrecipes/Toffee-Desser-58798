Place the chocolate covered toffee bar and chocolate covered crispy peanut butter flavored candy bar in the freezer and let freeze 8 hours or overnight. In a medium bowl, mix together the saltine crackers, graham crackers, and melted butter. Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9x13 inch pan to make a crust. Chill crust in the refrigerator while you make the filling. In a large bowl, beat together the instant vanilla pudding mix, instant chocolate pudding mix, and milk. Fold in 12 ounces frozen whipped topping. Spread the filling over the prepared crust. Cover the filling with the remaining frozen whipped topping. Crush the frozen chocolate covered toffee bar and chocolate-covered crispy peanut butter flavored candy bar. Sprinkle the dessert with the crushed candy bars. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
