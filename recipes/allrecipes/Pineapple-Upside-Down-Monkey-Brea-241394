Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup tube pan(such as Bundt(R)). Unroll and separate biscuits; cut each portion into four or six pieces, depending on your preference. Spray cut biscuits with cooking spray to coat. Pour white sugar into gallon-size resealable plastic bag; add biscuits to bag, seal bag, and shake to coat. Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat; stir brown sugar and vanilla into the melted butter to dissolve the sugar. Pour butter mixture into the prepared tube pan. Sprinkle chopped pineapple evenly around the pan atop the butter mixture; top with sugar-coated biscuit dough. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 40 to 50 minutes; let cook in pan for 5 to 10 minutes before inverting onto a serving platter.
