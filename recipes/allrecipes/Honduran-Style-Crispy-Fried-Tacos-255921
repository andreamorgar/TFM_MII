Place chicken breasts and salt in a pot; cover halfway with water. Bring to a boil; cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes. Cool until easily handled, about 5 minutes. Shred into thin pieces. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, tomato, and green bell peppers; cook and stir until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in shredded chicken, 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon, and black pepper; cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Spoon some of the chicken mixture into the middle of each corn tortilla. Fold tortilla around filling and secure with a toothpick. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry tortillas in batches until golden and crispy, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Bring 1/4 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add tomato sauce, 1/2 teaspoon chicken bouillon, and seasoned salt. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Serve sauce over tacos.
