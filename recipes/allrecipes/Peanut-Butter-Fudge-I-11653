Line a 9x9 inch square pan with wax paper. In a medium sized saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Stir in the condensed milk. Add the peanut butter and chocolate chips, stirring constantly until everything is melted and blended together. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and refrigerate for 3 hours. Cut into squares when cool. Comes out perfect every time!
