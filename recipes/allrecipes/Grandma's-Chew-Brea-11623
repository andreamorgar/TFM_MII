Preheat oven to 400 degrees F ( 200 degrees C ). Grease a 15x10x1 inch jellyroll pan. In a heavy saucepan combine the sugar and eggs. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat, stir in the flour, salt, vanilla, and pecans. Spoon mixture into the prepared baking pan and bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool and cut into squares.
