Peel, pit and slice peaches. Place in small saucepan and add water until just covered. Sprinkle with 3 teaspoons of sugar and boil. Reduce heat and cook until peaches soften. Remove from heat and mash. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In small saucepan, heat oil and honey over low heat. Pour into bowl and beat in egg, applesauce and mashed peaches. Mix in flour, cinnamon and salt until well blended. Fold in oats, raisins and pineapple, stirring well. If the dough seems too dry, add more applesauce 1 tablespoon at a time. Drop by spoonfuls 2 inches apart on cookie sheets. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until lightly colored.
