Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9 inch pie dish with pastry. In a large saucepan, combine water and sugar. Cook over high heat until boiling. Put in cream of tartar and reduce heat to simmer. Drop the crackers in, one at a time, and stir until mixture is translucent. Remove from heat and sir in cinnamon, nutmeg and butter. Let filling cool, then put into pie crust. Cover with top crust, seal and flute edges. Bake in the preheated oven for 60 to 75 minutes, or until golden brown.
