Chill a glass mug in the freezer for at least 15 minutes. Combine the butterscotch topping and soda water in the chilled mug; stir until thoroughly mixed. Pour the cream soda into the mug. Stir the whipped cream, caramel sauce, and salt together in a small bowl; spoon atop the soda mixture. Stir lightly; it will froth!
