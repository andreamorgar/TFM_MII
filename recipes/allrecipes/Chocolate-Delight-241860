Put almond bark into a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave oven for 90 seconds and stir. Continue to heat in microwave in 15-second intervals until completely melted and smooth, 15 to 60 seconds. Stir peanut butter with the melted chocolate bark until smooth; add crispy rice cereal and pecans and stir to coat. Fold marshmallows and chocolate chips into the mixture to coat. Spread a sheet of waxed paper onto a flat surface. Drop the mixture by the spoonful onto the waxed paper and allow to cool completely.
