Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add arugula and cook until bright green, about 30 seconds. Remove arugula to a bowl full of ice water for several minutes until cold. Drain and wring out arugula. Pulse arugula, olive oil, almonds, and garlic together in a blender, scraping down the sides, until mixture just becomes a coarse puree. Pour puree into a bowl and season with salt.
