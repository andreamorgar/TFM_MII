Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Mix apples, raspberries, white sugar, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon flour, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl; pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix 1 cup flour, oats, brown sugar, butter, whole wheat flour, flax seeds, milk, yogurt, baking powder, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, salt, and baking soda together in a separate bowl until topping is crumbly. Spread topping over apple mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.
