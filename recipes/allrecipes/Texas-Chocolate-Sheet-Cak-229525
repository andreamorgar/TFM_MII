Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 15 1/2x10 1/2-inch jelly roll pan. Bring water, 1 cup margarine, and 1/4 cup cocoa powder to a boil in a large saucepan; remove from heat and stir in flour, white sugar, and salt. Beat eggs, sour cream, and baking soda in a bowl; stir into flour mixture until just blended. Pour batter into prepared jelly roll pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes. Meanwhile, bring 1/2 cup margarine, milk, 1/4 cup cocoa powder, and vanilla extract to a boil in another saucepan; remove from heat and stir in confectioner's sugar until icing is smooth. Spread icing over cake immediately after removing from oven. Allow cake to cool before cutting and serving.
