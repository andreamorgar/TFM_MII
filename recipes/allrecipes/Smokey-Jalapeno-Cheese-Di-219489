Place the Cheddar cheese into a bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the mayonnaise with the jalapeno peppers, 2 tablespoons of the liquid from the diced jalapenos, smoke flavoring, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. Mix until thoroughly blended. Stir into the Cheddar cheese, turn into a serving dish, and serve.
