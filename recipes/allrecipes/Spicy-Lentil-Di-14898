In a medium saucepan combine the lentils, onion and water. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 25 minutes or until lentils are soft. Pass lentils through a food mill or blend them in a blender. Toast curry powder and cumin seeds in a small skillet over medium heat until fragrant. Add cayenne, oil and garlic. Saute for 1 minute. Stir spice mixture into lentils and serve.
