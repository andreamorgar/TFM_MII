Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Thoroughly mix artichoke hearts, Alfredo sauce, spinach, Parmesan-Romano cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, garlic, and black pepper in a bowl; spread into an 8-inch square baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until cheeses are bubbling and melted, 25 to 30 minutes.
