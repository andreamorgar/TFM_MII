Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour loaf pan. In a large bowl combine flour, baking soda and cinnamon. Set aside. In a medium bowl blend together with an electric mixer the oil, sugar, eggs and banana until well combined. Add banana mix to the flour mix. Add the strawberries. Mix with a spoon until combined. Do not overmix. Pour the mix into the loaf pan and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and the loaf is well browned. Note: Blueberries or chocolate chips are great in place of the strawberries.
