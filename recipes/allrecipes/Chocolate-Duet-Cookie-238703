Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth and creamy. Beat 1 egg into butter mixture; beat remaining egg and vanilla extract into butter mixture. Stir flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl; add to creamed butter mixture and beat until the dry ingredients are integrated into a dough. Fold walnuts, white chocolate chips, and semisweet chocolate chips into the dough. Drop dough by teaspoonful onto baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until browning along the edges, 9 to 12 minutes.
