Cover the bottom of a large bowl with 1/3 of the angel food cake cubes. Generously cover the cake with 1 1/3 cups yogurt. Spread 1 1/3 cups of the strawberry slices and blueberries on top of the yogurt. Repeat twice with the remaining cake cubes, yogurt, and berries. Serve immediately or chill until needed.
