Place bread in a blender and blend until soft crumbs form. Place bread crumbs in a shallow bowl. Heat butter in a saucepan over medium heat until melted. Stir flour into melted butter until dissolved. Mix milk and broth into butter-flour mixture; cook and stir until mixture is thick, about 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and cool mixture. Mix turkey, parsley, rosemary, salt, and pepper into cooled mixture. Form turkey mixture into balls. Place balls on a plate and refrigerate until chilled, at least 3 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dip balls in the beaten egg, allowing excess to drip back into bowl. Press balls into bread crumbs until coated. Arrange balls on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and browned, 25 to 30 minutes.
