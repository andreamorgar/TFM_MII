Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Arrange baguette slices in a single layer on the baking sheet. Lightly brush olive oil on each slice. Bake in the preheated oven until bread starts to crisp, about 12 minutes. Remove from oven. Sprinkle half of the grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese over slices and return to oven; bake for 5 minutes. Remove from oven. Turn each slice over and sprinkle with remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Return to oven and bake until crisp, 5 to 10 minutes.
