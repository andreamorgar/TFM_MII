Mix almond milk, egg yolks, coconut sugar, cornstarch, and salt together in a large saucepan and, stirring constantly, bring to a boil. Cook and stir almond milk mixture until it thickens, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir shredded coconut, butter, and vanilla extract into milk mixture. Remove saucepan from heat and allow pudding to cool to room temperature. Divide sliced bananas between 8 serving bowls and pour pudding over top.
