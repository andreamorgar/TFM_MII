Whisk the self-rising flour, sugar, eggs, evaporated milk, and water together in a saucepan placed over medium-high heat. Whisk constantly while bringing the mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Whisking constantly, cook the pudding at a simmer until thickened, about 15 to 20 minutes. When the pudding has thickened, stir in the margarine and vanilla extract until thoroughly combined. Remove pudding from heat and set aside for about 10 minutes to cool. Sprinkle pudding with cinnamon, and serve warm.
