Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix together cashew butter, dried cranberries, almonds, coconut oil, egg, dates, and honey in a bowl until thoroughly incorporated. Place spoonfuls of mixture onto a nonstick baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until cookies smell toasted, about 12 minutes. Allow to cool and harden.
