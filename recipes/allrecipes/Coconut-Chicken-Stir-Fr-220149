Melt butter in large frying pan over medium heat. Cook and stir the cumin seeds in butter until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir chicken into the skillet with cumin seeds, and cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain any excess juices, if any. Pour vegetable oil into skillet with chicken, and heat oil until sizzling. Mix in onion, carrots, garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, honey, ground cumin, cinnamon, curry powder, salt, and black pepper to the pan; cook until onions are translucent and carrots done, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in coconut milk and simmer until flavors have blended, about 10 minutes.
