Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place sweet potatoes in an aluminum foil-lined baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until potatoes are easily pierced with a fork and skin loosens, 30 to 45 minutes. Allow potatoes to cool. Peel potatoes and mash with a potato masher in a large bowl. Beat sugar, evaporated milk, butter, corn syrup, eggs, flour, vanilla extract, apple pie spice, and salt into mashed sweet potatoes with an electric mixer until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Pour sweet potato batter into pie crust. Excess batter can be reserved for another use. Bake in preheated oven until pie is set and crust is browned, 45 to 50 minutes.
