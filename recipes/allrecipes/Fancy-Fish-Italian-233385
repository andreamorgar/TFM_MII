Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion in the hot oil until almost tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning to onion; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir zucchini, yellow squash, olives, and capers into onion mixture; top with cod fillets. Sprinkle tomatoes, remaining 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper onto cod fillets. Reduce heat, cover skillet, and cook until fish flakes easily with a fork and zucchini is tender, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over fish; cover skillet until cheese melts, about 2 minutes.
