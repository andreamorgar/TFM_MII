Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Clean and dry pumpkin seeds so there is no goo or strings. Melt butter onto a cookie sheet. Spread pumpkin seeds evenly over the buttered sheet and sprinkle with salt and water. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, shaking the pan every 4 minutes to ensure even baking.
