Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Place salmon fillets on a non-stick baking pan. Brush juice on salmon. In a shallow dish, combine panko, coconut, salt and pepper. Dredge each fillet in the mixture and return to baking pan. Spread leftover crumbs on top of each fillet. Coat with cooking spray. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes. If desired, put under broiler until crust is golden brown.
