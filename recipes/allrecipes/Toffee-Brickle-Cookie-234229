Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat eggs and margarine together in a bowl until smooth. Add cake mix, toffee bits, pecans, and water; stir until batter is blended. Drop tablespoonfuls of batter onto a large baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 17 minutes. Allow cookies to cool for 5 minutes before removing from baking sheet.
