In a bowl, combine the first five ingredients. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in oats and milk just until moistened. Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Roll to 3/4-in. thickness; cut with a floured 2-in. biscuit cutter. Place 1 in. apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until lightly browned. Serve warm.
