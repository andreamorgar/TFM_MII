Combine 3/4 cup mayonnaise, ketchup, warm water, and vinegar in a large bowl and mix well. Stir in chopped gherkins, cocktail onions, diced apple, and shredded carrot. Add corned beef, mashed potatoes, and salt and pepper to taste; mix well. Form the potato salad on a plate as a loaf or a round mound. Garnish with slices of cucumber, halved cherry tomatoes, and slices of egg. Decorate with swirls or wavy lines of mayonnaise to add a little flair (see Cook's Note). Chill for at least 2 hours to allow the flavors to blend.
