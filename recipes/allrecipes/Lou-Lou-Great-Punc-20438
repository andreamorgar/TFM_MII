Use 1 liter of lemon-lime soda to fill an ice cube tray. Reserving the cherry juice, place the maraschino cherries into the soda filled tray. Freeze 1 hour, or until solid. In a punch bowl, mix the remaining 1 liter lemon-lime soda, reserved maraschino cherry juice, pineapple juice, and orange juice concentrate. Flavor with peppermint and vanilla extract. Slide in the orange sherbet and the ice cubes you made earlier.
