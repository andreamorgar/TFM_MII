Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Crumble and set aside. In a preheated skillet, add the chicken, seasoning mix and oil. Cook until chicken is golden brown. Remove from heat and set aside. In a salad bowl, combine Romaine, enough salad dressing to coat, Parmesan cheese and bacon. Toss and place on individual salad plates. Top with the sliced chicken and serve.
