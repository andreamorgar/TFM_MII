Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix graham cracker crumbs and melted butter together in a bowl until cracker crumbs are moistened. Press evenly into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 7 minutes. Mix peanut butter, confectioners' sugar, honey, and vanilla extract together in a mixing bowl; stir in brown sugar. Fold flour into peanut butter mixture until well incorporated. Spread peanut butter mixture over graham cracker crust. Sprinkle with chocolate chips and peanut butter chips. Bake in the preheated oven until chips start to melt, 13 to 15 minutes. Cool before cutting into squares.
