Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place the artichoke hearts in a food processor and process until smooth. Process the cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, mayonnaise, garlic and dill with the artichoke hearts until the mixture is smooth and well blended. Transfer to a 9 inch pie pan. Bake in the preheated oven 10 to 15 minutes, or until bubbly and lightly brown.
