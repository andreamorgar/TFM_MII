Thoroughly cream shortening and sugar; add egg and beat well. Melt chocolate over low heat. Add chocolate and vanilla to shortening mixture. Mix well. Sift dry ingredients; add to creamed mixture alternately with milk. Stir in nuts. Shape into rolls. Wrap in waxed paper; chill thoroughly or overnight. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Using a sharp knife, cut 1/4 inch thick slices off the rolls and place about 2 inches apart on cookie sheets. Bake 8 to 10 minutes.
