In a large saucepan over high heat combine sugar and milk. When bubbles form at the edges, stir in rice and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook 60 minutes, stirring often, until rice is tender. Do not allow to boil. Remove from heat and vigorously stir in beaten eggs, a little at a time, until well incorporated. Serve warm.
