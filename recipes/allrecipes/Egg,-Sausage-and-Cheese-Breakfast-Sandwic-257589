Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Toast buns until golden brown. Cook sausage patties in a skillet over medium heat until brown. While preparing sausage, whisk the eggs together in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. In a clean saute pan add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and scramble the eggs till cooked throughout. Combine Sriracha sauce and mayonnaise and spread on each side of the buns. Place a sausage patty onto the four bottom buns. For each sandwich, top sausage with eggs, cheese and arugula. Serve while warm.
