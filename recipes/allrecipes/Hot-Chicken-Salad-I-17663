Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl blend together the chicken, celery, bell pepper, onion, pimento, salt, lemon juice and mayonnaise. Spread mixture into the bottom of a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish, sprinkle with cheese and top with potato chip crumbs. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes, or until cheese is melted and casserole is bubbly.
