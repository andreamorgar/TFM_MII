Place broccoli in a medium saucepan with enough water to cover. Cover, and bring to a boil. Cook 5 minutes. Uncover, and continue cooking 2 to 3 minutes, until tender. Remove from heat, drain, and cool. In a large bowl, mix broccoli, stuffing mix, Parmesan cheese, onion, eggs, margarine, pepper, and garlic salt. Cover, and chill in the refrigerator approximately 1 hour, until moisture has been absorbed. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Roll the chilled mixture into 1 inch balls, and arrange on a medium baking sheet. Bake 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until browned.
