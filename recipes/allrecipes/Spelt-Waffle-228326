Preheat and grease a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Combine spelt flour, flax seed meal, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Stir coconut milk, coconut oil, eggs, vinegar, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Add coconut milk mixture to flour mixture; stir to combine. Let batter thicken for 1 to 2 minutes. Pour about 1 cup batter into waffle iron. Cook until golden and crisp, about 6 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
