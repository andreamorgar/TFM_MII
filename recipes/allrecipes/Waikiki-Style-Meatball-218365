Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Thoroughly mix the ground beef, bread crumbs, onion, milk, egg, and salt together in a bowl. Roll the mixture into balls and arrange onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the meatballs are browned on the bottom, about 25 minutes. Transfer to a slow cooker. Stir the cornstarch and brown sugar together in the bottom of a saucepan and place over low heat. Add the reserved pineapple juice and vinegar; stir until smooth. Bring the mixture to a boil for 1 full minute before removing from heat; pour over the meatballs in the slow cooker. Add the pineapple chunks and green bell pepper to the slow cooker. Cook the mixture in the slow cooker on Low until the flavors are thoroughly combined, 3 to 4 hours.
