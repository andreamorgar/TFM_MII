Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Mix together salt, caraway seeds, oregano, garlic salt, ground black pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes in a small bowl. Mix ground beef and eggs in a mixing bowl until thoroughly incorporated. Add Parmesan cheese and seasoning mixture to beef; combine. Press ground beef mixture into a 12x17-inch pan, spread out evenly. Bake in the preheated oven until meat is no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain grease. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and turn on the oven's broiler. Sprinkle 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese over baked meat, followed by tomato sauce in an even layer. Sprinkle another 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese over the sauce and top with slices of pepperoni. Sprinkle remaining mozzarella cheese over pizza. Broil until cheese is melted, bubbling, and lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes.
