Bring the water to a boil in a pot; stir the rice into the boiling water, reduce heat to low, place cover on the pot, and allow the rice to cook until all the moisture is absorbed, about 30 minutes. As the rice cooks, heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the chourico in the hot oil for 2 minutes. Add the onions and garlic to the sausage and continue cooking until the vegetables are soft and the chourico has browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir the tomato sauce into the chourico mixture. Reduce heat to low. Season with the red pepper flakes, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper; simmer until thoroughly heated, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir the fava beans into the mixture and continue cooking just long enough for the beans to heat, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve over rice.
