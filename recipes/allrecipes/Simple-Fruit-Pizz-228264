Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 12-inch pizza pan. Press cookie dough into pizza pan; prick holes in dough with a fork. Bake in preheated oven until golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Allow cookie crust to cool. Beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth; spread over cooled crust. Arrange strawberries, blueberries, bananas, and kiwi decoratively over cream cheese mixture. Mix orange marmalade and water in a small bowl; spoon mixture over fruit. Chill for 1 hour before serving.
