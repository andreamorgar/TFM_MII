Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cut bread into two 3-inch sections and cut each section in half. Place bread pieces on a baking sheet and drizzle olive oil over each piece. Bake in the preheated oven until toasted, 5 to 7 minutes. Sprinkle garlic over toasted bread pieces. Spoon avocado pieces onto each toast and sprinkle feta cheese over avocado layer.
