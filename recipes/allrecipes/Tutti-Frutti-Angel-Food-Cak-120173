In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy. Add cream of tartar and salt; beat until soft peaks form. Add extracts and food coloring if desired. Add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition; beat until stiff glossy peaks form. Gradually fold in flour, 1/4 cup at a time. Fold in candied fruit. Gently spoon into an ungreased 10-in. tube pan. Bake at 375 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Immediately invert pan; cool completely. Run a knife around sides of cake and remove.
