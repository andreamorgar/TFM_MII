Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan. Into a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Make a well in the flour mixture. Add the mashed bananas, oil, vanilla, eggs and pineapple with juice. Fold in nuts. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 90 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool completely on wire rack.
