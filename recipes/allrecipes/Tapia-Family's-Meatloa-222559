Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix ground beef, Mexican-style tomato sauce, eggs, onion soup mix, bread crumbs, green chiles, garlic and herb seasoning, and garlic powder in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Place mixture into a large loaf pan and shape into a loaf. Bake in the preheated oven until meatloaf is no longer pink inside and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the middle of the loaf shows at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 1 hour.
