Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a mixing bowl, mash the beans with a fork. Combine the salad dressing, sour cream, green chilies, cilantro, chili powder, garlic powder and hot pepper sauce. Blend well. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Serve with the baked tortilla chips. Spray the tortillas lightly with olive oil, and sprinkle lightly with salt. Bake until crisp and lightly browned.
