Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Add grated sweet potatoes; cook and stir until tender, about 15 minutes. Increase heat to high and cook sweet potato mixture without stirring for 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and stir in bacon, chives, parsley, thyme, salt, and pepper.
