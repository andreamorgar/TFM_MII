Brown beef in a large skillet over a medium-high heat. Drain the fat from the pan once the meat is browned. Mix Cheddar cheese, tomatoes, corn and barbecue sauce into the meat. Heat this mixture, stirring occasionally. While the mixture is heating, make beds of chips onto 4 plates. Pour the hot mixture over the chips. Enjoy!
