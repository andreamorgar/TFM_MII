Mix together the buttermilk with the baking soda. Set aside. Cream shortening, sugar, eggs and vanilla. Beat well. Add buttermilk and baking soda mixture. Sift dry ingredients, and add to creamed mixture. Add boiling water, and mix well. Pour into a greased and floured 9 x 13 inch pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for approximately 35 minutes, or until toothpick comes out clean. Let cool. I frost with cream cheese frosting.
