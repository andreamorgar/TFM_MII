Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease and flour a 16 x 11 x 1 inch pan. Cream butter or margarine and sugar. Separate egg, and set aside egg white. Add egg yolk and sifted dry ingredients. Pour batter into pan. Beat egg white until foamy and brush sparingly over batter (not all egg white will be used.) Sprinkle chopped nuts over top. Bake for 30 minutes.
