Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange English muffin halves, cut-side up, on a baking sheet. Spoon 1 to 2 tablespoons pizza sauce onto each English muffin; top with mozzarella cheese. Place pepperoni slices on 1/3 the pizzas and Italian sausage on 1/3 the English muffins, leaving the remaining 1/3 with just cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.
