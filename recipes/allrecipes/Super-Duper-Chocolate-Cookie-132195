Melt the chocolate and shortening in a saucepan over low heat. Remove from heat and mix in sugar and vanilla. Beat in eggs 1 at a time. In a bowl, sift together flour, baking powder and salt. Stir in the chocolate mixture and nuts. Chill dough in the refrigerator 3 hours or overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Place confectioners' sugar in a bowl. Roll dough into 1 inch balls. Roll dough balls in confectioners' sugar to coat. Arrange 3 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets. Bake 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven. The cookies will look soft when removed from the oven. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Enjoy!
