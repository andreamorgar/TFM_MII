Bring the brown rice and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes. Bring the coconut milk and evaporated milk to a simmer in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir the sucralose sweetener into the mixture until dissolved. Add the cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and molasses to the mixture and mix well. Temper the eggs by stirring about 2 tablespoons of the coconut mixture into the eggs; add to the mixture in the saucepan along with the almond extract. Stir the cooked rice into the mixture, breaking the grains apart with a spoon as you stir. Reduce heat to low and simmer until the mixture thickens, about 45 minutes.
