Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 8x8-inch baking pan with parchment paper. Mix oats, raisins, wheat germ, whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the middle. Whisk applesauce, honey, egg, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl until combined; pour into well of dry ingredients. Stir with two spoons until fully incorporated. Pour and press batter into prepared baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until firm, about 20 minutes. Remove from pan and cool for about 10 minutes before slicing into 12 pieces.
