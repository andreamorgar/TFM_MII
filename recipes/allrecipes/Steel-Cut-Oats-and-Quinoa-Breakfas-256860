Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; add quinoa and oats. Simmer, stirring frequently, until water is absorbed and quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir almond meal and flaxseed meal into quinoa mixture; pour into a glass container and top with cinnamon. Let cool, about 15 minutes. Transfer to the refrigerator.
