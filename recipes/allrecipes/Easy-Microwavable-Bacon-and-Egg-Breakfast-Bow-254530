Spray the inside of a microwave-safe mug with cooking spray. Layer the tortillas in the mug. Place 4 bacon halves on top of the tortillas. Crack egg over bacon layer and top with remaining bacon halves. Cover mug with a paper towel. Cook in the microwave until egg is set and bacon is cooked, about 4 minutes. Remove tortilla bowls from mug.
