Whisk coconut flour, rice flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Mix buttermilk, egg yolks, butter, and almond extract together in a separate bowl. Heat griddle to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) or a skillet over medium-high heat; lightly grease with macadamia nut oil. Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until medium peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the tip of the peak formed by the egg whites should curl over slightly. Stir buttermilk mixture into flour mixture; fold in egg whites, 1/3 at a time, until batter is just mixed and thick. Ladle batter onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
