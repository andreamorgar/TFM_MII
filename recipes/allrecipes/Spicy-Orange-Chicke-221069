Whisk orange juice, brown sugar, rice vinegar, fish sauce, soy sauce, ginger, and crushed red pepper flakes in a large bowl. Mix in chicken pieces and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Remove chicken from refrigerator and drain thoroughly in colander, reserving marinade. Heat a large non-stick skillet over high heat. Cook and stir chicken for 2 minutes; spoon out any excess liquid. Continue to cook and stir until chicken caramelizes, 6 to 7 minutes. Stir in white portions of green onions, garlic, and orange zest; cook and stir 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in half of reserved marinade. Simmer until reduced and thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in jalapeno pepper, bell pepper, and sugar snap peas; cook and stir until vegetables are warmed, about 2 minutes. Stir in green portions of green onions; cook and stir 1 minute. Remove from heat. Garnish with cilantro and serve.
