Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan; cook the corn kernels in the boiling water until tender. Stir the sugar into the mixture. Whisk the tapioca flour with 1/3 cup water in a bowl until you have a thick slurry; stir the slurry into the corn mixture and cook until the mixture thickens. Remove from heat. Divide into 4 separate bowls. Combine the coconut cream and salt in a separate small saucepan and heat over medium-low heat to a simmer, being careful to not bring to a boil, until thoroughly heated; drizzle over the pudding to serve.
