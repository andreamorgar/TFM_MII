Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Separate 6 biscuits into 2 rounds each. Gently stretch each round into a 5-inch circle. Press into cups of a non-stick muffin tin. Lightly oil a skillet and place over medium-high heat. Cook turkey in skillet, separating into small pieces as it browns. When turkey is no longer pink, turn heat down to medium-low. Add taco seasoning, stirring to combine. Stir in Sloppy Joe sauce; continue cooking until heat through, about 5 minutes. Fill biscuit-lined muffin cups with turkey mixture. Bake in preheated oven until browned and hot, about 13 minutes. Divide each slice of cheese into quarters, and place one-quarter slice on top of each filled cup. Bake 3 minutes more, or until cheese is melted. Allow to cool in the pan 5 minutes, then place on a rack until cool enough to eat.
