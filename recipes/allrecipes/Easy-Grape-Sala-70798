Wash grapes in a colander under running water, and remove all stems. Place in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, stir together the cream cheese and marshmallow creme until smooth and creamy. Pour the mixture over the grapes. Using a rubber spatula or large serving spoon, fold the mixture into the grapes until well coated. Fold in the almonds. This salad may be served immediately, or covered and refrigerated for 1 hour to set slightly, and to allow flavors to blend.
