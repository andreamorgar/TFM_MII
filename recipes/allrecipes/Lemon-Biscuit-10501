Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease baking sheets. Sift together dry ingredients. Mix together butter (melted), sugar and extract. Beat in eggs. Roll dough about 1/8 inch thick on a lightly floured board. Cut into squares or rounds and place 1 inch apart on cookie sheet. Sprinkle with granulated sugar. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden.
