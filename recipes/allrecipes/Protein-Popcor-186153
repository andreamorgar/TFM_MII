Bring the corn syrup, honey, and sugar to a boil in a saucepan; cook at a boil for 2 minutes. Immediately remove from heat and stir the peanut butter and vanilla into the syrup mixture until the peanut butter has melted completely. Pour the popcorn into a large bowl; pour the sauce over the popcorn and stir until evenly coated. Allow to cool completely and break into chunks to serve.
