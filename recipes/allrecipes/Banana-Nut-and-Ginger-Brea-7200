Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans. In a large bowl, mix the brown sugar, banana, eggs, and vanilla. For moister bread, add oil, if desired. In a separate bowl, sift together 3 cups flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, all spice, cardamom, and cloves. Alternately blend the flour mixture and beer into the banana mixture. Toss the walnuts with the remaining flour. Stir in the dates and ginger to the mixture and blend well. Pour into two loaf pans. Bake in preheated oven until inserted toothpick inserted into the center of each loaf comes out clean, about 1 hour.
