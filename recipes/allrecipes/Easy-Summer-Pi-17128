Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Roll pastry into an 11 inch circle. Lay flat on a baking sheet or pizza pan. Prick several times with a fork. Bake in preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until light brown. Remove and allow to cool completely. In a small mixing bowl, beat together cream cheese and sugar until mixture is creamy and smooth. Spread evenly onto cooled pastry. Arrange fruit in a decorative pattern over cream cheese layer. Chill until ready to serve.
