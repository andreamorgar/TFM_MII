Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a loaf pan with parchment paper. Mix almond flour, grapeseed oil, 3 tablespoons agave nectar, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl; press into the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Cool completely. Place dates in a food processor and process until a paste forms. Add almond butter and hot water and process until very smooth. Spread date mixture evenly over the cooled crust; refrigerate. Whisk coconut oil, cacao powder, and 2 tablespoons agave nectar together in a bowl until smooth; pour over date layer. Refrigerate until chocolate layer is set, 8 hours to overnight.
