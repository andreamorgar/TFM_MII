Combine honey, hoisin sauce, dark soy sauce, star anise, five-spice powder, and aji mirin in a glass measuring cup. Set microwave oven for 60 percent power and heat in microwave oven for 22 seconds. Stir mixture and pour into a large resealable plastic bag. Add pork loin to the bag, knead to coat meat with marinade, and refrigerate at least 4 hours or up to two days. Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove pork roast from bag and wrap meat tightly in aluminum foil. Discard used marinade. Cook on the preheated grill until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the roast reads 155 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 50 minutes. Let meat stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
