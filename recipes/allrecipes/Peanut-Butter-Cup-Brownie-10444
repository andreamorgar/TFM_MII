Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Combine brownie mix, oil, egg and water in a large bowl. Stir 50 strokes with a spoon. Place batter in a cupcake pan (cupcake wrappers recommended). Once cups are 3/4 of the way full, place an unwrapped miniature peanut butter cup in the middle, then bake for 30-35 minutes keeping an eye on them while they're baking. Let them cool and then they're ready to eat!!
