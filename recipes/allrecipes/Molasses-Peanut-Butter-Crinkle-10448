Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix together the brown sugar, peanut butter, butter, molasses and egg in a large bowl. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, ginger, cloves and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir until well blended. For each cookie, shape a generous tablespoon of dough into a ball and roll in granulated sugar. Place the cookies 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 10 minutes, or until just set. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
