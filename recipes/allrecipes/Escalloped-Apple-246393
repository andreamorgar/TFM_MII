Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Combine brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves together in a large bowl; add apples and toss to coat. Stir raisins, walnuts, and butter into apple mixture. Spread apple mixture evenly in prepared baking dish. Combine milk and vanilla extract together in a bowl; pour evenly over apple mixture. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven until apples are easily pierced with a fork, about 30 minutes. Remove foil and stir apples. Bake until apples are very soft and mixture is bubbly, about 30 minutes more.
