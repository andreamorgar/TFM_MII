Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F. Spray a large cookie sheet with non-stick spray. In a large bowl, with a mixer set on low speed, beat corn-oil spread and brown sugar until blended. Increase speed to high; beat until well combined, about 3 minutes. At low speed, add egg whites, egg, and vanilla; beat until smooth. With spoon, stir in flour, oats, raisins, baking powder, and salt until combined. Drop dough by heaping tablespoons, about 2 inches apart, on cookie sheet. Flatten dough into 3-inch circles. Bake cookies 16-18 minutes or until golden brown. With a pancake turner, remove cookies to wire racks to cool for 15 minutes. Store cookies in tightly covered container.
