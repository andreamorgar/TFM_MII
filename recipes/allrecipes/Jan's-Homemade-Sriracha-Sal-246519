Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Mix salt and sriracha hot sauce together in a small bowl. Spread mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and turn off the heat; let sit in the oven without opening the door, about 3 hours. Stir salt mixture, breaking up any clumps. If not completely dry, repeat the process and check after 1 hour. Place dry salt mixture in a food processor and pulse for a few seconds until clumps are gone.
