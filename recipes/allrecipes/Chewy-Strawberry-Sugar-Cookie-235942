Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Beat 1 1/2 cups white sugar and butter together in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy, about 3 minutes. Beat egg into butter mixture. Add strawberry puree. Stir flour, vanilla extract, baking powder, and salt into strawberry mixture with a spoon until flour is completely incorporated into dough. Stir 1/2 cup white sugar and red sugar together in a shallow bowl. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls, roll each ball in red sugar mixture, and place each ball 1 1/2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheets. Lightly press each dough ball down to flatten. Bake cookies in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool.
