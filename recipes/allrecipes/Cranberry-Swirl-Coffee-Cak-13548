Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour one 9 or 10 inch tube pan. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the almond extract. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture alternately with the sour cream. Pour 1/3 of the batter into the prepared tube pan. Swirl 1/2 of the cranberry sauce into the batter. Repeat, ending with the batter on top. Bake 55 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown.
