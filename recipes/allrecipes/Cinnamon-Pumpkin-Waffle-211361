Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Combine flour, wheat germ, sugar, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg, salt, and baking powder in a bowl. Set aside. Beat together milk, pumpkin puree, butter, oil, applesauce, whole egg, and egg white. Stir flour mixture into the pumpkin mixture along with the pecans. Ladle the batter onto the preheated waffle iron. Cook the waffles until golden and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes.
