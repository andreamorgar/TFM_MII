Pour the vodka into a 1-liter glass bottle, and add the grains of paradise. Close the bottle, and shake gently. Store in a cool place for 5 to 7 days; gently shake the bottle once a day. Strain the vodka through a very fine metal mesh strainer, such as a wine strainer, into a sterile glass container. (Using a coffee filter will strip some of the flavoring oils out of the vodka.)
