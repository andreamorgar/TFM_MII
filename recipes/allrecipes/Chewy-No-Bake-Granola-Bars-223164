Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix rolled oats, steel-cut oats, rice cereal, dried fruit, and almonds together in a large bowl. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; add brown sugar, honey, and vanilla extract. Whisk until sugar is completely dissolved, about 2 minutes. Pour over oat mixture; stir to combine. Spread oat mixture into prepared baking dish. Press chocolate chips into top. Refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.
