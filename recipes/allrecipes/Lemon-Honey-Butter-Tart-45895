Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat eggs in a large bowl. Stir in brown sugar, honey, lemon juice, lemon zest, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Blend in melted butter. Fill tart shells halfway. Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown, and filling is set.
