Put ham in deep 10- to 20-quart pot and cover with cold water (don't worry if bone sticks out). Bring to a boil, then drain ham. Put oven rack in lower third of oven (remove any other racks) and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Wash leeks in a bowl of cold water, then lift out and drain well. Cook leeks, onion, carrots, celery, garlic, thyme sprigs, parsley stems, nutmeg, peppercorns, and cloves in 2 tablespoons butter in wide 7- to 10-quart heavy pot (see Special Equipment) over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Add wine and bring to a boil, then add ham, skin side down, and water (liquid will not cover ham) and return to a boil. Cover pot tightly with lid or, if ham sticks up over top of pot, with heavy-duty foil. Braise ham in oven 1 hour. Turn ham skin side up and continue to braise in oven, covered, until thermometer inserted into center of ham (do not touch bone) registers 120 degrees F, about 1 hour more (if ham was labeled "fully cooked"), or 160 degrees F, about 2 hours more (if ham was labeled "partially cooked"). While ham braises, mash together flour and remaining 3 tablespoons butter with a fork to make a beurre manie. Transfer ham to a platter and let stand, loosely covered with foil, 45 minutes. While ham stands, pour braising liquid through a fine-mesh sieve into a 3-quart saucepan, pressing on and discarding solids, and skim off any fat. Bring braising liquid to a simmer and whisk in beurre manie 1/2 tablespoon at a time (sauce will become lumpy). Continue to simmer, whisking, until sauce is smooth and slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in chopped thyme and parsley. Remove skin from ham, then slice meat and serve with sauce. Ham can be braised 2 days ahead and cooled in braising liquid, uncovered, then chilled, covered. Skim any fat before reheating ham, in braising liquid, on top of stove.
