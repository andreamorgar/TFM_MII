Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut peaches into 16 crescent-shaped slices. Unroll crescent roll dough on a flat work surface and separate into 16 triangles. Place a peach slice at the base of each triangle and roll up to enclose in the dough. Arrange turnovers in a baking pan. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in sugar, vanilla extract, and salt. Pour evenly over the turnovers in the baking pan. Pour citrus-flavored soda over the turnovers. Sprinkle cinnamon on top. Bake in the preheated oven until turnovers are golden brown and liquid is bubbling, 30 to 40 minutes.
