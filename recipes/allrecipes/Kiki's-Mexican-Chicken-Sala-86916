In a large bowl, gently mix the chicken, carrots, red bell pepper, jicama, red onion, corn, cherry tomatoes, avocados, and cilantro. In a separate bowl, mix the sour cream, mayonnaise, lemon juice, cumin, salt, pepper, taco seasoning, and hot pepper sauce. Pour over the salad, and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving.
