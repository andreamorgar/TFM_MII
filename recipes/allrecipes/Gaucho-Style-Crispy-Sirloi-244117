Preheat grill to 400 degrees F. In a bowl, whisk beef base, olive oil, garlic and black pepper. Add steaks to mixture and coat. Marinate in refrigerator for 30 minutes or up to 6 hours. When ready to cook, place steaks directly on grill and allow grill to flame-up while turning to char outer surface. Cook to desired temperature (approximately 5 to 6 minutes).
