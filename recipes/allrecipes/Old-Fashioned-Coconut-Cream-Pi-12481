Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread the coconut on a baking sheet and bake it, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. In a medium saucepan, combine the half-and-half, eggs, sugar, flour and salt and mix well. Bring to a boil over low heat, stirring constantly. Cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes more. Remove the pan from the heat, and stir in 3/4 cup of the toasted coconut and the vanilla extract. Reserve the remaining coconut to top the pie. Pour the filling into the pie shell and chill until firm, about 4 hours. Top with whipped topping and with the reserved coconut.
