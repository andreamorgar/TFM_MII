Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut eggplant strips in half again, lengthwise. Lay strips on a baking sheet. In a small bowl combine bread crumbs, Romano cheese, garlic, parsley, oregano, salt and pepper. Sprinkle over eggplant strips and drizzle with oil. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, or until crispy.
