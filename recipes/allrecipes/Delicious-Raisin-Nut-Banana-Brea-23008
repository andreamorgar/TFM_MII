Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease the bottom of a 9x5 inch loaf pan. In a bowl, combine the raisin nut bran cereal and milk; let stand for 5 minutes. In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl, beat together mashed banana, sugar, brown sugar, vegetable oil and egg. Combine the cereal and banana mixtures. Stir in the flour mixture just until combined. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 50 to 55 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of loaf comes out clean. Let cool before slicing.
