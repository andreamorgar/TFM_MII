In a large bowl, mix flour, salt and sugar. Pour in milk, a little at a time, stirring to make a smooth batter. Beat in eggs and lemon zest. Core and peel apples, then cut in wedges. Cut each wedge crosswise into thin slices. Toss apples in batter to coat. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil and butter. Drop fritter mixture by spoonfuls into pan and cook, turning once, until golden brown. Plate and sprinkle with sugar. Serve warm.
