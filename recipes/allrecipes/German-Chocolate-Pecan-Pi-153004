Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk the corn syrup, eggs, sugar, butter, and vanilla together in a mixing bowl until light-colored and well blended. Stir in the pecans and coconut. Sprinkle the chocolate chips over the bottom of the prepared pie crust. Pour the corn syrup mixture over the chocolate chips. Bake in preheated oven until top is set, 55 to 60 minutes. Cool completely on a rack before serving, about 2 hours.
