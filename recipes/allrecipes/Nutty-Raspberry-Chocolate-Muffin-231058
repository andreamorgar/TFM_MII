Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or fill with paper liners. Mix almond meal, all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Beat butter and sugar together in a separate bowl until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one by one, beating until each is incorporated. Stir vanilla into the butter mixture. Mix milk and yogurt together in a separate bowl. Add butter mixture, alternating with milk mixture, to the flour mixture until just incorporated. Stir mashed banana into batter; fold in raspberries and chocolate chips. Fill muffin cups 3/4-full with batter. Bake on the middle rack in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the muffins comes out clean, 18 to 25 minutes.
