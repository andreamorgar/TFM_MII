In a large pot over medium-high heat, combine the water, salt, vinegar, and red food coloring. Bring to a boil. Cut the sausage links into halves or thirds, depending on size, and place into a large sterile jar. Pour the hot vinegar mixture in with the sausage, secure the lid, and let stand for 2 days before serving.
