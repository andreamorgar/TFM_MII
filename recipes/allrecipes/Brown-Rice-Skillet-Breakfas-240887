Beat eggs, Cheddar cheese, and milk together with a fork in a large bowl. Place sausages in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer sausage to a work surface and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Heat olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until onion is slightly translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Gradually add spinach to onion mixture; cook and stir until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Add sausage pieces and cook until heated through, about 1 minute more. Slowly pour egg mixture into sausage mixture; cook and stir until eggs are set, 2 to 5 minutes. Stir rice, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper into eggs.
