Whisk banana, eggs, almond flour, almond butter, vanilla extract, cinnamon, baking soda, and baking powder together in a bowl until batter is smooth. Heat olive oil on a griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
