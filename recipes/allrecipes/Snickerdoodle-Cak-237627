Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 8-inch cake pans with shortening and dust with about 1 teaspoon flour, shaking to remove excess flour. Beat 1/2 cup butter in a bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add white sugar and beat until incorporated into the creamed butter. Add eggs, 1 at a time, to creamed butter mixture, beating until thoroughly combined before adding the next egg. Stir 1 teaspoon vanilla extract into creamed butter mixture. Whisk flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Gradually beat 1/3 the flour mixture into butter mixture, alternating with the 3/4 cup milk and ending with flour mixture until batter is smooth. Pour batter into the prepared cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven until cake is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Turn cakes onto a wire rack to cool completely, at least 30 minutes. Beat 1/2 cup butter in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; beat in 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and honey. Gradually beat enough confectioners' sugar into creamed butter mixture to reach desired consistency, adding 1 tablespoon milk if needed to thin the icing. Spread 1/3 the icing over the top of 1 cake using a spatula. Place the second cake over the icing layer and spread remaining icing over entire cake.
