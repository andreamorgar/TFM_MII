Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Layer ham into a 2-quart casserole dish. Bring water to a boil in a saucepan. Slowly pour grits into the water while stirring constantly. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the grits are tender and thick, 3 to 4 minutes. Mix Cheddar cheese and butter into grits. Whisk milk, eggs, salt, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl; stir in rosemary and garlic. Pour grit mixture over ham. Cover casserole dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling, about 45 minutes.
