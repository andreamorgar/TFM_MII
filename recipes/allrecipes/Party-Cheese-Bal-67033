Combine the cream cheese and Cheddar cheese in a bowl; use your hands to mix together. Add the pimento, green pepper, onion, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, and salt; mix, and shape into a ball. Spread the pecans onto a plate. Roll the cheese ball in the pecans until evenly coated. Refrigerate overnight before serving.
