Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Make a small slit into one end of each cocktail wiener to resemble a toenail. Cut the tortillas into strips 4 inches long by 1 inch wide, and place onto a microwave safe plate. Cook the tortillas in the microwave a few seconds until pliable. Wrap each sausage with a strip of tortilla, and secure with a toothpick. Make sure the toenail side is sticking out. Place the mummy toes onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven, and allow to cool slightly. Place a squirt of ketchup or mustard where the wedge is to resemble a bloody toenail, or of course an infected toenail. Serve to unsuspecting guests.
