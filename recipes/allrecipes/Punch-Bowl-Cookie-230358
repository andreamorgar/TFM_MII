Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl until creamy and smooth; scoop by teaspoonful onto the prepared baking sheet. Make an indentation in the center of each portion and insert a cherry half. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are light brown, about 12 minutes.
