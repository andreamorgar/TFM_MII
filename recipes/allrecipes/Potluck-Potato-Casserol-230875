Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Mix Cheddar cheese, potato soup, sour cream, cream cheese, green onions, garlic, and salt together in a large bowl. Fold potatoes into the mixture; pour prepared casserole dish. Top with Parmesan cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and cheese is golden brown, about 1 hour.
