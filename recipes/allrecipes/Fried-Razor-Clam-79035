Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. In a bowl, mix crushed crackers with black pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. Place eggs in a separate bowl. Dip clams into eggs, then into cracker mixture to evenly coat. Fry clams in the hot oil until golden brown. Do not over cook.
