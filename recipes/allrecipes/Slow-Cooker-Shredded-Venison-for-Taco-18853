Mix half the taco seasoning with the flour and cayenne pepper to taste and coat the meat with this mixture. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Place the roast in the oil and brown well on all sides. Place the meat in a slow cooker with the water and cook on low setting for 8 hours or on high setting for 5 hours. When meat is done, shred with a fork and season to your taste.
