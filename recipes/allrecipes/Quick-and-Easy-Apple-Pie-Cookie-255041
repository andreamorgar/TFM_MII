Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Sift flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and baking powder together in a bowl. Mix brown sugar and egg together in a bowl; stir in apples, cinnamon, and cloves. Blend softened butter into the apple mixture with a fork. Slowly stir flower mixture into the apple mixture until combined. Spoon batter onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly brown, about 12 minutes.
