Whisk soy milk, turbinado sugar, molasses, vanilla extract, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, and nutmeg together in a saucepan over medium-low heat until well incorporated, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk in flour until smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Fold raisins and walnuts into soy milk mixture; add carrots. Cook and stir pudding over low heat, keeping just below a boil, until carrots are softened, 30 minutes.
