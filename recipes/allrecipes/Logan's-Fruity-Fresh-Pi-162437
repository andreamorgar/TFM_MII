Whisk the milk and vanilla pudding together in a bowl for 2 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes to begin to set. Toss the banana and strawberries in a separate bowl with the lemon juice. Gently fold in the blackberries, blueberries, yogurt, and pudding. Pour into the prepared graham cracker crust and sprinkle with marshmallows to serve.
