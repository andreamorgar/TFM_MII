Place the potatoes in a saucepan of lightly salted water, bring to a boil, and cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes in a colander, and let cool. Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Snip the cooked bacon into pieces with a scissors, or chop. In a large bowl, mix the mini potatoes, chopped bacon, hard-boiled eggs, broccoli, Cheddar cheese, ranch salad dressing, dill weed, salt, and pepper until thoroughly combined, and serve.
