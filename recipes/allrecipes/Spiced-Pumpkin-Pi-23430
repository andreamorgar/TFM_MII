Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together the pumpkin, egg substitute, brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice and nonfat evaporated milk. Pour the pumpkin mixture into the pie crust. Bake in the preheated oven 1 hour, or until a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean.
