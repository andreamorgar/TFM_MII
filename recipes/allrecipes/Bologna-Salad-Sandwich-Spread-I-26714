Place eggs in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from water, cool and peel. In a food processor, place eggs, bologna and sweet pickles. Blend to a spreadable consistency. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl. Mix in mayonnaise, increasing the amount as necessary to make the mixture smooth. Cover and chill in the refrigerator until serving.
