Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare a baking dish with cooking spray. Preheat the baking dish in the oven. Brown the sausage in a skillet over medium heat; drain. Mix the flour, white sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Stir in the eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla to form a batter. Add the sausage and stir. Pour into the preheated baking dish. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the dish comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Allow to cool 10 minutes before cutting to serve.
