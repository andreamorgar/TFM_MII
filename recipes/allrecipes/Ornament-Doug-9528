Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Combine the flour, salt and water; mix well and knead for 10 minutes. Roll out on a lightly floured surface. Cut into desired shapes and make holes for hanging. Bake for 30 minutes; allow to cool. Decorate with poster paints or tube paints. Allow to dry and spray with clear polyurethane on both sides to preserve. Use ribbon or yarn pieces to hang.
