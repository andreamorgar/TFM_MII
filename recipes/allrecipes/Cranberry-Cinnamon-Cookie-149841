Sift together the flour and cinnamon in a bowl. Cream together the butter and sugar in a separate bowl. Mix in 1 egg thoroughly, then mix in the second egg. Slowly stir the flour mixture into the butter mixture. Stir in the cranberries. Roll the dough into a log with a diameter of about 1 1/2 inches; wrap in plastic; place in freezer for at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut the cookie dough into 1/2-inch-thick slices using a sharp knife. Arrange the cookies onto a large baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until edges turn brown, about 10 minutes.
