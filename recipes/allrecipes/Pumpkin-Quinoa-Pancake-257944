Mix quinoa flour, brown sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, allspice, salt, and ginger together in a large bowl. Whisk buttermilk, pumpkin puree, eggs, and oil together in a separate bowl. Pour over quinoa flour mixture; stir just until batter is blended. Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat; spray with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cup batter into the skillet. Cook until bubbles form and edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until the center springs back when pressed, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
