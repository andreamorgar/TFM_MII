Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir cookie crumbs and butter together in a bowl. Press crumb mixture into the bottom of an 8-inch springform pan. Bake in the preheated oven until browned and set, about 10 minutes; cool completely. Heat 2/3 cup cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until just barely bubbling, 3 to 4 minutes. Place white chocolate in a bowl and pour hot cream over the chocolate. Whisk until white chocolate melts and mixture is smooth. Cool to room temperature. Beat 1 1/2 cups cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Add vanilla extract and continue to beat until stiff peaks form. Puree 2/3 pound strawberries in a blender or food processor. Fold 1/2 the whipped cream into the cooled white chocolate mixture. Fold white chocolate mixture into remaining whipped cream. Add the strawberry puree and fold until just combined. Spoon strawberry mixture on top of the crumb crust in the springform pan. Top with chopped strawberries. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours.
