Melt the chocolate chips in a heavy saucepan over very low heat. Stir to evenly melt. Cream together the butter and sugars until light. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Stir in the melted chocolate and vanilla. In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and baking soda. Add to the butter mixture slowly. Blend thoroughly. Shape into 1-inch balls and place on a greased cookie sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) for 12 to 14 minutes. Let sit on cookie sheet for a minute or two before removing to a rack to cool.
