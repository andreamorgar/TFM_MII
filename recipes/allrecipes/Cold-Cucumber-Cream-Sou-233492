Heat oil in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir cucumbers, chicken broth, dill weed, salt, and pepper into onions. Cover saucepan and simmer for 20 minutes. Pour cucumber soup mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Pour pureed soup into a container, and whisk in heavy cream. Season with salt and ground black pepper to taste. Refrigerate soup until completely chilled, at least 1 hour.
