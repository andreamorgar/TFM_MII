Heat water and chocolate in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly, until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth, about 5 minutes. Stir sugar and salt into chocolate mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved and flavors combine, about 4 minutes. Pour milk into chocolate mixture and cook until hot. Beat with a whisk until foamy or stir until smooth.
