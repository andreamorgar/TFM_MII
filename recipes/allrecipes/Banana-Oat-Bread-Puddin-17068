In a large bowl, break bread into small pieces. Add oats and milk; stir. Let stand for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8 inch baking pan. To the milk mixture add: butter, bananas, brown sugar and raisins (if desired). Stir just to combine and pour into prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45-55 minutes, or until pudding has set. Cool before serving.
