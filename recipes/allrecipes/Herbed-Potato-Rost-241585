Shred the unpeeled potatoes using a food processor or box grater. Squeeze all the water out of the potatoes. Toss the potatoes with half of each the parsley and green onion, the rosemary, pepper and salt until well combined. Divide the mixture into four equal portions. Heat half the butter in a large, nonstick skillet set over high heat. When the butter foams, add the potato mixture and, using a silicone spatula, form into 4 individual disks of equal thickness. Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 4 to 5 minutes or until underside is set and a golden crust forms. Add the remaining butter and gently turn rosti; cook for an additional 5 minutes or until the rosti are golden brown and bubbles are actively forming in the centre of each disk. Drain on paper towel. Meanwhile combine sour cream with remaining parsley, green onion and mustard. Serve with warm rosti.
