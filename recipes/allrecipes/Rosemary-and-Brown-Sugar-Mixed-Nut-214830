Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Spread the mixed nuts into a single layer on the lined baking sheet. Roast the nuts in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Sprinkle the rosemary and salt over the roasted nuts. Mix the butter and brown sugar together in a large bowl; add the nuts and toss to coat evenly. Spread the nuts again into an even layer on the lined baking sheet to serve.
