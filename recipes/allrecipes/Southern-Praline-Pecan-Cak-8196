Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9 or 10 inch Bundt pan with non-stick cooking spray. Combine the cake mix with the frosting, eggs, oil, water and 1/2 of the pecan pieces. Mix until combined. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 of pecans in the prepared Bundt pan then pour in the cake batter. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.
