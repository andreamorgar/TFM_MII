Beat in egg yolks, vanilla, and salt. Gradually mix in flour. Shape dough into 3/4 inch balls. Dip in lightly beaten egg whites, then roll in finely chopped walnuts. Place 1 inch apart on prepared cookie sheets. Press down center of each with thumb. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes, or until golden brown.
