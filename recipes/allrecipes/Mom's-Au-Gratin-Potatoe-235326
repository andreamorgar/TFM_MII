Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and cool. Peel and slice potatoes into thin rounds. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Saute green onions in hot butter until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir sour cream, condensed chicken soup, Cheddar cheese, and salt into onion mixture until completely combined. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Arrange potato slices in the bottom of an 8x8-inch baking pan. Pour cheese sauce over potatoes. Bake in the preheated oven until brown around the edges, about 45 minutes.
