Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8-inch springform pan. Combine graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 cup melted butter, and 1/3 cup white sugar in a bowl until well mixed; press into the prepared springform pan. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Beat cream cheese and ricotta cheese together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until creamy and smooth, about 3 minutes. Add 1 1/2 cup white sugar; beat on low speed until well blended, about 2 minutes. Stir 1/2 cup melted butter, cornstarch, flour, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla extract into cream cheese mixture until combined. Gently stir eggs, 1 at a time, into mixture; fold in sour cream just until batter is mixed. Pour batter over the crust. Pour strawberry pie filling over the batter. Gently swirl strawberry pie filling into batter using a butter knife just enough to form a swirl pattern on the top. Bake in the preheated oven without opening the door for 1 hour 15 minutes. Turn off oven and leave cheesecake in the oven for 1 hour more. Remove cheesecake form oven and cool on a wire rack for 2 hours. Cover and refrigerate cheesecake, 6 hours to overnight. Remove springform and slice.
