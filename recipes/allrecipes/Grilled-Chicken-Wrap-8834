Slit open each chicken breast. Cut each sausage link in half lengthways, then cut to the length of the chicken breast. Place a halved sausage link inside each chicken breast, then add jalapeno peppers to taste, onion and garlic and seal the chicken with toothpicks. Season the outside of each chicken breast with Cajun spices/seasoning. Wrap each breast with 2 slices of bacon and secure with toothpicks. Place on a barbecue grill over medium coals and grill until done, about 30 minutes each side. Enjoy!
