Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook and stir bacon and onion in a skillet over medium heat until the bacon is crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain grease, reserving the drippings. Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with the reserved bacon grease. Combine the cooked bacon and onion, eggs, hash brown potatoes, Cheddar cheese, cottage cheese, Swiss cheese, bell pepper, and green chilies in the prepared baking dish; stir to combine. Bake in preheated oven until the eggs are set firm, 35 to 40 minutes. Let casserole cool 10 minutes before cutting to serve.
