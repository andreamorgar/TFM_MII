Heat a griddle over medium heat. Whisk rice flour, sorghum flour, amaranth, baking powder, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Stir almond milk, applesauce, and egg into flour mixture until batter is just combined. Spray griddle with cooking spray. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
