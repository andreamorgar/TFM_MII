In a mixing bowl, cream sugar and butter or margarine until fluffy. Add egg and egg white; beat well. Stir together flours, soda, and salt; beat into creamed mixture. In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons sugar and cinnamon. Shape dough into walnut sized balls, and roll in cinnamon sugar. Place 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 8 to 10 minutes. Cookies will puff up and flatten as they bake. Cool on wire racks.
