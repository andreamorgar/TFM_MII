Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. In a medium bowl, stir together the eggs, sugar, and oil. Combine the flour baking soda and salt, stir into the egg mixture. Finally, stir in the baby food. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Cool and frost with your favorite cream cheese frosting.
