Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease the bottom of a shallow baking pan. Unroll the prepared pie crust onto a lightly floured surface, and cut into 1/2 inch wide strips. Place peach stem side down, and wrap strips of dough--over-lapping rows--around the fruit so it's completely covered. For ease, twirl the peach while holding the pastry in place and overlap rows. When completely wrapped, the peach will resemble a beehive. Make sure the entire peach is covered and sealed inside the crust. Repeat with remaining peaches. Arrange the wrapped peaches in a shallow baking pan. Bake peaches in preheated oven until crust turns golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes. Meanwhile, cream butter with 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the vanilla extract, allspice, salt, and heavy cream until well blended. Stir in the remaining 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar. To serve, place baked peaches in serving bowls. Slice each peach in half and remove the pits. Spoon hard sauce over the peach halves.
