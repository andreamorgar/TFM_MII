Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch baking dish. Beat egg whites in a large bowl with an electric mixer until stiff. Combine egg yolks and white sugar in another large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add butter and vanilla extract; beat until smooth, about 2 minutes. Fold in flour. Beat in milk slowly. Fold egg whites gently into the batter. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden, 45 to 70 minutes. Let cool, about 30 minutes. Dust top with confectioners' sugar.
