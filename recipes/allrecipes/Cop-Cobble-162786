Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish, and set aside. Tear the doughnuts into bite-size pieces, and place them in a large bowl. Pour in the sweetened condensed milk, eggs, peaches with juice, cinnamon, and salt, and mix. Spoon the mixture into the greased baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour, until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. While the cobbler is baking, make a glaze by combining the melted butter, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Stir until smooth. Drizzle the glaze over the baked cobbler.
