Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Mix rolled oats, flax seed meal, steel-cut oats, oat bran, wheat germ, and pecans in a large bowl. Whisk agave nectar, pumpkin, brown sugar, water, canola oil, vanilla extract, pumpkin pie spice, and sea salt in a separate bowl, stirring until brown sugar and salt are dissolved. Pour liquid ingredients over rolled oats mixture and stir to coat. Spread mixture on prepared baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour, stirring every 20 minutes. Stir dates into granola and continue baking until granola is lightly golden brown, 20 to 30 more minutes, stirring once. Let cool completely and mix miniature chocolate chips into granola. Store in an airtight container.
