In a large bowl, combine the pudding mix with 2 cups of milk, following package directions; allow to chill for 5 minutes. To the pudding stir in the rum flavoring and nutmeg, then slowly mix in the remaining 4 cups of milk until the mixture is a thick but drinkable consistency. Chill until ready to serve.
