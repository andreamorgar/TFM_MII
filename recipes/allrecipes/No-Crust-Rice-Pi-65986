Prepare the vanilla pudding according to package directions using the milk. Set aside to cool slightly. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, beat the eggs, sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy. Stir in the cooked rice, vanilla pudding and ricotta cheese until smooth. Pour into a 9 inch deep dish pie plate or 10 inch pie plate. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until the center appears set when the pie is gently jiggled. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until chilled before slicing and serving.
