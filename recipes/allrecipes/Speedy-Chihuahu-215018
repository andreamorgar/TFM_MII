Rub a lime wedge around the rims of 3 margarita glasses, and dip each glass rim into salt. Place ice cubes into each glass. Mix together the tequila, orange liqueur, lime juice, and grapefruit juice into a pitcher, and pour into the glasses over the ice. Add 1 splash of club soda to each glass, and serve.
