Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together the oats, brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon. Stir in the melted shortening and water to form a crumbly mixture. In a large saucepan, mix together the cranberry sauce and cornstarch. Bring to a boil, and then remove from heat. Stir in the apples. Spread into an 8x8 inch glass baking dish. Crumble the oat mixture over the apples. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the apples are tender. Serve warm.
