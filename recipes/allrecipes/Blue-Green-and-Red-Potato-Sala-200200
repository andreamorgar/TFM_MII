Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and allow to cool to room temperature. Cut potatoes into bite size pieces and return to bowl. Stir in the blue cheese, apples, green onions, and celery. Mix in the sour cream and mayonnaise; season with salt and pepper to taste.
