Stir the orange juice, pineapple juice, simple syrup, coconut-flavored rum, 151 proof rum, grenadine syrup, and fruit-flavored liqueur together in a 2-quart or larger pitcher. Refrigerate at least 2 hours, or overnight. Place 1 cup of crushed ice in each of eight 12-ounce glasses. Pour about 1 cup of the rum mixture into each glass, and garnish each with a maraschino cherry and an orange slice.
