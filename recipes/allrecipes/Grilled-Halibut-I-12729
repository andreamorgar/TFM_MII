Place halibut fillets in a shallow baking dish. In a bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lime juice, thyme, basil, oregano, and rosemary. Pour marinade over fish, cover, and refrigerate 2 to 4 hours. Preheat grill for medium heat. Adjust grate height to between 4 and 6 inches from heat source. Lightly oil grill grate. Remove halibut from dish, and discard marinade. Cook for 5 minutes per side, or until fish can be easily flaked with a fork.
