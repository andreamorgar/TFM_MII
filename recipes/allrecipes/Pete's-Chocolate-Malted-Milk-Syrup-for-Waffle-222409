Warm heavy cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until little bubbles form around the edge. Reduce heat to low and whisk the malted milk powder into the cream. Fold the chocolate chips into the cream mixture. Heat, whisking frequently, until the chocolate melts completely into the mixture. Keep warm until serving.
