Cut each pork tenderloin into 4 pieces and place into a slow cooker; set to High. Stir onions, barbecue sauce, crushed tomatoes, diet soda, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, liquid smoke flavoring, paprika, red pepper flakes, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl; pour mixture over pork tenderloin pieces. Cover and cook until tenderloin pieces begin to shred at the edges, 3 to 4 hours. Shred meat using 2 forks; reduce slow cooker setting to Low and cook 1 more hour.
