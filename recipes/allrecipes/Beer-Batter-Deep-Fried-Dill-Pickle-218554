Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Whisk together the beer, 1 1/2 cups flour, pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, and seasoned salt in a large bowl. Dip the pickle slices into the beer batter, then coat them in the remaining 1 1/2 cups flour. Fry the pickles in the preheated oil until golden and crisp, about 5 minutes.
