Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10x15 inch jellyroll pan. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt 4 squares of chocolate with 1 cup butter. In a medium bowl, beat eggs and sugar with the melted chocolate mixture until well blended. Stir in the flour. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 17 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool in pan. To make the mint layer: Beat the confectioners' sugar with 3/8 cup of butter in a medium bowl. Gradually beat in milk, green food coloring and peppermint extract. Spread evenly over the brownie layer and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. To make the glaze: Melt 3 squares chocolate with 3 tablespoons butter over medium heat or in a microwave oven, stirring frequently until smooth. Spread over the mint layer when completely cool. Chill again to set before cutting into bars.
