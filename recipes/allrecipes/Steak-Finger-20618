Tenderize steak by pounding with a mallet. Cut into 3 inch long strips. Combine egg, milk, salt and pepper in a shallow dish, whisk until well blended. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat 1/3 cup oil (or just enough to cover the bottom of the pan). Coat steak pieces in flour. Shake off excess. Then dip in the egg mixture and again in flour. Fry the strips in the hot oil until golden brown; about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb oil.
