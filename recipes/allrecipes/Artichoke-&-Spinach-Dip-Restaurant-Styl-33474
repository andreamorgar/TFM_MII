Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place garlic in a small baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven 20 to 30 minutes, until soft. Remove from heat. When cool enough to touch, squeeze softened garlic from skins. In an 8x8 inch baking dish, spread the roasted garlic, spinach, artichoke hearts, Alfredo-style pasta sauce, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and cream cheese. Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until cheeses are melted and bubbly. Serve warm.
