Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the apples into an ungreased 7x11-inch baking dish and sprinkle them with the sugar and cinnamon. Stir to combine thoroughly. In a bowl, mix together the brown sugar, flour, and softened butter until well combined; sprinkle over the apples. Bake in the preheated oven for until the apples are bubbling and the topping is lightly browned, 45 to 60 minutes. Serve hot.
