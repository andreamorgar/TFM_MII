Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine cereal, salt, sugar and milk in top of double boiler, over, not in, simmering water. Simmer for 30 minutes, then remove from heat and stir in eggs and vanilla. Pour into 1 quart baking dish. Line a roasting pan with a damp kitchen towel. Place baking dish on towel, inside roasting pan, and place roasting pan on oven rack. Fill roasting pan with boiling water to reach halfway up the sides of the baking dish. Bake 30 minutes, until knife inserted in center comes out clean.
