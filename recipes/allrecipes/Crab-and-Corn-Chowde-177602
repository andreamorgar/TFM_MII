Cook the bacon in a 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat for 5 minutes or until the bacon is crisp. Remove the bacon with a fork or kitchen tongs and drain on paper towels. Crumble and set aside. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of drippings. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onions and garlic and cook in the hot bacon drippings until tender. Stir in the broth, seafood seasoning, potatoes and corn. Heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 15 minutes or until the potatoes are tender. Add the crabmeat and cream. Cook for 5 minutes. Divide the chowder among 6 serving bowls. Top each with about 1 tablespoon of bacon.
