Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Press pie crust pastry into a 9-inch pie pan. Combine crushed pineapple, sugar, coconut, margarine, eggs, and flour in a bowl; mix with a fork until well blended. Pour into pie crust pastry. Bake pie in the preheated oven until the middle is set and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
