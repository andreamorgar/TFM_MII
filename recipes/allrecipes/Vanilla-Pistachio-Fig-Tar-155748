Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray four 3 3/4 inch (9.5 centimeter) tart pans with cooking spray. In food processor, process nuts and vanilla bean to a fine texture. Sift flour and confectioner's sugar together, and add to nuts; pulse to combine. Add egg, egg white, butter, brandy, and lemon zest. Pulse to combine. Slice 6 figs into 3/4 inch (2 centimeter) thick slices, and stir into batter. Divide batter into tart pans. Cut remaining figs into thin slices, and arrange over batter in each tart pan. Bake until tarts are set and golden brown, about 40 minutes. When cool, sprinkle with additional confectioner's sugar.
