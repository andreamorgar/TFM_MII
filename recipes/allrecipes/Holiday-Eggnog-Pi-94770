Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix the sugar and flour together in a mixing bowl. Beat in the eggnog, eggs, and vanilla to make a smooth mixture. Stir in the butter. Pour into the prepared pie crust. Bake in preheated oven until the custard is set, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool before serving.
