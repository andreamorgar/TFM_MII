Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fill a large pot half-full with water; bring to a boil. Cook squash in the boiling water until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove squash from water and allow to cool. Cut about 1/2 inch from the top of each squash and remove the insides to hollow the squash. Set squash insides aside. Melt butter and oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add spinach and Worcestershire sauce; cook and stir until spinach is tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer spinach mixture to a bowl to partially cool. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Stir 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese and egg into spinach mixture; spoon into the hollowed squash. Arrange stuffed squash in a single layer on a baking sheet; top with remaining cheese. Pour enough hot water into pan to fill about 1/2-inch. Bake in the preheated oven until squash is tender, 25 to 30 minutes.
