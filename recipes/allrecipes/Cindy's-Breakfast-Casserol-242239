Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Arrange bacon slices in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until browned and crisp, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels and transfer 1 to 2 tablespoons bacon grease to a skillet, reserving the remaining bacon grease. Add butter to skillet. Cook and stir potatoes in the hot bacon grease-butter until lightly browned, about 10 minutes; season with salt and black pepper. Transfer potatoes to the prepared baking dish. Heat about 1 tablespoon reserved bacon grease in the skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Layer mushrooms over potatoes. Place green onions in the same skillet and remove from heat. Allow green onions to soften from the residual heat in skillet; layer over mushrooms. Crumble bacon over green onion layer; top with 1 cup Cheddar cheese. Blend eggs, milk, and 1 teaspoon salt in a blender until smooth; pour over Cheddar cheese layer. Top casserole with remaining 1 cup Cheddar cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is set and a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes.
