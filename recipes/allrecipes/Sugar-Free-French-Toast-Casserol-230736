Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Line bottom of prepared baking dish with bread cubes. Beat eggs, milk, 2 tablespoons sweetener, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; pour mixture over bread cubes. Let stand 10 minutes (or refrigerate up to overnight if desired). Combine remaining 2 tablespoons sweetener with remaining 1 teaspoon cinnamon; sprinkle mixture over the casserole. Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is set and topping is crunchy, 30 to 40 minutes.
