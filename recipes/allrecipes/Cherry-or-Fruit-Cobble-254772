Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking dish. Mix milk, 3/4 cup sugar, baking mix, butter, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish. Mix remaining 1/2 cup sugar with cherries in a bowl. Spoon on top of the batter in the baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes.
