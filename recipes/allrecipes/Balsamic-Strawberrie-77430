Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the strawberry halves, sucrolose sweetener, and balsamic vinegar. Cook until the strawberries are heated through and darkened to a ruby red. Place scoops of ice cream into dessert bowls or stemmed glasses. Spoon strawberries over the ice cream and serve.
