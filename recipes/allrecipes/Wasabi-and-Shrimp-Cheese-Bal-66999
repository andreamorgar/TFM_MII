In a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese, soy sauce, water chestnuts, shrimp, and 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds. Gradually stir in wasabi paste until you reach the desired amount of spice. Cover and refrigerate for one hour. Remove the cheese mixture from the refrigerator, and shape into a ball. Roll in the remaining sesame seeds to cover. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
