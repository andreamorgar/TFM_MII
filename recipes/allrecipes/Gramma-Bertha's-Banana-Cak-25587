Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 10 inch Bundt pan with non-stick cooking spray. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Beat in the sliced bananas, sour cream and baking soda. Beat in the flour. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
