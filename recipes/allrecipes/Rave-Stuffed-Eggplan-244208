Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Scoop flesh out of eggplants and chop the flesh, reserving the skins. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add chopped eggplant; cook and stir until eggplant is softened, about 5 minutes. Add spinach and cook until slightly wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir crushed croutons into eggplant mixture until evenly combined. Add remaining 1/4 cup olive oil, Parmesan-Romano cheese, salt, and black pepper; mix well. Place eggplant skins in a shallow baking dish and fill each with eggplant mixture. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over each stuffed eggplant. Pour enough hot water into baking dish to reach 1/8-inch up sides of eggplant. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and stuffing is cooked through, about 30 minutes.
