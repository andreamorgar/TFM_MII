Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare a glass baking dish with cooking spray. Mix apples, pears, raisins, and chia seeds in the baking dish. Drizzle apple cider and maple syrup over the fruit mixture and stir gently to coat. Mix oats, wheat germ, brown sugar, flax seed, flour, pumpkin pie spice, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Mash butter into the oats mixture with a fork until the mixture is uniform in texture; spread atop the fruit mixture. Cover the dish loosely with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is browned and crisp, 35 to 40 minutes.
