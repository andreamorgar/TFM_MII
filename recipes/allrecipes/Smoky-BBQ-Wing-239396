Remove tips from chicken wings and discard. Combine remaining ingredients in a bowl and stir until smooth, and divide the mixture in half. Put the chicken and half of the sauce in a resealable plastic bag, shake to coat well and place in the refrigerator from 3 hours to overnight. Reserve the remaining sauce in the refrigerator until ready to serve with wings. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the chicken from the marinade and place skin side down, in a shallow baking dish. Discard marinade. Bake for 50 minutes, flipping over half way through baking. Increase heat to broil and broil wings until crisped, about 3 minutes. Serve immediately with reserved dipping sauce.
