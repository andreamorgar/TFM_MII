In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar, sugar, salt, pepper, and poppy seeds, and set aside. Wash lettuce and tear into bite-sized pieces. To a large bowl, first add the lettuce, then the onions, water chestnuts, and chicken. Just before serving, top with the almonds, noodles and dressing, and toss lightly.
