Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with aluminum foil or baking parchment. Chop chocolates and mints. Place the chocolates and mints in the top part of a double boiler over medium heat. Stir occasionally until melted and set aside. In a large bowl, beat the butter until soft. Add vanilla and sugar and mix well. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Stir in the melted chocolate. Sift together the flour, cocoa, and baking soda. Add to mixture and stir until well blended. Drop by tablespoon at least 2 inches apart on cookie sheets. Bake 15 to 18 minutes until lightly colored. Let cool on wire racks.
