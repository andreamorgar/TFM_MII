Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare cookie sheets by lining with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, toss together the golden raisins and dark raisins with the whiskey; set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and butter. Add the eggs one at a time, mix until light and fluffy. Sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg; stir into the creamed mixture. Stir in the walnuts, pecans, cherries, and finally, the raisin and whiskey mixture. Drop cookies by rounded tablespoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to cool on wire racks.
