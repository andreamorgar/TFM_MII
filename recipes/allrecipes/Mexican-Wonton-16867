Place 1 to 2 teaspoons of shredded cheese into the center of each wonton skin. Fold the top and bottom corners in toward each other and roll it up like a little egg roll. You will have to seal the wonton with a little water where the ends meet. Heat oil in a deep pot to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C). Fry the wontons two or three at a time. Drain on paper towels. Serve immediately.
