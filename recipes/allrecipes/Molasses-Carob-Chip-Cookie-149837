Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 baking sheets. Place oats into the bowl of a food processor. Process until finely chopped. Pour ground oats back into measuring cup, and add more oats to make a full cup. Set aside. Place almonds and vegetable oil into the bowl of a food processor. Process until smooth and paste-like. Scrape almond mixture into a mixing bowl. Add the butter, molasses, turbinado sugar, and egg to the mixing bowl with the nut mixture; beat ingredients together until well blended. Stir in baking soda, oats, whole wheat flour, coconut, and carob chips, and blend thoroughly. Drop by teaspoonfuls 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until tops set and look dry, about 7 minutes. Remove from oven and transfer to racks to cool.
