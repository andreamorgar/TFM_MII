Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish with cooking spray. Combine oats, walnuts, 1/2 of the blueberries, maple syrup, cinnamon, and baking powder in a large bowl. Whisk milk, egg, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Spread oat mixture in the baking dish and pour milk mixture over the top. Shake the dish slightly to help milk sink into the oats. Add remaining blueberries and banana slices. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool before slicing, 10 to 15 minutes.
