Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch cake pan. Combine milk, sugar, cornmeal, eggs, butter, all-purpose flour, and baking powder in a blender; mix until very smooth, about 5 minutes. Pour into the prepared cake pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Let cool before cutting and serving.
