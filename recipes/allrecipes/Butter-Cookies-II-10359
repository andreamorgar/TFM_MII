Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt butter or margarine over low heat. Remove from heat and add 4 cups of flour and the sugar. Beat eggs in one at a time until it is all blended. Slowly add in the remaining 4 cups of flour. Roll out the dough on a floured area to a thickness of about an 1/4 of an inch. Cut cookies using cookie cutters and place the cut outs about 1 inch apart on the cookie sheet. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until brown on the edges.
