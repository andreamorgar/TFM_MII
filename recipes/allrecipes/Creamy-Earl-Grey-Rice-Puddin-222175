Combine water and tea bag in a saucepan. Bring water to a boil. Remove and discard the tea bag. Stir rice into boiling water, reduce heat to low, cover the saucepan, and cook until the moisture is absorbed into the rice and the rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Transfer the cooked rice to a clean saucepan. Pour 1 cup skim milk and agave syrup over the cooked rice; season with kosher salt. Place the saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until the mixture is thick and creamy, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir 1/2 cup milk, egg, and raisins into the rice mixture; simmer another 2 minutes while stirring. Remove from heat. Stir butter and vanilla extract into the rice mixture until the butter melts.
