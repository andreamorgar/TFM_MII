Break up chocolate almond bars and place in a medium saucepan with marshmallows and milk. Place over medium-high heat and stir frequently until chocolate and marshmallows are melted and mixture is smooth. Remove from heat and allow to cool. In a medium bowl, whip cream until soft peaks form. Fold into cooled chocolate mixture. Gently stir in vanilla extract. Pour mixture into crust. Chill before serving.
