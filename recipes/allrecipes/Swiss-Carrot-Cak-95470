Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch square baking dish or 9 inch Bundt pan. In a large bowl, whip egg yolks and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Stir in the almonds, carrots,1 lemon's juice and zest, flour and baking powder. In a separate bowl with a clean beater, whip egg whites with a pinch of salt until they can hold a peak. Fold egg whites into the carrot batter. Pour into the prepared cake pan. Bake for 50 minutes, or until a small knife inserted into the center comes out clean. For icing, mix the remaining lemon's juice with confectioners' sugar until it can be drizzled easily from a spoon. Pour over the cake while warm or cooled. If making in a Bundt pan, remove from the pan before glazing.
