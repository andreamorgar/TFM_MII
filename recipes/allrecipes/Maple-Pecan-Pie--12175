Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spread the nuts evenly over pie shell. Mix together butter or margarine, vanilla, and flour. Beat the eggs well, and blend into the flour mixture. Add salt, maple syrup, and cream. Pour filling over the nuts in the pie shell. Make sure the nuts are covered, so they will not burn. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until knife inserted in center come out clean. Let cool at least 15 minutes before serving.
