Melt butter in a small saucepan; simmer garlic slices in hot butter over low heat until butter turns foamy, about 5 minutes. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Place bread loaf halves under the preheated broiler to toast, 2 to 4 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent burning. Slice toasted bread into 2-inch thick slices. Dip toasted side of each slice into garlic butter.
