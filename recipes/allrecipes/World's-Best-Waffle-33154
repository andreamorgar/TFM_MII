Preheat a lightly greased waffle iron. In a large bowl, mix flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt. In a medium bowl, beat together egg yolks, milk, vanilla, and vegetable oil. Blend into the flour mixture to form a batter. In a medium bowl, whip egg whites with sugar until soft peaks form. Fold into the batter. Spray waffle iron with non-stick cooking spray, or lightly brush with oil. Ladle the batter onto preheated waffle iron. Cook the waffles until golden and crisp. Serve immediately.
