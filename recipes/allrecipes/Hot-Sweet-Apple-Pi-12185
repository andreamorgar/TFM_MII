Peel, core, and thinly slice the apples. Mix the apples with the white sugar, 4 tablespoons cinnamon, and vanilla. Add the water. When the apples are well coated, place in the pie shell. Combine the brown sugar with the almonds and the remaining 4 tablespoons cinnamon. Sprinkle on top of the pie. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
