Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread pumpkin seeds, walnuts, almonds, oats, coconut, cacao nibs, and flaxseed meal in a single layer on the baking sheet. Bake pumpkin seed mixture in the preheated oven until toasted and fragrant, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool completely, about 15 minutes. Lower oven temperature 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray a 9x12-inch baking dish with cooking spray and line with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on 2 sides. Spray parchment paper with cooking spray. Mix cooled pumpkin seed mixture, dried fruit, mini chocolate chips, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Pour in brown rice syrup; mix well to combine. Pour into the prepared pan and press into an even layer with the back of a spoon or a small piece of parchment paper. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned on the edges, 17 to 20 minutes. Cool on a baking rack for 20 minutes. Slice into bars.
