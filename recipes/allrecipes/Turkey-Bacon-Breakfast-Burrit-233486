Heat oil in skillet over medium heat. Add eggs to skillet. Cook, pulling cooked portion to the center. Add bacon and continue cooking until eggs are firm. Remove from heat. To assemble burritos, evenly portion heated beans down center of each tortilla. Top beans with egg mixture, cheese, avocado and cilantro. Fold in opposite sides of each tortilla, and then roll up, burrito-style. Cut diagonally in half and serve with salsa and sour cream
