Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat white sugar, brown sugar, eggs, butter, shortening, baking soda, cinnamon, vanilla extract, salt, baking powder, and nutmeg together in a bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth; stir in oats, apples, and flour until dough is evenly combined. Drop dough by rounded tablespoons, about 2 inches apart, onto baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned, 9 to 11 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool, 3 to 5 minutes.
