Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, cream the butter. Blend in prosciutto, Parmesan cheese and ground black pepper. Place baguettes on a medium baking sheet. Heat in the preheated oven until lightly toasted, about 10 minutes. Spread baguette slices with the butter mixture. Arrange on a large serving platter. Sprinkle with pine nuts.
