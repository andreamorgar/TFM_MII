Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium bowl, combine potato soup, mixed vegetables, milk, thyme, and black pepper. Spoon filling into bottom pie crust. Cover with top crust, and crimp edges to seal. Slit top crust, and brush with beaten egg if desired. Bake for 40 minutes. Remove from oven, and cool for 10 minutes before serving.
