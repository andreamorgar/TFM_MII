In a large skillet over medium heat, fry bacon until crisp and drain on paper towels; crumble and set aside. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and add to cooked mushrooms. Meanwhile, saute mushrooms in about 1 tablespoon of bacon drippings and remove from heat. Add the cheese cubes and beaten eggs; toss until the cheese is melted and the eggs have coated the noodles. Sprinkle in the crumbled bacon and stir; serve.
