Break eggs into mixing bowl. Stir in water, garlic powder, mayonnaise, white wine, salt and pepper. Mix well with a wire whisk. Stir in cheddar cheese. Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat. Pour in egg mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until well cooked. The eggs should be firm, but not hard. These eggs will have a softer texture than normal scrambled eggs. Serve warm.
