Combine peaches, 2/3 cup white sugar, brown sugar, water, 1/2 cup margarine, and cinnamon together in a large skillet; bring to a boil. Cover skillet with a lid and cook peach mixture until sugars have dissolved and peaches are softened, about 10 minutes. Mix flour, 1/3 cup white sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Cut 3 tablespoons margarine into flour mixture until mixture is crumbly; add milk and stir until you have a soft dough. Drop tablespoons of the dough into the peach mixture. Cover skillet tightly with a lid and cook, without removing lid, until dumplings are cooked through, about 15 minutes.
