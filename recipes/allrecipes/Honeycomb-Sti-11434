Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (100 degrees C). Trim crusts from bread. Cut bread slices into 1/2 inch wide sticks. Bake the bread sticks in the oven for 2 hours. Remove from pan to cool. Melt peanut butter and oil together until melted. Drizzle in honey, stirring until well blended. Dip each baked stick in the peanut butter mixture. Roll each stick in the cornflake crumbs. Place the coated breadsticks on wax paper to set. Layer the sticks on top of each other in a container, separating the layers with wax paper. Freeze the cookies. Serve them direct from the freezer.
