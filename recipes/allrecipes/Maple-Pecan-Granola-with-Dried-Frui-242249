Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Mix oats, pecans, and almonds together in a bowl. Whisk oil, maple syrup, and water together in a measuring cup and pour over oat mixture; stir until evenly coated. Spread oat mixture onto 2 baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven for 12 minutes; stir and continue baking for 12 minutes more. Stir and bake until granola is golden brown, about 12 minutes more. Cool to room temperature. Mix cinnamon and cardamom together in a container with a lid; add dates, raisins, and cranberries. Cover container and shake until fruit is coated. Stir dried fruit into cooled granola.
