Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place peaches and berries in a colander for about 15 minutes to drain any excess fluid , then transfer to a large bowl. Gently toss with sugar, flour, and cinnamon. Transfer to a pie crust. Dot with butter, and top with remaining crust. Cut vents in top crust, and sprinkle with coarse sugar. Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until crust is golden brown.
