Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix the butter, flour, and pecans in a bowl, and press into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake 10 to 15 minutes; do not allow to brown. Set aside until completely cool. In a bowl, mix the cream cheese and confectioners' sugar until smooth. Blend in the whipped topping. Spread over the cooled crust. Refrigerate 8 hours, or overnight. Top with strawberries and drizzle with glaze to serve.
