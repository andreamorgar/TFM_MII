Beat milk and pudding mix together in a bowl until well blended and slightly thickened; let stand to thicken, about 5 minutes. Stir whipped topping and 1/2 of the crushed cookies into pudding. Spoon 1 tablespoon crushed cookies into each serving cup. Fill each cup 3/4-full with pudding mixture and top with remaining crushed cookies. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
