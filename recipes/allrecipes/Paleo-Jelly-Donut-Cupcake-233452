Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners. Blend applesauce, coconut oil, eggs, honey, and vanilla extract in a food processor or using an immersion blender. Transfer mixture to a large bowl; stir in coconut flour, salt, and baking soda until batter is solid, yet easily spooned. Thin mixture with almond milk if needed. Fill prepared muffin cups about 2/3-full with batter; spoon and swirl raspberry jam into each cup. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a cupcake comes out clean, about 25 minutes.
