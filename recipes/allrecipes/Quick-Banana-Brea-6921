Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease the bottom of a 9 x 5 inch loaf pan. Measure oil, bananas, vanilla, eggs, baking mix, sugar, and nuts into a large bowl. Beat vigorously with a spoon for about 30 seconds. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean, about 55 to 65 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes in the pan. Loosen sides of loaf from the pan. Remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
