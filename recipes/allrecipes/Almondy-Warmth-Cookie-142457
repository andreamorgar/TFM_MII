Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet. Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Set aside. Cream together brown sugar, white sugar, and vegetable oil spread in a medium bowl. Stir in sour cream, olive oil, almond extract, amaretto and bourbon, blending well after each addition. Gradually stir flour mixture into sugar mixture until well blended. Stir in almonds if desired. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto prepared cookie sheet. Bake until just crisp around the edges, 12 to 14 minutes.
