In a large microwave-safe bowl, melt chocolate and peanut butter chips for about 3 minutes on high. Stir every 30 seconds after the first minute until chips are melted and smooth. Slightly crush the potato chips before stirring into the mixture along with the peanuts. Drop by spoonfuls onto waxed paper and let stand until chocolate is set, about 15 minutes. Store at room temperature or in the refrigerator.
