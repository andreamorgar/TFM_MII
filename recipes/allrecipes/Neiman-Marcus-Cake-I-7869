Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 13x9 inch baking pan. Combine the yellow cake mix, 2 of the eggs, and the butter or margarine mix well. The batter should be stiff. Spread the batter into the prepared pan. Combine the cream cheese, confectioners' sugar and the remaining 2 eggs. Mix well and pour over the top of the cake batter. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 minutes.
