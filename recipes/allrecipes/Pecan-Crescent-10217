Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (170 degrees C). Cream butter or margarine, gradually adding confectioners' sugar and salt. Cream until light and fluffy. Stir in pecans and vanilla. Add flour gradually. Mix well. Shape dough into crescents using a teaspoon full for each crescent. Place on ungreased cookie sheet and bake 15-30 minutes. Do not brown. Let cool slightly, then roll cookies in additional confectioners' sugar.
