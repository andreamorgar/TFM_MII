Place water in a medium saucepan, and stir in the rice. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes. Remove from heat, cool slightly, and fluff with a fork. Heat the sesame oil in a separate medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in tofu. Stirring occasionally, fry about 20 minutes, until evenly crisp and lightly browned. Season with salt. In a small saucepan, bring the coconut milk to a boil. Mix in green curry paste. Reduce heat, and simmer 5 minutes. Drizzle generously over the tofu and rice to serve.
