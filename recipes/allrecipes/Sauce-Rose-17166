In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-low heat and add basil, thyme, oregano, parsley and dried red pepper flakes; stir together. Add onion, bell pepper and garlic and cook until onions are transparent; add tomato sauce and bring to a boil, stirring well. Add chicken bouillon and sugar; stir. While the sauce is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook according to the package instructions (fresh tortellini take less time than dried). Drain and set aside. Reduce heat, add cream and wine; bring close to a boil, stirring constantly. Add pasta and serve.
