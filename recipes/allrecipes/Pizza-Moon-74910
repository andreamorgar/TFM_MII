Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Unroll crescents onto work surface. Top each piece of dough with shredded cheese and a few slices of pepperoni. Sprinkle on a bit more cheese, and roll into crescent shape. Place pizza "moons" on a baking sheet. Bake until crescents are golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
