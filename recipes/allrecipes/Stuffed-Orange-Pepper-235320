Bring a large pot of water to a boil; cook orange bell peppers until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Drain. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir turkey and onion in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir tomatoes, rice, 1/2 cup water, and liquid smoke into turkey mixture; cover skillet and simmer until rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove skillet from heat; stir Gouda cheese into turkey mixture. Stuff each orange bell pepper with turkey mixture and place peppers, open-side up, in a baking dish. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese is melted, 25 to 35 minutes.
