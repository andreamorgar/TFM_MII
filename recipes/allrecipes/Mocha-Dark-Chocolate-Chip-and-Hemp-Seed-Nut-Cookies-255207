Preheat oven to 345 degrees F (174 degrees C). Combine flaxseed meal, butter, eggs, brown sugar, white sugar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Stir in oat flour, pudding mix, and baking soda gradually. Fold chocolate chips and hemp seed nuts into the dough. Scoop dough onto ungreased baking sheets with a cookie scoop. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, 11 to 13 minutes. Flatten with a fork if desired.
