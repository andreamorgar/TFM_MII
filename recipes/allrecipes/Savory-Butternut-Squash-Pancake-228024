Hydrate shallots with hot water in a small bowl, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain. Sift flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. Whisk eggs, squash, shallots, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture until just mixed. Fold currants into batter. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Scoop about 1/4 cup batter and drop into hot oil. Cook pancakes until crisp and lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining batter. Mix sour cream, vanilla extract, and maple syrup together in a bowl. Serve atop the squash pancakes.
