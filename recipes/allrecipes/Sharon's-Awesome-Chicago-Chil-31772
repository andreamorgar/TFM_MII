Place the ground beef in a large pot and cook over medium heat until evenly brown. Drain off the excess fat. Mix in the kidney beans, diced tomatoes, beer, chili sauce, onion, garlic, chili seasoning, black pepper, garlic powder, onion, cayenne pepper, oregano, sugar, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for about 4 hours, stirring occasionally.
