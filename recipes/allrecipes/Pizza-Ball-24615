Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet. In a medium bowl, mix together Italian sausage, baking mix, green bell pepper, yellow onion, mozzarella cheese and pizza sauce. Gradually stir in water until the mixture is a workable consistency. Roll into 1 inch balls. Arrange pizza balls on the baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven 20 minutes, or until lightly browned. Serve hot.
