Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. Spread the pizza dough in the prepared pan, and rub dough lightly with the olive oil. Stir together the ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, spinach, artichoke hearts, garlic, salt, and pepper. Spread the mixture evenly over the dough. Sprinkle evenly with the shredded Italian cheese; top with the sliced tomatoes. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned and the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 20 minutes.
