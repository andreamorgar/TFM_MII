Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugar. Mix in egg, apple butter, yogurt and vanilla. In a medium bowl, mix together flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking powder and salt. Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Divide batter between 18 standard muffin tins prepared with paper liners. Bake 25-27 minutes or until cooked through. Transfer to rack and allow to cool completely before frosting. Using a mixer, whip butter and cream cheese for 2 minutes. Add powdered sugar 1 cup at a time, mixing for 1 minute between each addition. Mix in cinnamon, vanilla and salt. Mix 1-2 more minutes or until light and fluffy. Refrigerate frosting 15-30 minutes before piping onto cupcakes. Refrigerate cupcakes until serving.
