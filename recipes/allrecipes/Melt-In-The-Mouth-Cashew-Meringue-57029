Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper. In a large dry glass or metal bowl whip egg whites until soft peaks form. Add vanilla, cream of tartar, and cornstarch, and continue whipping at medium speed while gradually adding the confectioners sugar 1/4 cup at a time. Whip until the whites have a nice peak, but not stiff. Fold in cashew pieces with a rubber spatula. Drop rounded teaspoonfuls 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for about 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until the edges are lightly browned. Cool on wire racks. Store in an airtight container at room temperature when completely cooled.
