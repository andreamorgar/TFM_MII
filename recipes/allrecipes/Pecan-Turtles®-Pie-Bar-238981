Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Beat white sugar, butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and pinch of salt together in a bowl until smooth; add flour and stir until dough forms. Press dough into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly brown, 15 to 17 minutes. Cool crust completely. Whisk brown sugar, corn syrup, eggs, remaining vanilla extract, and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a bowl; add pecans and stir to combine. Pour brown sugar mixture over cooled crust. Bake in the oven until golden brown and filling is set, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool to room temperature; cut into 36 bars. Place bars in refrigerator until cold, about 1 hour. Melt the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave). Set cold bars on waxed paper and drizzle melted chocolate over the top.
