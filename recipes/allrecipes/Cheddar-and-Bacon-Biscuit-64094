Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Grease a large baking sheet. Into a bowl sift together flour, baking powder, sugar, baking soda, and salt. Stir in sage and with fingertips blend in butter until mixture resembles meal. Stir in bacon and Savory Market Sharp Cheddar Cheese Flavor. Add buttermilk and stir until mixture just forms into a dough. Gather dough into a ball and on a lightly floured surface knead gently 8 times. Pat out dough into a 6- by 5-inch rectangle. Cut dough into 9 rectangles and arrange about 1 inch apart on baking sheet. Bake biscuits in middle of oven 15 minutes.
