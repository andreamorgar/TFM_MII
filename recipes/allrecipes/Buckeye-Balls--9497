Blend together the peanut butter, sugar and melted butter. Allow to chill in refrigerator. Roll into 1 inch round balls and return to refrigerator. In a double boiler over medium heat, melt the chocolate and shortening. Whisk together until smooth. With a toothpick inserted in the balls, dip them into the chocolate so they look like buckeyes. Place on waxed paper and allow to set in refrigerator.
