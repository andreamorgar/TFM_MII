Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Spray the waffle iron with cooking spray. Whisk cream cheese frosting, corn syrup, and water together in a bowl until smooth. Place 1 cinnamon roll dough slice on each section of the preheated waffle iron, close the iron, and cook until waffles are golden and cooked through, 2 to 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining dough. Drizzle waffles with syrup.
