Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch square baking dish. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, 3/4 cup of sugar, and baking powder. Add the milk, shortening, 1 egg, and lemon extract, and use an electric mixer to mix on low speed for 1 minute, then on medium speed for 1 minute. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and spread evenly. Sprinkle blueberries over the batter. In a medium bowl, stir together 2 beaten eggs, ricotta cheese, 1/3 cup of sugar, and vanilla extract. Spoon this mixture over the blueberries, and spread evenly. Bake for 55 to 60 minutes in the preheated oven, until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool completely before cutting into squares and serving.
