Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place apples in an 8x8 inch baking dish. Toss apples with syrup. In a separate bowl, mix together flour, oats, sugar, and salt. Cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle mixture evenly over apples. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes, until topping is golden brown. Serve warm or at room temperature.
