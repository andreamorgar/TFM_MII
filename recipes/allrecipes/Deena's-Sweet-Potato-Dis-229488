Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish with 1 tablespoon butter. Beat sweet potato, sugar, half-and-half, eggs, and vanilla together in a bowl with an electric hand mixer; spread into prepared casserole dish. Top sweet potato mixture with marshmallows. Stir 1/3 cup melted butter, brown sugar, pecans, and flour together in a bowl; sprinkle over marshmallows. Bake in preheated oven until hot throughout, about 30 minutes.
