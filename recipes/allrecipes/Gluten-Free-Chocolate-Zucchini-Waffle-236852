Preheat waffle iron according to manufacturer instructions. Stir brown rice flour, sorghum flour, dark cocoa powder, baking powder, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Whisk zucchini, soy milk, eggs, water, oil, and honey together in a separate bowl; add flour mixture and whisk together until evenly moistened. Prepare the surfaces of the waffle iron with cooking spray. Ladle 1 cup of the batter into the waffle iron, close lid, and cook until you have a crispy brown waffle, about 5 minutes. Repeat, applying more cooking spray between waffles, until all batter is used.
