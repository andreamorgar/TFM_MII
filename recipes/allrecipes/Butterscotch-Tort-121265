For topping, combine brown sugar, flour and salt in a saucepan. Stir in orange juice and water until smooth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until slightly thickened. Stir some of the hot mixture into beaten egg; return to pan, stirring constantly. Cook and stir until nearly boiling; reduce heat. Cook and stir 1-2 minutes longer (do not boil). Remove from the heat; stir in butter and vanilla. Cool completely. In a mixing bowl, beat cream until soft peaks form. Beat in confectioners' sugar until stiff. Place one cake layer on a serving plate; spread with a third of the whipped cream. Repeat layers twice. Drizzle some of the topping over cake. Serve remaining topping with cake. Refrigerate leftovers.
