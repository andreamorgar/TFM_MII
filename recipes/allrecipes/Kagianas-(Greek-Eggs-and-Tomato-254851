Place tomatoes into a food processor; blend until smooth. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in tomatoes, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until all liquid has evaporated from the tomatoes, 10 to 15 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add eggs; cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is evenly dry and no large chunks remain, 7 to 10 minutes.
