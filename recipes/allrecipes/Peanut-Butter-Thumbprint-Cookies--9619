Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, cream the shortening and sugar. Blend in peanut butter, salt, egg, vanilla and flour. Mix well. Shape dough into balls about 1 inch in diameter. Press your thumb into the center of each ball, creating a 1/2 inch depression. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes and cool on a rack. Fill the centers with a tart jelly/fruit preserve.
