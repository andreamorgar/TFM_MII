Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cook the ground beef and onion together in a large skillet over medium heat until the beef is completely browned; stir the barbeque sauce and Cheddar cheese into the ground beef. Pour the mixture into a 9x13-inch dish. Whisk the baking mix, eggs, and milk together in a bowl; pour over the beef mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and cooked throughout, about 25 minutes.
