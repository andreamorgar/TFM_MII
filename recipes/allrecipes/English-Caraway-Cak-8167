Preheat oven to 350 degrees F ( 175 degrees C). Grease and flour the bottom and sides of an 8 inch round cake pan with 1 tablespoon softened butter or margarine. Sift together flour, salt, and baking powder. Cream 1/2 cup butter or margarine and sugar together. Mix in caraway seeds and egg. Add flour mixture and milk, beating well. Pour batter into prepared cake pan. Bake for about 45 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool.
