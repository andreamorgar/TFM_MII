Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine the olive oil, garlic, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a large, resealable bag; seal and shake to combine. Add the chicken wings; reseal and shake to coat. Arrange the chicken wings on a baking sheet. Cook the wings in the preheated oven 1 hour, or until crisp and cooked through.
