Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray and lightly coat with flour. Whisk cake mix, pudding mix, 1/4 cup white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Beat vegetable oil, water, 1/2 cup white wine, and eggs into flour mixture using an electric mixer until batter is smooth. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool cake in pan on a wire rack, about 1 hour. Combine 1/2 cup white sugar, butter, 1/4 cup white wine together in a saucepan immediately after removing cake from oven. Cook sugar mixture, stirring constantly, over medium heat until sugar is dissolved and butter is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Spoon 1/2 the glaze over cake while cake is still warm. Invert cooled cake onto a cake plate and spoon remaining glaze over top of cake. Allow cake to absorb glaze, about 15 minutes. Dust cake with confectioners' sugar.
