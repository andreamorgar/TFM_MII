Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Cut peaches in half and remove peach stones. Cut each half in half again. Wrap prosciutto around each peach section; secure with small bamboo skewers. Grill peaches, turning often, until prosciutto gets a little crisp around the edges and the peaches begin to caramelize, about 6 minutes. To serve, spoon burrata onto serving plates. Remove peaches from skewers; place several of the grilled peaches around the cheese. Drizzle with olive oil. Top with a sprinkle of sea salt and pepper; garnish with basil.
