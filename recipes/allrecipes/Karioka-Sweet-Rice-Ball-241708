Mix rice flour, shredded coconut, and 3/4 cup coconut milk together in a bowl until dough is well mixed. Form dough into balls, about 1 tablespoon per ball. Heat oil in a pot over medium heat. Fry dough balls in the hot oil until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat and transfer balls to a paper towel-lined plate. Pour 1/2 cup coconut milk into a saucepan; bring to a boil. Stir brown sugar into hot coconut milk until liquid thickens, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove saucepan from heat, cool coconut coating slightly, and dip balls into coating. Cool slightly before serving.
