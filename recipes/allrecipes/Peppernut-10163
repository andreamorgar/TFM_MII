Heat molasses with butter, stirring until butter melts. Cool to room temperature. Beat egg and stir into molasses mixture. Thoroughly mix dry ingredients, except fruit sugar. Add dry mixture to molasses and butter gradually. Blend thoroughly. Shape into small balls. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 10-12 minutes. Roll in fruit sugar while warm. Store in a tightly covered tin to keep them semisoft.
