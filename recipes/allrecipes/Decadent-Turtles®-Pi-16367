To Make Crust: In a medium bowl mix cookie crumbs and white sugar. Stir in softened butter or margarine until mixture forms a ball. Press into a 9 inch pie pan. To Make Filling: In a medium bowl, combine softened cream cheese and sweetened condensed milk. Beat on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 8 minutes. Pour into pie crust. To Make Topping: In a small saucepan, combine caramels, brown sugar, and 2 tablespoons milk. Melt over medium heat, stirring frequently, until smooth. Drizzle mixture over top of filling. In a small saucepan, combine chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons milk. Melt over low heat until smooth, stirring frequently. Drizzle over filling. Sprinkle pecans on top. Chill at least 3 hours before serving.
