Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets. Beat sugar and margarine together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat eggs into the margarine mixture. Add matzo cake meal, orange juice, potato starch, and salt; mix until smooth dough forms. Stir in chocolate chips. Drop teaspoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are light brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
