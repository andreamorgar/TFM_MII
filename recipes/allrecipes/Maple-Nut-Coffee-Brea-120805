In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add milk, shortening, sugar, egg, salt, maple flavoring and cardamom; mix well. Add the flour; beat until smooth. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Grease a baking sheet or 14-in. pizza pan or line with foil. For filling, combine the brown sugar, pecans, cinnamon and maple flavoring; set aside. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide into thirds. Roll each into a 14-in. circle; place one on prepared pan. Spread with a third of the butter; sprinkle with a third of the filling. Top with a second circle of dough; top with butter and filling. Repeat. Pinch to seal. Carefully place a glass in center of circle. With scissors, cut from outside edge just to the glass, forming 16 wedges. Remove glass; twist each wedge five to six times. Pinch ends to seal and tuck under. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. For glaze, combine the sugar, maple flavoring and enough milk to achieve desired consistency; set aside. Carefully remove bread from pan by running a metal spatula under it to loosen. Transfer to a wire rack. Drizzle with glaze. Cool completely or serve while slightly warm.
