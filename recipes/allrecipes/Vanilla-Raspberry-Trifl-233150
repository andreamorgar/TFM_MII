Line the bottom of a deep glass dish with 1/2 the ladyfingers. Pour 1/2 the rum over ladyfingers; top with 1/2 the raspberries. Beat cold milk, pudding mix, and orange zest together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth, about 2 minutes. Spoon 1/2 the pudding over raspberry layer. Arrange the remaining lady fingers atop pudding layer and around sides of bowl. Pour remaining rum over ladyfingers; top with remaining raspberries and pudding. Refrigerate trifle for flavors to set, about 1 hour. Beat heavy cream in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium-low speed until fluffy. Spoon whipped cream over trifle and sprinkle with almonds.
