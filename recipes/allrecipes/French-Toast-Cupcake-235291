Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. Whisk flour, milk, yogurt, white sugar, butter, raisins, brown sugar, maple syrup, vanilla extract, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl until a batter forms. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 20 to 25 minutes.
