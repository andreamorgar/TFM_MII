Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, combine spinach, artichoke hearts, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, white pepper, and lemon juice. Mix well, and spoon mixture into a 1 quart baking dish. Top with remaining 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until hot and bubbly.
