Place the carrots, potatoes, mushrooms, onion and celery in the slow cooker. Place the stew meat over the vegetables. In a medium bowl, combine the soup mix with the can of soup. Add the water and mix together well. Pour this in the slow cooker over the meat and vegetables. Add water as needed so that the liquid comes just to the bottom of the meat. Cook on low setting overnight, adding more water as necessary in the morning. Allow to cook all day.
