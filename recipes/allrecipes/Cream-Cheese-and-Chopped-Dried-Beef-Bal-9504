In a large bowl, combine the Cheddar cheese, cream cheese, olives, Worcestershire sauce, onion salt, garlic salt and celery salt. Mix until smooth. Shape into ball, wrap in foil, and refrigerate until needed. About 30 minutes before serving, remove foil from cheese ball and reshape if necessary. Roll chopped beef to completely coat. Chill several hours or overnight.
