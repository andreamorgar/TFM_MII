Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. In a large bowl, combine the sugar, eggs, oil and vanilla and mix until well blended. Stir in the flour and cinnamon. The mixture will be thick. Fold in the chopped apple and nuts. Spread the batter in the prepared baking dish, and sprinkle with butterscotch chips. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool and cut into squares.
