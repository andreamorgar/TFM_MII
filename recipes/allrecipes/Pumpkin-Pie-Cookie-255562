Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets with cooking spray. Mix pumpkin, shortening, and vanilla extract together thoroughly in a bowl. Stir flour, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, and baking powder into the cookie dough. Drop tablespoonfuls of cookie dough 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 12 to 14 minutes.
