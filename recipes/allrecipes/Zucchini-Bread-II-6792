In a large bowl, combine eggs, oil, sugar, zucchini, and vanilla. Mix well. Add flours, baking powder, soda, salt, wheat germ, and cinnamon; stir to combine. Stir in raisins and nuts, if desired. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour, or until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean.
