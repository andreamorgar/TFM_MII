Combine chickpeas, 3/4 cup panko bread crumbs, red potato, red onion, garlic, egg, 1 tablespoon olive oil, cilantro, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, cumin, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. Form mixture into 2-inch patties. Place 1/4 cup panko crumbs in a shallow bowl. Gently press patties into the crumbs to coat. Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry patties in the hot oil until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Set patties aside. Stir yogurt, dill, lemon juice, garlic salt, and white pepper together in a bowl. Serve sauce drizzled over falafels.
