Heat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Grease bottoms only of 12 muffin cups or line with baking cups. In a medium bowl, combine flour, 1/2 cup white sugar, baking powder and salt; mix well. In a small bowl, combine milk, oil and egg; blend well. Add dry ingredients all at once; stir just until dry ingredients are moistened (batter will be lumpy.) Fill cups 2/3 full. In small bowl, blend 1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar, 1 tablespoon butter (softened), 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 cup chopped nuts or flaked coconut with fork until crumbly. Sprinkle over muffins before baking. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 1 minute before removing from pan. Serve warm.
