Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Butter a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish. In a large bowl, whisk together the egg, persimmon pulp, sweetened condensed milk, vanilla and melted butter. Combine the sugar, flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon; whisk into the persimmon batter until well blended. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until the pudding is set and the top is lightly browned.
