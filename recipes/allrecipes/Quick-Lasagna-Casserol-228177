Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Cook pasta according to package directions; drain. In a large skillet cook Johnsonville(R) Italian Ground Sausage, onion, sweet pepper, and garlic until sausage is no longer pink; drain fat. Transfer sausage mixture to a very large bowl. Stir in Classico(R) Tomato and Basil pasta sauce, fennel seed, and cooked pasta. Transfer the pasta mixture to a 3-quart rectangular baking pan. In a medium bowl stir together ricotta cheese, egg, and 1 cup of the Italian blend cheeses. Spoon the ricotta cheese over the pasta mixture in large dollops. Sprinkle the remaining shredded Italian blend cheeses over the top. Bake, uncovered, for 35 to 40 minutes or until heated through. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
