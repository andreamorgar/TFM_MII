Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes; cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and chop. In a mixing bowl, combine the potatoes, chicken, peas and corn. Add enough salad dressing to coat, mix well. Top with sliced tomatoes, cover and refrigerate for 2 hours. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
