Melt clarified butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Sprinkle one side of chicken pieces with garam masala and place seasoned side down in hot butter. Sprinkle top of chicken pieces with more garam masala and saute for 5 minutes. Turn chicken pieces, adding more butter as needed, and saute for 5 to 10 minutes more, or until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside.
