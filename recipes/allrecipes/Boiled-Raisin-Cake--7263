Boil raisins in 2 cups of water for 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Add vegetable oil and cold water to the raisins. Mix sugar, flour, spices, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Add the raisin mixture, and stir till just mixed. Pour into a greased and floured 9 x 13 inch baking pan, and bake for one hour in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven. It is done if a toothpick comes out clean.
