Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir ground beef until crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir in Cheddar cheese and onion soup mix. Divide crescent roll dough into triangles along perforated edges. Place 1 tablespoonful beef mixture onto each triangle; roll dough over meat and transfer crescent rolls to a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
