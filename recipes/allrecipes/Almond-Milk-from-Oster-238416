Place almonds and water in Oster(R) Versa(R) Performance Blender. Blend on HIGH for 1 minute. Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve lined with several layers of cheesecloth; let stand until completely drained. Pick up edges of cheesecloth; squeeze gently to remove milk. If desired, return strained milk to blender and add honey and salt; PULSE on HIGH 2-3 times to combine. Transfer to a covered container; refrigerate until cold. Use within 3 days.
