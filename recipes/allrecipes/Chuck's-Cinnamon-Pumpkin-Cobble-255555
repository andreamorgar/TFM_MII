Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch baking pan. Beat egg whites in a bowl until soft peaks form. Stir bread mix (not including cinnamon sugar packet), water, vegetable oil, and egg yolk together in a bowl until batter is just mixed; fold in egg whites. Beat pumpkin puree, cream cheese, white sugar, cinnamon, vanilla extract, baking soda, and baking powder together in a separate bowl. Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan; swirl in the pumpkin mixture. Pour remaining batter over pumpkin layer; top with cinnamon sugar packet from bread mix. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes.
