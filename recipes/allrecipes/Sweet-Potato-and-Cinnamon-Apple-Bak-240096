Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place diced apples and sweet potatoes in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic loaf pan. Sprinkle cinnamon and nutmeg over apple mixture; add enough water to leave 1/2-inch water in bottom of pan. Cook in microwave until the potatoes have softened are easily pierced with a fork, about 8 minutes; drain. Dot apple mixture with butter. Bake in preheated oven until potatoes and apples are completely softened, about 10 minutes.
