Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place flour, sugar, and pepper into a resealable plastic bag and shake to mix. Shake bacon with flour mixture a few strips at a time to coat. Place coated bacon onto a baking sheet or broiler pan. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes or until bacon has cooked to desired doneness.
