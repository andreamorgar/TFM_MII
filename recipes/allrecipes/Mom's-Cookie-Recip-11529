Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan. Pour cereal and peanuts into the pan and spread around evenly. In a heavy sauce pan, bring sugar and corn syrup to a rolling boil, over medium heat. Remove from heat and stir in the peanut butter. Pour the sugar mixture evenly over the cereal and peanuts. Let cool and cut into squares.
