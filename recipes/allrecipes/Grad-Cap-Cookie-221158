Cut licorice candy whips into 2-inch pieces, and pull them apart to make small strings. Set aside. Place a miniature peanut butter cup upside down on a work surface; top with a dab of frosting. Center a chocolate-covered graham cracker cookie onto the frosting to make a small cap with a mortarboard. Gently press the cookie onto the peanut butter cup. Place a small dab of frosting in the center of the graham cracker cookie and attach a red licorice string as a tassel, letting the tassel drape over the edge of the cookie. Place a candy-coated milk chocolate piece onto the center of the cookie over the end of the tassel to make a button. Repeat with remaining candies and cookies to make 50 graduation caps with tassels.
