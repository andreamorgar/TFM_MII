Wash and peal potatoes. If using large potatoes cut them in half. Place potatoes in a medium sauce pan covered with water. Cook over medium heat until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, cool, and mash. In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 1/2 cup mashed potatoes with butter or margarine, eggs, buttermilk and vanilla; beat until smooth. In another bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add flour mixture to the potato mixture; stirring until well combined. Refrigerate batter for 1 hour. Fill a 2 to 4 quart sauce pan 1 to 2 inches deep with vegetable oil and heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Form the chilled batter in 1 tablespoon size balls. Use a spoon to carefully slide the potato balls into the hot oil. Let cook until brown, turn, and cook opposite side. Remove from oil, briefly drain on paper towels, and roll in powdered sugar. Serve hot.
