In a large bowl, whisk together the salad dressing, peanut butter and sugar until smooth. Add the vinegar, whisking until dressing is creamy. Add additional vinegar to get creamy consistency, if necessary. Add the apples, grapes, peanuts, marshmallows, raisins and celery to the dressing mixture and toss until evenly coated. Serve immediately.
