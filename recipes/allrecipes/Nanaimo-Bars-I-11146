In a saucepan, melt 1/2 cup butter or margarine with 2 squares chocolate. Remove from the heat, and stir in white sugar, egg, rolled oats, coconut, chopped nuts, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Press mixture into a greased 9 inch square pan, and chill for 1 hour. Combine confectioners' sugar with 3 tablespoons softened butter, 1/2 teaspoon of the vanilla, and milk. Mix until it has an icing-like consistency, and spread it over the oat mixture in the pan. Chill for 1/2 hour. Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter or margarine with remaining 2 squares chocolate. Spread over the top of the bars. Chill for 4 to 5 hours. Cut into squares using a hot knife; dip knife in hot water, and let it melt through the chocolate.
