Mix milk, cream, and sugar together in a large bowl. Refrigerate to let sugar dissolve. Brew the coffee grounds with water in a coffee maker or French press. Refrigerate coffee until completely cooled, at least 30 minutes. Beat milk mixture using an electric mixture until slightly thickened to the consistency of buttermilk. Stir coffee into milk mixture. Transfer milk-coffee mixture to an ice cream maker and follow manufacturer's instructions for making ice cream.
