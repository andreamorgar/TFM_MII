Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or grease lightly. Mix sugar, oil, eggs, vanilla extract, salt, baking powder, purple yam powder, and flour, in this order, in a large bowl until dough is well blended. Drop tablespoons of dough onto the baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies look firm, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool for at least 5 minutes before gently transferring to a wire rack.
