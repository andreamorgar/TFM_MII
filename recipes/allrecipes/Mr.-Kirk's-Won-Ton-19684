In a large bowl, mix the pork, salt, soy sauce, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, green onions, bean sprouts, egg, bok choy and sherry. Place 1 teaspoon of the pork mixture in the center of each wonton wrapper. Fold the wrappers to the center forming a triangle. Gently press together the edges with moistened fingers. Fold in half again lengthwise, then fold back and bring together the corners. Press two corners together. In a heavy skillet or wok, heat oil over high heat. Deep fry each wonton 2 minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels.
