Combine tapioca and chia seeds in a pot and cover with water; let soak until thickened and gelatinous, at least 1 hour. Mix coconut milk, palm sugar, cocoa powder, arrowroot powder, and salt into tapioca mixture; cook and stir over medium heat until desired thickness is reached, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and stir vanilla into the pudding.
