Slice goat cheese into one inch pieces and place in a single layer on a large platter. Sprinkle olive oil, sun-dried tomatoes, black olives, basil and rosemary over the cheese. Using toothpicks, insert the garlic cloves into the cheese throughout the mixture. Allow the mixture to marinate 6 hours, or overnight, in the refrigerator. Remove the toothpicks, and serve with sliced French bread.
