Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line the bottom of four 9-inch round cake pans with parchment paper. Combine devil's food cake mix, water, eggs, and oil in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until batter is smooth, about 3 minutes. Spread cake batter evenly in the prepared cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 24 to 29 minutes. Cool in the pans, about 30 minutes. Invert cakes onto a flat work surface and peel off parchment paper. Spread some chocolate frosting over each cake. Spread whipped cream over the chocolate frosting. Press strawberries into the whipped cream; cover with more whipped cream. Stack cake layer carefully.
