Combine pudding mix with half and half. Cook on low heat 12 to 15 minutes, or until mixture comes to a boil and partially thickens. Stir well occasionally. Turn off heat and allow to cool slightly. Mix in rum. Chill pudding thoroughly. Whip 1 1/4 cups cream and 1 tablespoon sugar until stiff. Fold into chilled pudding mixture. Using a brush, coat a deep, 10" diameter bowl, with raspberry preserves up to within 1 inch of top. Slice both sponge cakes horizontally into halves. Skim crust off top of both layers. Place top slice, crust side up in bottom of preserves-coated bowl, curving outer edge of layer upward. Combine brandy and sherry, and sprinkle a fourth of the mixture (approximately 2 tablespoons) over the cake slice. Spread 1/3 of the chilled pudding mixture over the surface of the cake slice. Repeat procedure 2 additional times. Finish by arranging 15 to 18 strawberries on the top of the third layer of pudding and cover with fourth cake layer, crust side down. Sprinkle with remaining brandy-sherry mixture Whip the remaining 1 cup cream and 2 tablespoons sugar until stiff. Make mounds of whipped cream around the edge of the bowl and across the diameter with a spoon. Top each mound with a strawberry. Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.
