Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place the two halves of the squash with the cut sides facing down into a baking dish. Bake the squash in the preheated oven until tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Strip the squash from the rind with a fork into short strands and set aside. Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the onion and jalapeno pepper in the hot oil until the onion is browned and soft, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the squash and taco seasoning; cook and stir the mixture for 5 minutes more. Season with salt. Stuff into taco shells to serve.
