Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Arrange tart shells on a baking sheet. Distribute raisins evenly into shells. In a large bowl, combine brown sugar, corn syrup, shortening, egg, vanilla and salt. Mix until smooth, and pour over raisins in shells. Bake in preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until done. Be careful not to over bake.
