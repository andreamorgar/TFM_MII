Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake crust in oven for 10 minutes; set aside. In a saucepan, allow gelatin to soften in cold water. Add 1/3 cup sugar, salt, and beaten egg yolks; blend together. Heat over low heat stirring until gelatin dissolves and mixture coats spoon. Do not bring to a boil. Remove from heat, stir in cognac and creme de cacao. Chill until mixture thickens. In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff; while beating, slowly add rest of sugar. Fold egg white and sugar mixture into the thickened filling. Whip the heavy cream and gently fold half of it into the cognac mixture. Pour into graham cracker crust; cover and refrigerate for an hour. Garnish with remaining whipped cream and chocolate curls.
