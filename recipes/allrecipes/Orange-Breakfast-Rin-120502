In a small mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, sugar and orange peel until blended; set aside. Unroll both tubes of dough; press perforations and seams together to form two rectangles. Overlap rectangles at one end and press the seam to seal. Spread cream cheese mixture over dough to within 1/2 in. of edges. Sprinkle with the chopped almonds. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch seam to seal. Place seam side down on a greased baking sheet; pinch ends together to form a ring. With scissors, cut from outside edge two-thirds of the way toward center of ring at 1-in. intervals. Separate strips slightly; twist to allow filling to show. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 10 minutes before carefully removing from pan to a wire rack. Combine confectioners' sugar and orange juice; drizzle over warm coffee cake. Garnish with sliced almonds.
