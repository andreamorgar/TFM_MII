Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange habanero pepper, jalapeno pepper, and red chile peppers on a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until browned, about 15 minutes. Transfer peppers to a food processor; add tomatoes, onion, cilantro, green onions, and garlic. Pulse until desired consistency.
