Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with aluminum foil. Spread the potatoes and onion into the bottom of the lined baking dish. Stir the flour, salt, and pepper together in a shallow bowl. Roll the chicken breasts in the flour mixture, and arrange atop the potatoes and onion. Stir the vegetable oil, mushroom soup, and water together in a bowl; pour over the chicken. Sprinkle the Cajun seasoning over the entire dish. Cover the dish with aluminum foil. Bake the chicken breasts until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
