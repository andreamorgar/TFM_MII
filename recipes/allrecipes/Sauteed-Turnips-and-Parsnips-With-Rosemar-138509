Heat oil and butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook turnips, stirring occasionally, until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Add parsnips and shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and almost tender, about 10 minutes. Add garlic, rosemary, and salt and pepper to taste and cook, stirring, until vegetables are tender, about 3 minutes more.
