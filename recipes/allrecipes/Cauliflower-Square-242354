Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spray with cooking spray. Mix cauliflower, mozzarella cheese, red bell pepper, egg, garlic, garlic salt, black pepper, and nutmeg together in a large bowl until mixture holds together. Spread mixture in a thin layer onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 12 minutes. Sprinkle pepperjack cheese over top and continue baking until cheese is bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes more. Cool and cut into 3- to 4-inch squares.
