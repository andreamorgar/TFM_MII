Pour the hot water over the raisins and cinnamon. Let stand for 10 minutes, then drain, and set aside. Place the applesauce, peanut butter, vanilla extract, maple syrup, canola oil, and ground flax seed in the bowl of a food processor; process until smooth. With the motor running, slowly add the garbanzo beans, drained raisins, instant oatmeal, and coconut. Process until the mixture is smooth or to your desired consistency.
