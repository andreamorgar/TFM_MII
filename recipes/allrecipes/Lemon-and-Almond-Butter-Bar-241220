Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix lemon juice and lemon zest in a large mixing bowl. Pour honey into a microwave-safe bowl and heat in microwave until melted; stir with the lemon juice mixture. Add almond butter to the mixture and stir until smooth. Fold coconut into the mixture; add oats and stir to coat. Press the mixture into a baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until browned along the edges, about 30 minutes. Cool to room temperature before cutting into bars.
