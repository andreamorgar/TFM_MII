Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Whisk bread flour, oat flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Mix almond milk, applesauce, and coconut oil together in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture until batter is just combined. Fold chocolate chips into batter; let stand for 5 minutes. Scoop 1/4 to 1/2 cup batter into preheated waffle iron; cook according to manufacturer's instructions, about 4 minutes per waffle.
