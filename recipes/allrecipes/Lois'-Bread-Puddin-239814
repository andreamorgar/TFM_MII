Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish. Stir brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon together in a bowl; add bread cubes and toss to coat. Transfer bread cubes mixture to prepared baking dish. Whisk milk and eggs together in another bowl; pour over bread cubes mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and set, about 45 minutes.
