Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place onion in skillet and cook, stirring, until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook another minute. Stir in lentils, broth, chili powder, cumin, and oregano. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until lentils are tender, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Combine black beans and corn in a saucepan (if using canned beans and corn, drain first). Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until heated through about 8 minutes. Spread tortilla chips on a serving platter. Spoon a layer of lentils on the chips, then a layer of black beans and corn, and then salsa. Sprinkle with shredded cheese. Serve while still warm.
