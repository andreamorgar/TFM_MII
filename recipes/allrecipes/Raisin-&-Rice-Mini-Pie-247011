Cut each piecrust in half and roll each portion to fit 4 (5-inch) mini pie pans. Beat together eggs, sugar, milk, butter, and rice until well blended; stir in remaining ingredients. Divide filling between the 4 pie pans. Place pies on baking sheet; bake in preheated 375-degree F oven for 15 minutes. Lower to 300 F, bake for additional 15-20 minutes until center is set and crust is golden brown. (If crust begins to brown too much, cover crust edges with foil.) If preferred, the filling can be baked in a 10-inch piecrust; just add approximately 30 extra minutes to the cooking time.
