Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Mix dry ingredients except confectioner's sugar. Add nuts and dates. Then add eggs which have been lightly beaten. Mix well. Press mixture into ungreased cookie sheet as thin as possible. Bake for 15-20 minutes. Cut into 1 -2 inch squares while hot. Roll into balls as soon as the squares are cool enough to handle then roll in confectioner's sugar. Allow to cool completely before eating.
