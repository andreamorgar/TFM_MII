Heat oil in a heavy pot or deep fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Beat together egg, milk, and melted shortening; stir into flour mixture. Mix in the corn kernels. Drop fritter batter by spoonfuls into the hot oil, and fry until golden. Drain on paper towels.
