Mix shortening, white sugar, egg, molasses, and water thoroughly. Sift together flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, baking soda, and spices and blend in. Chill dough until firm. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Drop dough by teaspoonfuls about 2 inches apart on lightly greased baking sheet. Bake about 8 minutes, or until almost no imprint remains when touched lightly. While slightly warm, frost with icing. To Make Frosting: Blend confectioners' sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Add cream to make icing easy to spread. Spread on cookies with spatula or pastry brush.
