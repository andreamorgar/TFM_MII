Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large baking dish. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in melted butter until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Combine 2 eggs, 1 cup milk, oats, raisins, almonds, vinegar, curry powder, sugar, salt, turmeric, and black pepper in a large bowl. Add onions and ground beef; mix well. Spread the beef evenly into the prepared baking dish; top with bay leaves. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and drain excess fat from the beef. Beat 1 egg and 1/4 cup milk together in a bowl; pour over the beef mixture. Continue baking in oven until the top is beginning to brown, about 30 minute more. Remove and discard bay leaves to serve.
