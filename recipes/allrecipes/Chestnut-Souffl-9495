Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks until thick and lemon colored. In a separate bowl, beat together the chestnut puree, sugar, milk, and brandy. Add egg yolks and mix until smooth. In a large bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold the beaten whites into the chestnut mixture. Pour into an ungreased 1 1/2 quart souffle dish. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes. Top with whipped cream and serve.
