Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix boiling water and flax seed meal together in a bowl; set aside to thicken. Combine oats, chia seeds, hemp hearts, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl; stir in agave nectar, coconut oil, and flax mixture until well mixed. Fold chocolate chips into mixture; press into a 9x11-inch baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, about 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature and slice into bars. Refrigerate before removing from pan.
