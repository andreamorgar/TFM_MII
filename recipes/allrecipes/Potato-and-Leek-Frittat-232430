Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch baking dish. Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir leeks and potato in the melted butter until softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Spoon leek mixture into the prepared baking dish. Beat eggs, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan-Reggiano cheese, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Pour egg mixture over leek mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set, 20 to 25 minutes.
