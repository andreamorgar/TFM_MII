Stir water, sugar, and salt together until the sugar and salt dissolves in a container large enough to hold the corn. Submerge corn in the brine; soak at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove corn from the brine, shake to remove excess liquid, and cook directly on an oven rack for 1 hour.
