Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cream together butter, white sugar and brown sugar until fluffy. Beat in egg, vanilla and pumpkin. In a separate bowl, mix together the oats, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, raisins and flour. Stir into pumpkin mixture. Drop cookies by the heaping teaspoonful on to cookie sheets covered with parchment paper. Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until slightly browned around edges. Remove from oven and place on cooling racks. Frost with your favorite powdered sugar glaze or leave plain.
