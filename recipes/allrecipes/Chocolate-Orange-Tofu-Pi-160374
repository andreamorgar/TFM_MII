Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, using an electric mixer or stand mixer, whip the cream cheese and tofu until smooth. Add the cocoa powder, sugar, vanilla, coffee liqueur, orange oil, honey, and vinegar; beat until smooth. Fold in half of the chocolate chips, then pour the batter into the pie shell, sprinkle with the remaining chocolate chips. Bake in preheated oven until set, about 25 minutes. Cool to room temperature and then refrigerate until cold before serving, at least 4 hours.
