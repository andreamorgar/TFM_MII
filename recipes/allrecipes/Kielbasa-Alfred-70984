Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg noodles, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add sliced kielbasa, and fry until toasty at the edges. Drain excess grease, and stir in the alfredo sauce. Stir in the noodles, and season with salt and pepper. Serve with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese.
