RInse oysters and soak in fresh water. Heat deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine cornmeal, garlic powder, Cajun seasoning, black pepper and seasoned salt in a large plastic bag. Place oysters in bag and shake until well coated. Cook oysters 3 or 4 at a time in hot oil. Oysters will float and be golden brown when done. Drain briefly and serve warm.
