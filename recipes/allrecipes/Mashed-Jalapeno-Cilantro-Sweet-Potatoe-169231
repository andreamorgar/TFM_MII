Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake the sweet potatoes in the preheated oven until tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Once tender, peel, and place into a mixing bowl. While the potatoes are baking, place the jalapeno pepper in the oven, and bake until the skin loosens, about 20 minutes. Peel, mince, and place into the bowl with the potatoes. Add the softened butter, orange juice, and cilantro; mix with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then transfer to a 1 quart baking dish. Drizzle with the melted butter and sprinkle with the walnut pieces. Bake in the preheated oven until hot in the center, about 20 minutes.
