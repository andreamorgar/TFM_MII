Heat oil in a deep-fryer or kettle to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Gently add the wings, one at a time, to the hot oil. Stir gently to assure the wings do not stick together. Fry the chicken wings in the preheated oil until cooked through and the are floating gently atop the oil, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the wing should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Stir the melted butter, hot pepper sauce, garlic powder, and black pepper together in a large mixing bowl until thoroughly combined. Add the cooked wings to the sauce and turn to coat; transfer to a serving platter.
