Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Arrange apples slices on a metal baking sheet. Mix sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl; sprinkle over apple slices. Bake in the preheated until apples are dried and edges curl up, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Transfer apple chips, using a metal spatula, to a wire rack until cooled and crispy.
