Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain. Transfer ground beef to a slow cooker. Stir in kidney beans, diced tomatoes, onion, half the green bell peppers, half the red bell peppers, chili powder, garlic, salt, and ground black pepper until well combined. Place remaining green bell peppers and red bell peppers on top of mixture. Cover the cooker and cook on High setting until vegetables are soft and the flavors have blended, about 2 hours. Stir chili and cook on Low setting for 6 more hours. Serve in bowls; garnish each serving with 1 tablespoon of shredded Cheddar cheese.
