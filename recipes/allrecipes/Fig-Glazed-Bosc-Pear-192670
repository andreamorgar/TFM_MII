Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a baking sheet. Arrange the pear quarters on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle all but 1 tablespoon of the honey over the pears; set the reserved honey aside. Stir the fig preserves, pomegranate molasses, and cinnamon together in a small saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and keep at a simmer until ready to use. Bake the pears in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Reduce oven heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Brush the fig glaze over the baked pears. Continue baking until firm on the outside, but tender inside, 25 to 35 minutes more. Allow to cool 5 minutes. While the pears cool, whip the cream, almond extract, and reserved honey together with a hand mixer in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until thick. Dollop the whipped cream mixture over the pears to serve.
