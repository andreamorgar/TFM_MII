Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x10-inch glass baking dish with butter-flavored shortening; dust with flour. Place apples in a colander. Douse with lemon juice; drain. Cut with an apple slicer and place into a bowl. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon allspice and 1 tablespoon cinnamon. Arrange seasoned apples in the prepared baking dish; cover evenly with sliced butter. Mix oats, flour, baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon allspice, mulling spice, and salt together in a bowl. Beat sugar, coconut oil, applesauce, milk, eggs, and vanilla extract in a stand mixer on medium speed. Beat in oat mixture on low speed, scraping down the sides, until dough is combined. Spoon dough over apple mixture; sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
