Beat cream cheese, egg yolk, and 1/4 cup sugar together in a bowl until smooth. Pour melted butter into a separate shallow bowl. Mix remaining 3/4 cup sugar and cinnamon together in a third shallow bowl. Spread even amounts of the cream cheese mixture onto one side of each bread slice. Roll the bread into a cylinder around the cream cheese filling. Brush melted butter around the outside of each cylinder and roll the cylinders in the cinnamon-sugar mixture to coat. Arrange the rolls in a dish, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze for at least 2 hours. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Transfer frozen rolls to a baking dish and bake in preheated oven until hot in the center, 10 to 12 minutes.
