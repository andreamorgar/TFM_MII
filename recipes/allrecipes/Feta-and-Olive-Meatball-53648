Preheat your oven's broiler. In a large bowl, mix together ground lamb with parsley, onion, feta cheese, green olives, eggs, and Italian seasoning. Shape into 16 meatballs, and place 2 inches apart on a baking sheet. Broil about 3 inches away from the heat until browned on top. Turn over, and broil on the other side.
