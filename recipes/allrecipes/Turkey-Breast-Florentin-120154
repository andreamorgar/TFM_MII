Cut a lengthwise slit in turkey breast to within 1/2 in. of opposite side; open meat so it lies flat. Cover with plastic wrap and flatten to 1/2-in. thickness. Remove plastic wrap; set aside. In a skillet, cook two bacon strips until crisp. Drain, reserving 2 tablespoons drippings. Crumble bacon; set aside. In the drippings, saute onion until tender. Stir in flour, tarragon, salt and pepper until blended. Gradually stir in milk. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from heat. Refrigerate 1/2 cup sauce. Add the spinach, mushrooms and crumbled bacon to the remaining sauce; spread over turkey breast. Starting at a short end, roll up and tuck in ends; tie with kitchen string. Place on a rack in a greased roasting pan. Brush with butter. Cover loosely with foil. Bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour. Remove foil. Cut remaining bacon strips in half; place over the turkey. Bake 25-35 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 170 degrees F. Discard string. Let turkey stand for 10 minutes before slicing. Meanwhile, heat the reserved sauce; stir in cheese until melted. Serve with the turkey.
