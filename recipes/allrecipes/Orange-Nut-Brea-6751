Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 3 to 4 mini loaf pans (5x3 inches each). Zest and juice an orange; set 1 tablespoon zest aside. Pour orange juice into a one-cup measuring cup, add boiling water to fill to one cup measurement. Pour juice mixture into a bowl and add the melted shortening, vanilla, egg, flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, grated orange zest and chopped nuts. Stir well and pour batter into the prepared pans. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean and bread is nicely browned.
