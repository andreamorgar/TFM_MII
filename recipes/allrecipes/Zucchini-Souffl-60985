Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift flour and baking powder together into a bowl. Lightly beat eggs, and mix them into the flour with the oil. Stir in the onion and zucchini, and season with salt and pepper. Pour mixture into a well-greased 9x13 inch baking dish, and sprinkle with paprika and parsley. Bake in preheated oven for one hour.
