Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add salt pork cubes, and fry until browned on the outside. In a large bowl, mix together the salt pork, potatoes, onions, eggs, butter, milk, salt and pepper. Pat the mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, then reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), and continue baking for an additional 40 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving.
