Rehydrate and prepare 6 servings of Idahoan Hash Browns according to package, ensuring that they are golden brown. Prepare scrambled eggs and add diced poblano chilies. Warm tortillas and top with 1/2 cup hash browns and 1/2 cup scrambled egg mixture. Sprinkle with scallions and 3 dollops of soft goat cheese on top of eggs. Fold the sides of the tortilla in towards the center and roll up from the bottom, making sure to tuck in the sides as you roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Serve with a side of salsa verde.
