Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a small mixing bowl, combine onion flakes, mustard, poppy seeds and margarine. Split each dinner roll. Make a sandwich of the ham and cheese and the dinner rolls. Arrange the sandwiches on a baking sheet. Drizzle the poppy seed mixture over the sandwiches. Bake for 20 minutes, or until cheese has melted. Serve these sandwiches warm.
