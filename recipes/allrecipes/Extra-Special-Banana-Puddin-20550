Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). In a medium bowl, use fingers to mix together coconut, flour and sugar with butter until a crumbly mixture is formed. Spread on a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until light brown, stirring occasionally, 45 minutes. Prepare pudding mix with cold milk according to package directions. In a 9x13 inch dish, sprinkle two-thirds of the coconut mixture. Spread the prepared pudding over the crust. Top with sliced bananas and whipped topping. Sprinkle remaining crust on top and refrigerate until serving.
