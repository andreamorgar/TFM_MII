Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes; cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, and transfer to a large bowl. Cool slightly. Peel and slice into a large bowl. In a small bowl, combine oil, vinegar, consomme, green onion, parsley, and salt and pepper. Gently toss warm potatoes with dressing. Cover, and refrigerate several hours or overnight.
