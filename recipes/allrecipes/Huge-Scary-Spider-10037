Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheet. In a saucepan melt chocolate over low heat. Let cool. In a small bowl mix flour, baking powder and salt. In a medium bowl beat margarine on low speed until smooth. Add sugar and beat until creamy. Stir in egg, vanilla and chocolate. Add flour mixture and mix well, forming a stiff dough. To make spider, shape a 2 inch flat oval for the body. Make the spider's head by flattening a circle about 1/2 inch wide. Shape dough for legs each about 2 inches long and less than 1/4 inch wide. Attach the head and legs to body. Put two red candies into head for eyes. Bake for 5-8 minutes. Let spiders cool on baking sheet to avoid breaking when moving.
