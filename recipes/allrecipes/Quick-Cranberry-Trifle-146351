Stir together cranberry sauce and Sherry in a bowl. Set aside. Combine heavy cream and ice cream in a bowl, then set in a larger bowl of ice and cold water and beat with an electric mixer until stiff. Divide half of cake cubes among 4 dessert glasses. Top each serving with a scant 1/4 cup cranberry mixture, then top each with 1/4 cup whipped-cream mixture. Repeat layering with remaining cake cubes, cranberry mixture, and whipped-cream mixture. Chill, loosely covered with plastic wrap, at least 8 hours for flavors to develop.
