Place 1 1/2 cups of the peanuts in an ungreased 7x11 inch baking pan; set aside. In a saucepan, melt butter and peanut butter chips over low heat. Add sweetened condensed milk and marshmallows. Cook and stir until melted. Pour over peanuts and sprinkle remaining peanuts on top. Cover and refrigerate; cut into bars when set.
