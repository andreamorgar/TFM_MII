Combine flour, butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt in a bowl to form a dough; stir in pecans. Shape dough into a large ball and refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Roll dough into 1-inch balls and place on a baking sheet. Make an indentation with thumb in the middle of each ball, forming a 'nest'. Fill each nest with about 1 teaspoon chocolate chips. Bake nests in the preheated oven until edges are crisp (cookies will not brown), 10 to 12 minutes. Cool cookies on a wire rack, about 15 minutes.
