Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 9x9 inch baking dish. Stir the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Combine the eggs, condensed milk, milk, oil, and vanilla in a second mixing bowl. Add egg mixture to the cornmeal mixture all at once and beat until well blended, about 2 minutes. Spread berries over the bottom of prepared dish. Spoon batter evenly over the berries to completely cover. Bake in preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 45 minutes.
