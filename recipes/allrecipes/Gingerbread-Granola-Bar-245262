Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x13-inch baking sheets. Mix oats, flour, brown sugar, white sugar, salt, cinnamon, cloves, and ginger in a large bowl. Stir in oil, honey, molasses, and eggs. Mix until well-combined. Pat mixture onto baking sheets using your hands. Bake in the preheated oven until edges begin to brown and center no longer looks glossy, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool for about 10 minutes; cut into bars while still warm.
