Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line 8x8-inch baking dish with parchment paper. Whisk egg white, coconut sugar, and almond extract together in a bowl. Fold almond flour into egg mixture until just combined; spread batter into baking dish. Sprinkle almonds over top of batter and press down lightly. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Transfer cookies to a cooling rack using the parchment to lift it out of baking dish. Cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.
