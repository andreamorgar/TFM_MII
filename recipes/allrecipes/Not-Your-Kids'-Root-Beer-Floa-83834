In a pint glass, stir together 1/4 cup of the root beer and the root beer schnapps. Place in the freezer for 2 hours, or until ready to drink. Leave the remaining root beer at room temperature. When ready to drink, scoop the ice cream into the pint glass, and top off with the room temperature root beer.
