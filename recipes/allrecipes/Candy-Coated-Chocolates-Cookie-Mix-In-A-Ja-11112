Attach a card with the following directions: Cookies 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line one baking sheet with parchment paper. 2. Empty the contents of the jar into a large bowl and mix until all the ingredients are well combined. 3. Using your hands work in 3/4 cup softened butter or margarine until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. 4. Beat 1 egg with 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Work this into the flour mixture until well combined. Dough will be a little crumbly. 5. Shape dough into 1 inch sized balls and place 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. Slightly flatten the balls with the palm of your hand. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 to 14 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned. Remove cookies to a rack to cool.
