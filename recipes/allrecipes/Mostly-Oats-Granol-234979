Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Mix oats, coconut, wheat germ, peanuts, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, cinnamon, and ginger together in a bowl. Whisk honey, oil, and water together in a separate bowl. Drizzle honey mixture over oat mixture; toss to coat. Spread mixture in a thin layer on baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Stir and bake another 5 minutes. Stir again and bake until granola is slightly browned, 3 to 5 more minutes. Cool granola and stir in raisins. Store in airtight containers.
