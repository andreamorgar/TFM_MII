Place tomato slices in a bowl of ice water; soak for about 5 minutes. Heat about 1/2 inch of canola oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Combine cornmeal and flour in a bowl. Remove tomato slices from ice water, one at at time, and coat lightly in the cornmeal mixture; shake off any excess. Place in the hot oil. Cook tomato slices, working in batches, until edges are golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle lightly with salt.
