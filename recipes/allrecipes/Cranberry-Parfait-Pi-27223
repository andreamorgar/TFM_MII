Heat the cranberry juice in a medium saucepan over low heat. Stir in strawberry flavored gelatin until dissolved. Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Transfer to a medium bowl, and beat with an electric mixer until fluffy. In a blender or food processor, finely chop the whole cranberry sauce. Mix in the gelatin mixture and vanilla ice cream until well blended. Transfer blended mixture to the prepared graham cracker crust. Chill in the refrigerator 2 to 3 hours. In a medium bowl, whip together the heavy cream, white sugar and vanilla extract. Pour over the chilled pie before serving.
