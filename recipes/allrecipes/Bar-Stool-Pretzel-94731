Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion soup mix and hot pepper sauce. Coat pretzels in the mixture by dipping or brushing and place on a baking sheet. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, stirring every 15 minutes. Cool, then serve or store in an airtight container.
