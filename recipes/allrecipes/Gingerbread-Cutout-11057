Add about half of the flour, the sugar, molasses, egg, vinegar, baking powder, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, and cloves. Beat until thoroughly combined. Beat in remaining flour. Cover and chill for at least 3 hours or until dough is easy to handle. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. Divide the chilled dough in portions to be rolled out. On a lightly floured surface roll the pieces of dough to 1/8 inch thickness.
