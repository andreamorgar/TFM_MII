Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Generously grease a 9x12-inch baking dish with butter. Spread bread into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle apple pieces evenly over the bread pieces. Beat eggnog and eggs together in a bowl; pour over the bread and apples. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, remove aluminum foil, and continue baking until browned and somewhat set in the middle, about 10 minutes more.
