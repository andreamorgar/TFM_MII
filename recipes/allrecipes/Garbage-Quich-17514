Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. Evenly distribute bacon across bottom of each pastry shell, followed by half of cheese. Add broccoli, scallions, and tomatoes, then cover with remaining cheese. In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, half-and-half, nutmeg, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Pour half of mixture into each pastry shell. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake an additional 45 minutes, until quiches are set in center.
