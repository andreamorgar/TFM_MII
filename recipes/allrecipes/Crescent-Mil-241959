Put 8 fluid ounces water, cashews, agave nectar, and vanilla extract in a blender; blend for 2 minutes. Strain mixture through cheesecloth or a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Blend the strained bits of cashew mixture in the blender with remaining 8 fluid ounces water until smooth. Strain mixture through cheesecloth or sieve again. Pour strained liquid into a bottle and add cinnamon; refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes. Shake well before drinking.
