Whisk flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a small bowl. Whisk peanut butter, sour cream, butter, and boiling water in a large bowl until thick. Stir flour mixture into peanut butter mixture until batter is well mixed; fold in chocolate chips. Generously coat liner of a 6-quart oval slow cooker with cooking spray. Spread batter evenly in slow cooker. Whisk milk, white sugar, cocoa powder, and vanilla extract in a small bowl until smooth. Pour over batter.
