Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a small mixing bowl, combine cheese and butter or margarine. Stir flour and cayenne pepper into the cheese and butter mixture. Blend well. Wrap a tablespoon of dough around each green olive. Arrange the wrapped olives on a cookie sheet. Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden brown.
