Mix flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl; add butter and crush into the flour mixture with hands until it resembles breadcrumbs. Mix hot water and garlic into the flour mixture until it all comes together into a dough; turn out onto a cutting board dusted with flour. Knead dough 3 or 4 times. Cut dough into 10 pieces, roll into balls, and flatten into discs. Cover dough with a clean kitchen towel and let sit for 20 minutes. Heat a cast-iron skillet over-medium high heat. Roll out one of the dough discs to about the size of your skillet. Cook in hot skillet until golden and puffy, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove to a platter and cover with a clean kitchen towel to keep warm. Repeat with remaining dough portions.
