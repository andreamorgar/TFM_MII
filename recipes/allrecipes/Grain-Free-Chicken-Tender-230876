Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Mix almond flour, Parmesan cheese, basil, thyme, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Dip chicken strips in the melted butter; press strips into almond flour mixture until completely coated. Transfer coated strips to the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven on the middle rack until strips are golden brown and no longer pink in the center, at least 20 minutes.
