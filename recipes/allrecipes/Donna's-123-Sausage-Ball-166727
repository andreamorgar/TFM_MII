Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir the sausage, Cheddar cheese, and baking mix together in a mixing bowl until evenly combined; roll into 1 inch balls and place onto an ungreased baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the pork is no longer pink in the center and the balls are golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
