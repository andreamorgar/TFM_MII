Preheat broiler and oil rack of a broiler pan. Stir together garlic, five-spice powder, salt, and soy sauce in a large bowl. Cut off and discard tips from chicken wings with kitchen shears or a large heavy knife, then halve wings at joint. Pat dry and add to spice mixture, tossing to coat. Arrange wings in 1 layer on broiler pan and broil 6 to 7 inches from heat, turning over once, until browned and cooked through, 16 to 20 minutes total.
