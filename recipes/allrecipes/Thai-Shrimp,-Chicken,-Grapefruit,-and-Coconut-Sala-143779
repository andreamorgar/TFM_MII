Make the dressing by whisking together the lime juice, fish sauce, sugar, and garlic in a bowl. Toss together the sectioned grapefruit, shrimp, chicken breast, coconut, shallots, chile pepper, mint, and cilantro in a large bowl. Drizzle approximately 3/4 of the dressing into the grapefruit mixture and toss to combine. Combine the remaining dressing with the shredded lettuce in a separate bowl shortly before serving. Arrange the lettuce on a large platter. Layer the grapefruit mixture on top of the lettuce.
