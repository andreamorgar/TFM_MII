Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Combine the water and white sugar in a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Cook until the sugar is dissolved, remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Beat the eggs in a large bowl; add the evaporated milk and continue beating. Pour in the cooled sugar water and mix until well combined. Place the tart shells on a baking sheet. Strain the filling through a sieve, and fill the tart shells. Bake in the preheated oven until the filling has puffed a little bit, about 20 minutes.
