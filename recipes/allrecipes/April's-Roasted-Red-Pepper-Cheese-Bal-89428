In a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, garlic powder, cayenne pepper and Worcestershire sauce. I use a hand mixer. Stir in the roasted red peppers last. Spoon the mixture onto plastic wrap, and cover with another piece of plastic wrap. Shape into a ball, and roll in parsley to coat. Refrigerate until serving.
