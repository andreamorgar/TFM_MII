Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot; fry tortillas, one at a time, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer fried tortillas using tongs to a baking sheet. Spread salsa onto each fried tortilla; top with Cheddar cheese and Parmesan cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 8 minutes.
