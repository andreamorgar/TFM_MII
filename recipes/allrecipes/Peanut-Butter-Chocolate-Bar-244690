Grease a baking sheet and line with parchment paper. Mix white chocolate chips and peanut butter together in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until half-melted, 30 seconds to 1 minutes. Stir. Place semi-sweet chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until half-melted, 15 to 30 seconds. Stir vanilla extract into half-melted semi-sweet chocolate. Spread peanut butter mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Evenly distribute melted semi-sweet chocolate over peanut butter mixture. Using the tip of a sharp knife, drag semi-sweet chocolate through peanut butter mixture making a marble-pattern. Refrigerate until set, 30 minutes to 2 hours. Cut into pieces and store in an air-tight container.
