Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking dish. Stir rhubarb, white sugar, and 2/3 flour together in a bowl; pour into prepared baking dish. Mix 1 cup flour, butter, and brown sugar together in a bowl until mixture is crumbly; sprinkle over rhubarb mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and bubbling, about 1 hour.
