Puree the mangoes, honey, and lime juice in a blender or food processor until smooth. Whip the heavy cream to soft peaks, and fold into the mango puree. Beat egg whites in a clean dry bowl until stiff, then stir half into the mango mixture. When well blended, gently fold the remaining egg white into the mousse until no streaks remain.
