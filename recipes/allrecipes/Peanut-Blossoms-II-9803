Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease cookie sheets. In a large bowl, cream together shortening and peanut butter; gradually add sugar and brown sugar, creaming well. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Sift together dry ingredients and add to creamy mixture. Shape dough into balls, using a rounded teaspoon for each ball. Roll balls in sugar and place on a greased cookie sheet. Bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes. Remove from oven. Top each cookie with a candy kiss, pressing down firmly so cookie cracks around edges. Put back into oven for 2 to 5 minutes longer, until golden brown.
