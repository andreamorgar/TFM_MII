Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and rinse pasta under cold water. Pasta should be drained thoroughly of water. In a large skillet, heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and fry about 1 cup of pasta at a time until golden. Drain on paper towels. In large bowl, combine Parmesan, chili powder, garlic powder and dry mustard. Toss with drained pasta. Serve.
