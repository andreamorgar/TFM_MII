Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease 12 muffin cups. Place bacon in a skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, wheat germ and salt. In a separate bowl, combine eggs, milk, corn, butter, oil and bacon. Stir egg mixture into dry ingredients, just until combined. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25, until golden brown.
