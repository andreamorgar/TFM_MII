Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion, and cook 5 minutes, until tender. Stir in garlic, green bell pepper, and tomatoes. Season with salt, pepper, and cumin. Reduce heat, and simmer 15 to 20 minutes. Mix beans into the onion mixture. Stirring occasionally, cook 10 minutes. Toss in parsley, and transfer to a medium baking dish. Break eggs over the top, dot with butter, and season with salt and pepper. Bake 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until the eggs are cooked through.
