Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking sheet. Place eggplants on the baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until soft and seared. In a food processor, grind together garlic, basil and green chile peppers. Scoop eggplant from skins and mix with garlic mixture in the food processor. Transfer the mixture to a medium serving dish. With a fork, mash in tahini, lemon juice and salt. Garnish with mint and olive oil.
