Beat almond flour, eggs, Greek yogurt, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl with a mixer at high speed until creamy. Heat a skillet over medium heat; add just enough olive oil to cover the surface. Ladle 1/4 cup of the batter into the center of the hot skillet; cook until browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining batter.
