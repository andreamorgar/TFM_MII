Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a large cast iron skillet with 1 teaspoon coconut oil. Mix brownie mixes, 2/3 cup coconut oil, water, and eggs together in a large bowl. Combine cream cheese and chocolate-hazelnut spread in another bowl. Fold into the brownie mixture. Spread evenly in the cast iron skillet. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, about 1 hour. Let cool in the skillet, about 20 minutes. Run a knife around the skillet to release edges. Cover skillet with a large platter and flip brownies onto the platter. Let cool completely before cutting into squares, about 40 minutes.
