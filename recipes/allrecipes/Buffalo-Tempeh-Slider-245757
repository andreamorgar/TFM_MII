Place tempeh in a large bowl and cover with Buffalo sauce. Set aside to marinate, 10 to 20 minutes. Remove tempeh from Buffalo sauce, reserving sauce. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tempeh in a single layer, in batches, until heated through and lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Pour some Buffalo sauce back over tempeh to coat. Combine blue cheese, cilantro, green bell pepper, celery, and onion in a large bowl. Mix in enough Greek yogurt until topping just holds together. Divide tempeh pieces among pita pockets; top with a spoonful of the topping. Top with remaining Buffalo sauce.
