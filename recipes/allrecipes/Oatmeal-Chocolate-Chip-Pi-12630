Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix flour, sugar, pecans and oatmeal. Set aside. In a separate bowl, mix eggs, melted butter and vanilla. Add to the dry mixture and mix well. Fold in chocolate chips. Spoon into a pre baked 10 inch pie shell. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 25 minutes. It will still appear quite moist, but it will set up after it is removed from the oven.
