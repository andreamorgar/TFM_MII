Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Mix cream cheese and Cheddar cheese together in a bowl until evenly blended. Fill each jalapeno half with the cheese mixture. Put halves back together and wrap each stuffed pepper with a slice of bacon. Arrange bacon-wrapped peppers on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crispy, about 15 minutes.
