Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x12 inch baking dish. Scoop the refried beans into the baking dish, and smooth to form an even layer. Spread the salsa on top of the beans, and top with shredded cheese. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, until the mixture is hot and the cheese is bubbling.
