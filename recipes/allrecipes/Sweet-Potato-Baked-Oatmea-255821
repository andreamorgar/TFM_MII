Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8-inch baking pan. Mix rolled oats, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a mixing bowl until ingredients are evenly distributed. Mix mashed sweet potatoes, milk, eggs, and vegetable oil together in a separate bowl until well blended. Pour sweet potato mixture into oats mixture and mix well. Spread mixture evenly into prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until oatmeal has set and the top is golden brown, about 30 minutes.
