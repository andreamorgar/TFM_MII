Bring chicken broth, milk, and 1 teaspoon garlic to a boil in a saucepan. Stir in grits, reduce heat to low, and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and thoroughly mix in Cheddar cheese; season with salt and black pepper. Set grits aside and keep warm. Heat butter and olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and 2 teaspoons garlic until softened and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir shrimp into onion mixture and cook until shrimp are pink and no longer translucent in the center, about 5 more minutes. Stir in hot pepper sauce. Serve grits in a large serving bowl topped with shrimp mixture.
