Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 12 cup muffin pan. In a large bowl, mix the whole wheat flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, and baking soda. In a separate bowl, mix the bananas, egg whites, and vanilla extract. Mix the banana mixture into the flour mixture until smooth. Fold in the blueberries. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin pan. Bake 16 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.
