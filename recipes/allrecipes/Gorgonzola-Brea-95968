Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange the baguette slices in a single layer on a baking sheet. Brush the top of each one with olive oil or melted butter. Place a slice of pear onto each piece of bread, then crumble some of the cheese over the top. Sprinkle with walnuts. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the pears are browned and the cheese has started to melt.
