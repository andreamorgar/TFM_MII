Combine the crushed pretzels and parmesan cheese in a small bowl. Set aside. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water, and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the macaroni, and return to a boil. Cook until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well. Place the bacon in a large, deep pot, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Place the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Pour off the bacon fat, reserving 2 tablespoons of the fat. Melt the butter in the saucepan with the reserved bacon fat over medium heat. Stir in the onion, celery, carrots, and garlic; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the flour, and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, about 3 minutes. Gradually whisk the mustard, the beer, and finally the milk into the flour mixture; bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook and stir until the mixture is thick and smooth, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the cheese, bacon, red pepper, salt, and pepper. Turn off the heat, and stir in the cooked macaroni. Sprinkle with the pretzel and cheese mixture before serving.
