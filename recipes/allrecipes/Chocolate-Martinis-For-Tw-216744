Drizzle the chocolate syrup into two martini glasses, start 2/3 of the way up the side of the glass, and let the chocolate run to the bottom; set aside. Place the ice into a cocktail shaker. Pour in the vodka, chocolate liqueur, and creme de cacao. Cover, and shake until the outside of the shaker has frosted. Strain into the prepared martini glasses. Garnish with maraschino cherries to serve.
