Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium baking dish, mash the cream cheese with a fork. Blend in the mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice and green onion. Rinse the crab meat and remove any pieces of shell. Flake the crab meat and mix it into the cream cheese mixture. Bake 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven. Serve warm.
