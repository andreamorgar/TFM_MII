Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef until evenly brown; drain. In a 9x13 inch baking dish combine the beef, corn, salsa, olives, cooked noodles, beans, taco sauce, seasoning mix and tomato sauce. Bake in the preheated oven for 1/2 hour, or until cooked through.
