Cream together butter or margarine and sugar. Add eggs one at a time, beating after each addition. In another bowl, sift flour, salt, and baking powder together. Blend in to the creamed mixture, and then add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla to the dough. Spread dough in 9 x 13 inch greased baking pan, and sprinkle chopped nuts over top. In a small mixing bowl, beat egg white until stiff but not dry. Add brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla to the whipped egg white, and beat thoroughly. Spread meringue over the dough and nuts already in the pan. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 20 to 30 minutes. Cool, and cut into bars.
