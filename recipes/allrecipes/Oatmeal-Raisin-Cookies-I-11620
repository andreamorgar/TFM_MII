Combine eggs, vanilla and raisins in a small bowl; cover and let stand for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, cream the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together. Sift together the flour, cinnamon, and baking soda; stir into the creamed mixture. Then stir in the raisin mixture, rolled oats, and nuts. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto an unprepared cookie sheet. Bake for 10 minutes, or until lightly browned.
