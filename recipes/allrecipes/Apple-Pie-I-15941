Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place sliced apples in a large pot. Sprinkle with sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Mix well and cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until apples are tender but not mushy. Pour apple mixture into pastry-lined pie pan. Cover with second pastry shell. Seal edges and cut steam vents in top. Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, until crust is golden brown.
