Place oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Whisk together miso paste, seasoned rice vinegar, maple syrup, and hot chili sauce in a bowl. Brush an oven-ready skillet with vegetable oil. Place salmon fillets skin sides down in the cold skillet. Place over medium heat and cook until the skin starts to sizzle, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove pan from heat. Brush each salmon fillet with miso glaze. Place skillet under the preheated broiler and cook until the salmon is just cooked through and the top is browned, about 8 minutes. Remove each fillet from the pan, separating flesh from the skin; leave the skin in the pan.
