Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar. Stir in the eggs, one at a time, and then the vanilla. Mix in the flour and baking soda until combined. Then stir in the raisins just enough to distribute evenly. Drop by heaping teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool on wire racks.
