Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix cake mix, eggs, and vegetable oil together in a large bowl to form a dough. Combine confectioners' sugar and sprinkles together in a small bowl. Shape dough into 1-inch balls and roll each in the confectioners' sugar mixture. Arrange cookie balls on baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until tops are golden, about 6 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets, about 5 minutes, before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
