Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners. Mix cake mix, pudding mix, zucchini, eggs, sour cream, and applesauce together in a bowl until batter is smooth and thick; fold in chocolate chips. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 22 to 25 minutes.
