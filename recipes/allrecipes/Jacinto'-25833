Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, cream cheese, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each. Combine the flour and baking soda; stir into the sugar mixture. Mix in the chopped chocolate, coconut and walnuts. Drop by rounded tablespoons onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 11 to 13 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks.
