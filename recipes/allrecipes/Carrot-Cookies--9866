Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease cookie sheets. Mix shortening, sugar, eggs, and carrots. Blend in flour, baking powder and salt. Stir in coconut. Drop dough by teaspoonfuls about 2 inches apart onto lightly greased baking sheet. Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until no imprint remains when touched lightly. Immediately remove baking sheet. Let cool.
