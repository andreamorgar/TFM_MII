Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk egg yolks and water together in a small bowl. Combine egg yolk mixture, flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, butter, white sugar, vanilla extract, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on low speed until dough comes together. Press dough evenly into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan. Scatter chocolate chips over dough. Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl, using clean beaters, until foamy. Gradually add remaining 1 cup brown sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Spread beaten egg whites over chocolate chips. Bake in the preheated oven until top is lightly golden and edges start to pull away from the sides of the pan, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool completely before cutting into squares, about 30 minutes.
