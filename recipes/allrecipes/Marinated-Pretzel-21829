Break the pretzels into a large bowl. In a medium bowl, blend the olive oil, ranch-style dressing mix, garlic powder and dill weed. Pour the mixture over the pretzels. Marinate 1 hour, tossing approximately every 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread the marinated pretzels on a large cookie sheet. Bake approximately 10 minutes. Allow the pretzels to cool, then serve.
