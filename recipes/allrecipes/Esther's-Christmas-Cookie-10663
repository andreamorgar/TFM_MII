In a VERY LARGE BOWL, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time then stir in the vanilla and milk. Add candied cherries and pineapple, raisins and nuts mixed with flour. Stir in oatmeal and coconut. Make balls the size of a large walnut and slightly flatten. Place on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) one pan at a time on middle rack of oven, for 10 to 12 minutes, or until bottoms are light brown. Cookies will look underdone. Sprinkle with nutmeg and leave on cookie sheet for 10 minutes to finish cooking. Transfer to cooling rack. Have lots of containers ready!!
