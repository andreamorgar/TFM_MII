Preheat oven to 275 degrees F. (135 degrees C). Remove any visible excess fat from ham. Place the ham in a large turkey roasting oven bag and place in a baking dish. Pour cola over ham, remove as much air as possible and seal bag. Prick a few holes in bag to let steam escape and bake for 4 to 5 hours. Pour off excess juice and slice.
