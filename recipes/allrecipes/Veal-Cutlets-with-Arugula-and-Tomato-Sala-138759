Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spread bread crumbs in a shallow baking pan and toast 8 to 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 200 degrees F. Whisk together oil, juice, pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl until combined, then stir in tomatoes and onion. Gently pound cutlets to 1/8-inch thickness between 2 sheets of plastic wrap with flat side of a meat pounder or with a rolling pin. Sprinkle veal all over with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and season with pepper. Stir together bread crumbs and cheese in a large shallow bowl. Lightly beat eggs in another large shallow bowl. Dip veal, 1 piece at a time, in egg, letting excess drip off, then dredge in bread crumbs, coating completely, and arrange in 1 layer on a sheet of wax paper. Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then fry 2 cutlets, turning over once, until golden brown and just cooked through, about 6 minutes total. Transfer to paper towels to drain briefly, then transfer to baking pan and keep warm in oven. Add remaining 3 tablespoons oil to skillet and fry remaining cutlets. Add arugula and basil to tomato mixture and toss, then season with salt and pepper. Serve veal topped with salad.
