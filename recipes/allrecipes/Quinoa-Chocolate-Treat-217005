Grease a baking tray. Heat the chocolate chips, cinnamon, brown sugar, butter, and peppermint extract together in a large saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until the mixture forms a smooth liquid. Fold the quinoa and marshmallows into the chocolate mixture until evenly distributed; immediately spread into the prepared tray. Allow to cool completely before cutting into triangles to serve.
