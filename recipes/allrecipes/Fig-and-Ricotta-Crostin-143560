Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place the baguette slices on an ungreased, foil-lined baking sheet. Bake the bread in the preheated oven until the bottoms are brown, about 5 minutes; flip and bake until crisp, 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven. Spread 1 tablespoon of ricotta on each slice of toasted bread. Place a few ribbons of basil on each, arrange a slice of fig on top, and drizzle the finished crostini with balsamic vinegar.
