Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon butter and sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in egg, milk, and vanilla extract. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Add to the creamed butter mixture gradually, beating until dough is just combined. Shape dough into small balls; place on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 17 minutes. Reshape into balls while still warm. Let cool, 20 to 30 minutes. Place chocolate in a small microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave until softened, about 30 seconds; stir. Continue heating until melted, about 30 seconds more. Cool slightly, 3 to 5 minutes. Dip cookie balls in the melted chocolate. Set on a plate lined with waxed paper until chocolate hardens, about 10 minutes.
