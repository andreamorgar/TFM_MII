Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet. In a medium bowl, mix cream cheese, soy sauce, fresh ginger root, garlic, parsley and crabmeat. Cut wonton wrappers diagonally into triangles. Arrange triangles on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Sprinkle with paprika, increasing the amount as desired. Bake wrappers in the preheated oven until crisp and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Pour approximately 1/2 the duck sauce over cream cheese mixture. Serve the rest with the toasted won ton wrapper triangles for dipping.
