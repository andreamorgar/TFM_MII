Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spread chopped walnuts onto a baking sheet. Roast walnuts in the preheated oven until they are fragrant and browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove and let cool. Lightly toss chicken with grape halves, cranberries, apple, walnuts, and onion in a salad bowl. Whisk mayonnaise, vanilla yogurt, and lemon juice in a separate bowl. Pour dressing over salad and toss again to coat.
