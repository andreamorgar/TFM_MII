In a large bowl, combine chicken, celery, chives or green onions, yogurt, sour cream or mayonnaise, and tarragon; mix lightly. Cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour. Place nuts in a dry skillet. Toast over medium heat, turning frequently, until nuts are fragrant and lightly browned. Add almonds to chicken salad, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
