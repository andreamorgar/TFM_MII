Refrigerate 2 tall glasses until chilled, at least 30 minutes. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Spread marshmallow cream over graham crackers and place on a nonstick baking sheet. Broil graham crackers until marshmallow cream turns golden, about 3 minutes. Let cool. Pour chocolate milkshakes into chilled glasses. Place glasses on large plates. Top each milkshake with 2 scoops ice cream. Decorate milkshakes with broiled marshmallow crackers, muffins, cookies, toaster pastries, and peanut butter cups. Drizzle chocolate syrup on top and garnish with chocolate sprinkles.
