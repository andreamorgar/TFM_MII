Mix quinoa flour, 1 cup rice flour, xanthan gum, basil, rosemary, oregano, and salt together in a large bowl; make a well in the center. Whisk eggs and egg yolk together in a small bowl. Mix in water and olive oil. Pour into the well in the flour mixture; mix thoroughly until a dough forms. Lightly dust a work surface with 2 1/2 tablespoons rice flour. Knead dough until smooth and elastic, 8 to 12 minutes. Cover dough and let rest, about 10 minutes. Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Dust work surface with remaining 2 1/2 tablespoons rice flour. Roll each piece of dough into a square shape that is about 1/16-inch thick. Let dough rest, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Roll each square of dough up loosely; slice into 1/4-inch pieces. Unroll noodles. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook noodles until tender yet firm to the bite, about 2 minutes.
