Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish. Combine ground beef, rolled oats, French onion soup, and eggs in a bowl until thoroughly combined; transfer to prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the meat loaf is no longer pink in the middle and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), 60 to 75 minutes.
