Combine butter and sugar and egg yolk. Add dry ingredients and milk alternately. Divide dough into 2 equal parts. Melt chocolate over low heat and add to one half of the dough. Use a rolling pin and roll each half into a rectangle. Put the chocolate rectangle on top of the vanilla one. Roll up like a jelly roll in wax paper. Chill several hours, best if chilled overnight. Slice them and bake at 400 degrees (200 degrees C) for about 5 minutes.
