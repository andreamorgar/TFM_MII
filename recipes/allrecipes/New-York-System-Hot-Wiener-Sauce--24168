Place ground beef in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown; drain. Mix the chili powder, dry mustard, allspice, nutmeg, onion salt, garlic salt, celery salt, ginger root, cumin, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce and ketchup into the skillet. Simmer at least 1 hour, until a desirable consistency has been attained. Serve hot.
