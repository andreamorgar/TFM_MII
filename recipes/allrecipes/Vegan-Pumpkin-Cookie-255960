Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Combine flour, pumpkin, sugar, almond milk, vegetable oil, baking soda, cinnamon, vanilla extract, salt, and cinnamon sugar in a bowl until dough is smooth. Spoon dough, about 1 tablespoon per cookie, onto baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are beginning to crisp along the edges, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool cookies on baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
