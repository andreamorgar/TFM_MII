Combine flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, instant coffee, and salt in a microwave-safe mug or small bowl. Mix in vegetable oil, water, and vanilla extract until mixture is smooth and glossy. Add more water, 1/4 teaspoon at a time, if mixture looks a little dry. Microwave on high until top looks dry, about 1 minute.
