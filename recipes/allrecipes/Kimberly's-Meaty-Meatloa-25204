Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a mixing bowl, combine ground beef, breadcrumbs, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, onion, and parmesan cheese. Shape into a loaf and place in a 8x4-inch loaf pan. Top with tomato sauce. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until internal temperature measures 160 degrees F (70 degrees C); the meat should be well done, with no trace of pink. Remove from oven, and allow to rest for 10 minutes before serving.
