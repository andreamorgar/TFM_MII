Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium saucepan over medium high heat, saute the carrot and onion for 2 minutes, or until onion is transparent. Add garlic and saute for 2 more minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. In a large bowl, combine the parsley, beef, ketchup, 1/2 cup tomato sauce, bread and eggs, mixing well. Add the carrot/onion mixture and continue mixing, but do not over mix, as this will make the meatloaf dry. Transfer mixture to a 9x13 baking dish and form into a loaf. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 to 45 minutes. While loaf is baking, heat the remaining tomato sauce and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium low heat. Pour over loaf when done.
