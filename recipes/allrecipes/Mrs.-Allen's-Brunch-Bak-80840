Place bacon in a skillet over medium high heat, and cook until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside. Spread 1 side of each bread slice with about 1 teaspoon butter. Arrange 1/2 the slices buttered side down in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Layer with the crumbled bacon, 1/2 the Cheddar cheese, and 1/2 the Monterey Jack cheese. Arrange remaining bread slices over the cheese, buttered sides up. In a small bowl, mix the eggs and milk, and pour evenly over bread slices. Top with remaining cheese. Cover, and refrigerate 8 hours, or overnight. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bake the chilled Brunch Bake 1 hour, or until cheese is bubbly and eggs are set.
