In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Ladle out about 1/2 cup of the boiling water, and reserve. Add tofu. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add spinach or bok choy; simmer about 1 to 2 minutes, or until the greens are tender. Remove soup from heat. Blend white miso and barley miso into reserved hot water. Stir into soup. Ladle into bowls, and garnish with scallion. Serve immediately.
