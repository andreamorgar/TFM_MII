Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. In a large bowl, mix together flour, baking powder and salt. Use a fork to blend in the oil. Add buttermilk and stir until the dough comes together. Roll dough out on a lightly floured surface. Cut dough into biscuits. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until golden brown.
