In a medium bowl, mix ground beef, onion and seasoned bread crumbs. Form the mixture into bite-sized balls. In a large skillet over medium high heat, cook the balls until evenly brown throughout. In a large bowl, mix water, soy sauce, garlic and whiskey. Place the balls into the mixture. Cover and chill in the refrigerator at least 1 hour. Transfer the balls and sauce mixture to a slow cooker set to low heat. Cook at least 30 minutes before serving.
