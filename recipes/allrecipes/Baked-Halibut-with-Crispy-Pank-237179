Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir panko bread crumbs and melted butter together in a bowl until evenly coated. Pour enough chicken stock into an oven-proof skillet to cover bottom; arrange halibut fillets in skillet. Drizzle lemon juice over fillets; season with salt and pepper. Spread a think layer of Dijon mustard over each fillet; press bread crumb mixture over mustard layer. Place skillet in the preheated oven and cook until fillets flake easily with a fork and topping is browned, about 20 minutes.
