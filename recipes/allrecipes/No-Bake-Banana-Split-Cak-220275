Combine 1/2 cup melted butter with graham cracker crumbs in a bowl; press mixture into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Beat 2 cups confectioners sugar and 1 cup softened butter with eggs in a bowl with an electric mixer until very light and fluffy, about 15 minutes. Spread butter mixture over the graham cracker crust. Arrange sliced bananas on top of the butter mixture, then scatter fruit cocktail over bananas. Beat heavy cream until foamy in a large bowl. Gradually add 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar, continuing to beat until soft peaks form. Spread whipped cream over the fruit cocktail. Arrange the maraschino cherries decoratively on top.
