Preheat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. In a large bowl, sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a small bowl, beat together egg, orange juice, buttermilk, and canola oil. Whisk into the flour mixture. Stir in pineapple. Pour batter about 1/4 cup at a time onto the prepared griddle. Cook 1 to 2 minutes, until bubbly. Flip, and continue cooking until lightly browned.
