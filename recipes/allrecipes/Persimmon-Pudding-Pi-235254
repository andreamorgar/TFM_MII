Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spread melted butter evenly over the bottom of a baking dish. Beat persimmon pulp and sugar together in a bowl; beat in eggs. Beat in buttermilk and baking soda. Sift flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Gradually add flour mixture to persimmon mixture, stirring until well incorporated; stir in vanilla extract. Pour persimmon batter into prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden and cooked through, about 1 hour.
