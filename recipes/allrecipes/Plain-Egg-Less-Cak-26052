Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Sift the flour, baking powder and baking soda together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in the sweetened condensed milk, orange juice, vanilla and melted butter. Mix well and pour into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
