Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix cake mix, water, oil, and eggs together in a bowl until batter is smooth; beat with an electric mixer for 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 34 to 38 minutes. Poke holes into the cake using the handle of a clean wooden spoon. Drizzle sweetened condensed milk over the top of the warm cake, ensuring the holes get filled. Refrigerate cake until cool, about 1 hour. Spread raspberry preserves over cooled cake; refrigerate until cool, about 10 minutes. Spread whipped topping over raspberry preserves layer and sprinkle coconut over the top.
