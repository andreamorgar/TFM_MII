Heat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 x 13 inch pan. In a large bowl, combine cake mix, cherry pie filling, almond extract, and 2 eggs by hand; stir until well blended. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until it tests done. Cool. In a small saucepan, combine sugar, butter or margarine, and milk. Boil, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in chocolate chips until smooth. Immediately pour over partially cooled cake.
