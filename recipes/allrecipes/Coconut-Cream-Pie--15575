Preheat oven to broiler setting. To Make Coconut Custard: In a large saucepan combine 2 cups sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Add cocoa powder if desired. Mix well. Pour in 3 cups of the milk. Stir well and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently until mixture comes to a boil. Meanwhile, mix remaining 1 cup of milk with beaten egg yolks in a medium bowl. When mixture on stove thickens, add 1/2 cup of it to egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly, until thoroughly combined. Pour egg yolk mixture back into sugar mixture, whisking constantly. Bring mixture back to a boil. Boil for 1 minute, stirring frequently. Remove mixture from heat. Stir in butter, vanilla, and coconut. Set aside. To Make Meringue: Place reserved egg whites in a large metal or glass mixing bowl. Beat until foamy. Add 1/2 cup sugar, a little at a time, beating constantly until stiff peaks form. Pour custard into baked pie shell. Spread meringue over custard, covering completely. Place pie under preheated broiler. Bake 5 minutes, or until meringue is golden. Chill before serving.
