Tear the ham, salami and American cheese into small pieces. Place in a large bowl. In a medium bowl, blend the mayonnaise and oregano. Mix the mayonnaise mixture into the ham mixture 1/2 cup at a time, until meats and cheese are well coated. Mix in the onion. Before serving, mix in the lettuce and tomatoes. Serve with the hoagie roll pieces for dipping.
