Place the baking chocolate, butter, and corn syrup in a saucepan, and cook and stir over low heat for about 5 minutes, until the chocolate and butter have melted and the mixture is smooth. Remove from the heat, and let cool. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour the beaten eggs into the cooled chocolate mixture, stir in the walnuts, and mix well. Pour the chocolate filling into the prepared graham cracker crust. Bake in the preheated oven until the pie filling is cooked and set, about 30 minutes,. Let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour, before serving.
