Whisk together eggs, milk and Pyure Organic Liquid Stevia Extract. Set aside. Mix together mascarpone, pumpkin puree, Pyure Bakeable Stevia Blend, pumpkin pie spice and salt until smooth. Divide mascarpone filling among 4 slices of bread. Sandwich with remaining bread slices. Dip sandwiches into egg mixture, turning to coat well. On greased griddle or in greased skillet, cook sandwiches over medium heat for about 3 minutes per side or until crisp and golden brown.
