Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 muffin tins with paper liners. Combine cream cheese, pumpkin puree, sugar, egg whites, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves in a large bowl; mix until well blended and no lumps remain. Place 1 vanilla wafer in the bottom of each lined cup. Scoop in batter using an ice cream scoop, filling each cup approximately 3/4 full. Bake in the preheated oven until set, 23 to 26 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool, about 1 hour.
