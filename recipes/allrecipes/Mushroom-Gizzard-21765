Clean and rinse gizzards, being sure to trim off any green material. Place cleaned gizzards in a large bowl. Mix flour, paprika, salt and pepper together in a small bowl; pour mixture onto gizzards and toss well to coat. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Brown coated gizzards in oil; drain and place in a microwave safe dish. In a medium bowl mix together the soup and a soup can of water; pour mixture over gizzards, cover and cook in microwave on high for 15 minutes. Stir, replace cover and cook for another 10 minutes. Check for tenderness; if still too firm, cook in microwave for another 5 minutes. Let sit and set for 5 minutes after cooking, before serving.
