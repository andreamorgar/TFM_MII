Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan. Melt the butter over low heat. In a large mixing bowl, combine the butter, honey and eggs. Beat well. Stir in the flour, salt and baking powder and mix well. Mix in zucchini, dates and walnuts until well blended. Spread mixture into baking pan and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until lightly brown. Cut into 1 x 3 inch long pieces, and roll in confectioners' sugar while still warm.
