Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Mix flour, oats, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk milk, eggs, and butter in another bowl; stir into flour mixture until batter is just combined. Pour batter into preheated waffle iron. Cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per waffle.
