Rinse gizzards and place in a large pot. Add water to cover, cover pot with lid and boil over medium high heat until gizzards are tender, about 30 to 45 minutes. Once gizzards are tender, drain 1/2 of the water out of the pot. In a small bowl, combine the ramen flavor packet mixes with the flour and add enough water to liquefy mixture. Pour into pot with gizzards and season with salt and pepper to taste. Reduce heat to low and simmer until sauce/gravy is thickened to taste. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ramen noodles and cook for 5 to 6 minutes or until al dente; drain and serve hot with gizzards stew on top.
