In a bowl, combine the buttermilk and cereal; let stand for 10 minutes. Add egg. Combine the dry ingredients; stir into cereal mixture just until moistened. Spoon into two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
