Stir the onion, ginger, garlic, star anise, white wine, salt, pepper, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, rice vinegar, and chicken together in a mixing bowl. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator 4 to 6 hours. Meanwhile, place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and allow to cool before cutting in half. Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade, and squeeze the excess marinade from the chicken; reserve the marinade. Cook and stir the chicken in the hot oil until browned on all sides and no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Remove and discard the star anise from the marinade, and stir the marinade into the chicken. Bring to a boil, then add the cherry tomatoes and halved potatoes. Cook until the potatoes are hot and the cherry tomatoes begin to burst, about 3 minutes. Dissolve the cornstarch in the water, and stir into the chicken mixture along with Thai basil. Cook and stir until thick, about 1 minute more.
