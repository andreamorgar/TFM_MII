Cook apples and water in a medium saucepan over medium heat, covered, stirring occasionally and breaking up apples with the back of a spoon, 10 to 12 minutes or until apples form a coarse puree. Add SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and flour; cook 2 to 3 additional minutes, stirring constantly until SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener dissolves and mixture is thickened. Stir in cinnamon. Spoon apple mixture into a bowl to cool slightly. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray; set aside. Unroll piecrusts; cut each one into four wedges. Roll each wedge into a 6-inch circle. Place 3 level tablespoons apple mixture on each circle; moisten edges of dough with water and fold dough over to form a half-moon shape. Crimp to seal, and cut vents to release steam. Place on prepared pan; brush tops with egg white. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until turnovers are browned. Cool turnovers on a wire rack 10 minutes before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature.
