Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine sugar, salt, corn syrup, peanut butter and eggs with electric mixer. Stir in peanuts by hand. Pour filling into pie crust. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until crust is golden brown. (Center of filling may be slightly soft but will become firm as pie cools.)
