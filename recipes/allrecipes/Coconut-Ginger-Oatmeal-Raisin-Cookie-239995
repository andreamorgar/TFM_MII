Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine flour, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl. Mix ginger and lemon juice together in a separate bowl. Beat butter and sugar together in a bowl until smooth and creamy; add egg and beat until light and creamy. Stir oats, coconut, raisins, and ginger mixture into creamed butter mixture until well mixed. Add flour mixture to butter-oats mixture and stir until dough is well mixed. Spoon dough onto the prepared baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly golden brown, about 10 minutes. Cool cookies in a wire rack.
