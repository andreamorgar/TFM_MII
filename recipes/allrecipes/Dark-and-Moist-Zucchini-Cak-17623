Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 8x4 inch loaf pans. In a medium bowl, beat together the eggs with the oil. Stir in the applesauce, brown sugar, vanilla, molasses, and honey. Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and cinnamon; combine with applesauce mixture until just moistened. Finally, stir in the zucchini and nuts. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake for 1 hour in preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Cool in the pan for 15 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
