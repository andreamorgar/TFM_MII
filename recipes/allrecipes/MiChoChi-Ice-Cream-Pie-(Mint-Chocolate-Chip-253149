Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place about 30 chocolate wafer cookies in a blender; pulse several times until they are roughly the size of small peas. Add melted butter; pulse until mixture resembles coffee grounds. Pour crumbs into pie pan. Press with the back of a spoon over the bottom and up the edges of the pan. Bake in preheated oven 10 minutes. Cool. Remove ice cream from freezer to thaw at room temperature, about 1 hour. Pour very soft ice cream into a bowl. Mix in chocolate chips; stir until well combined. Pour ice cream mixture into cooled pie crust. Freeze until set, at least 1 hour. Serve pie wedges with a drizzle of chocolate syrup.
