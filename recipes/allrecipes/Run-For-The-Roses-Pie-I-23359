Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large, heavy saucepan, combine brown sugar, corn syrup, molasses, butter, bourbon, vanilla and salt. Heat to boiling, stirring frequently. Boil 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove pan from heat and let mixture cool. In a small bowl, beat eggs with half-and-half until blended. Mix eggs into cooled syrup mixture until well incorporated. Stir in walnuts and chocolate chips. Pour the filling into pie crust. Bake in preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Serve warm or at room temperature.
