Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange phyllo tart shells on a baking sheet. Fill each shell with about 1 teaspoon Swiss cheese and 1/2 teaspoon bacon. Lightly beat egg, half-and-half, basil, parsley, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Pour about 1 teaspoon egg mixture into each phyllo shell. Bake in the preheated oven until egg is set in the middle and lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes.
