Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Grease the inside of the waffle iron. Mix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk milk, bananas, canola oil, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture until batter is moistened with a few lumps. Spoon about 1/4 cup batter into preheated waffle iron and cook according to manufacturer's instructions.
