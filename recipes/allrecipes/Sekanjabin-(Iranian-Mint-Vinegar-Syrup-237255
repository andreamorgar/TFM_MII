Stir honey and water together in a pot; bring to a boil and stir constantly until honey dissolves. Add vinegar, reduce heat to low, and simmer until syrup flavors combine, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Submerge mint in hot syrup and cool to room temperature. Remove and discard mint. Chill in the refrigerator.
