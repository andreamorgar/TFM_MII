Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pulse pecans in a food processor until finely ground. Place cookie dough onto a work surface and knead pecans into dough. Roll dough back into a log, similar to the original shape. Slice dough into 1/4-inch-thick slices and arrange on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are golden around the edges, about 10 minutes. Cool cookies on a wire rack. Melt chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Spread apricot preserves on the top of half of the cooled cookies. Place a second cookie over the apricot layer creating a sandwich. Dip half of each sandwich cookie into the melted chocolate and place on a sheet of waxed paper to dry.
