Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions and spray the inside with cooking spray. Mix oats, rice flour, cornmeal, and baking powder together in a bowl. Stir soy milk, eggs, and oil together in a separate bowl; add to oats mixture and stir until batter is just combined. Pour 1 cup batter into the preheated waffle iron and cook according to manufacturer's instructions until lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
