Heat 1 tablespoon avocado oil in a wok or skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir eggs in the hot oil until mostly cooked through, about 1 minute. Transfer eggs to a plate. Pour remaining 1 tablespoon avocado oil into wok; cook and stir tomatoes until liquid has mostly evaporated, about 2 minutes. Return eggs to wok and add green onions; cook and stir until eggs are fully cooked, about 30 more seconds.
