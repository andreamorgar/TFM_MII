In a large bowl, stir together butter and sugar until creamy and smooth. Stir in the egg yolks and vanilla. In a separate bowl, mix together flour and salt; then slowly blend with creamy mixture. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll out dough into 1 inch balls. Dip balls into slightly beaten egg whites, then roll in chopped walnuts. Place balls 1 inch apart onto baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven for 5 minutes. Remove from oven, and press thumb gently into the center of each cookie. Return to oven, and bake 5 minutes more. Remove cookies to wire racks to cool. Fill top of each cookie with frosting, and top with a chocolate-coated peanut.
