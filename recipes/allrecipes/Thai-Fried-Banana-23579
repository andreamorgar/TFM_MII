In a medium bowl, mix rice flour, tapioca, sugar, salt and coconut. Stir in water, a little at a time, and mix to form a thick batter. Peel the bananas and cut each lengthwise into 3 or 4 pieces. Heat oil in deep-fryer or deep wok to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Completely coat each banana slice in batter, then fry in hot oil until golden. Drain on paper towels. Serve at once.
