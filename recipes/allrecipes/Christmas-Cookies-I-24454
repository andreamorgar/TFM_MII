In a medium bowl, combine the golden raisins, dates, red and green candied cherries, pecans and grape juice. Set aside to soak. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, vanilla, and egg yolks until light and fluffy. Combine the flour, baking soda and baking powder; stir into the creamed mixture. Mix in the dried fruit mixture. Beat egg whites to stiff peaks; fold into the dough. Scoop cookies with a small ice cream scoop onto prepared cookie sheets. Pat down slightly. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks.
