Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg noodles, cook for 6 to 8 minutes, until al dente, and drain. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Mix in the shark, shrimp, and tomatoes with green chiles. Cover, and cook 15 minutes, or until shark is easily flaked with a fork. Serve the shark mixture over the cooked egg noodles. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese, and season with pepper.
