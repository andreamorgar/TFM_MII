Place fava beans in large bowl and cover with several inches of water. Let soak, 8 hours to overnight. Drain. Combine soaked fava beans, red onion, parsley, cilantro, dill, garlic, coriander, salt, and cumin in a food processor; process to a dough-like consistency. Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add sesame seeds; cook, stirring occasionally, until toasted, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large plate. Shape fava bean mixture into balls. Roll in sesame seeds to coat. Fill a large saucepan 1/4 full with oil; heat over medium heat. Fry fava bean balls in batches until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
