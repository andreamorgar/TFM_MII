Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook for 15 minutes or until tender but firm. Drain the potatoes and transfer to a large bowl. In a large mixing bowl, toss together the vanilla yogurt, green onions, lemon, celery, carrots, bean sprouts, red onion, salt, pepper and garlic salt. Pour the mixture over the potatoes. Mix gently, thoroughly coating but not mashing the potatoes. Refrigerate until serving.
