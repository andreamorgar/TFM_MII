Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray. Melt margarine in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir cream and brown sugar into melted margarine until sugar dissolves, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Spread 1 can of biscuit dough into the bottom of the prepared tube pan; sprinkle with cinnamon. Layer 1 more can biscuit dough into the tube pan and sprinkle with cinnamon. Layer last can biscuit dough into tube pan. Pour margarine mixture over biscuit dough. Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are slightly browned, about 20 minutes. Let biscuits cool 5 to 10 minutes in pan. Turn pan upside-down onto a serving plate and remove pan.
