Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour one 9 x 13 inch cake pan. Whip the sugar, eggs, baking powder, and the vanilla sugar. (To make Vanilla Sugar: Place one clean vanilla bean in a pint jar with 1 - 1 1/2 cups white sugar. Shake occasionally. After a few days, use the sugar and replenish as necessary.) Add the shortening and mix well. Stir in the flour, the cocoa powder, and the orange juice and mix until homogeneous. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake cake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 40 minutes. Remove cake from oven and immediately spread coffee glaze over top. To Make Glaze: Five minutes before cake is done, mix together confectioners' sugar, Nescafe powder, and milk. Use immediately to spread over hot cake.
