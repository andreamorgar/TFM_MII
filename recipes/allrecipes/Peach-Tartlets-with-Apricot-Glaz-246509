Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Cut each sheet of puff pastry into nine 3-inch squares. Dab a small amount of apricot preserves into the center of each square. Fan 3 slices of peach over the preserves, leaving a slim border of pastry exposed. Spoon a small amount of apricot preserves over the peach slices. Bake in the preheated oven, 1 baking sheet at a time, until puff pastry turns golden, about 10 minutes. Thin remaining apricot preserves with 2 teaspoons hot water in a small bowl to make a glaze. Spoon some of the glaze over each baked tartlet. Return to the oven and bake until tartlets are golden brown, about 2 minute more. Repeat with second baking sheet. Cool tartlets on a wire rack before serving, about 10 minutes.
