Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Peel, core and cube the apples. Lightly grease a 13x9 inch baking pan. Cover the bottom with half of the bread cubes and then sprinkle on half of the apples. Repeat with the remaining bread and apples. In a large mixing bowl combine the eggs, cream, sugar, milk and cinnamon; beat well. Pour this mixture evenly over the bread cubes and apples. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 minutes. Serve hot.
