Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium casserole dish. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add noodles, cook for 6 to 8 minutes, until al dente, and drain. Place turkey in a skillet over medium heat, and cook until evenly brown. Drain grease. In a bowl, gently mix cooked noodles and turkey, corn, and soup. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to the prepared baking dish. Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly.
