Beat together the egg and water in a bowl. Brush the puff pastry shells with the egg mixture, and bake shells according to package directions. Melt the preserves in a saucepan over low heat. Remove from heat, and stir in the strawberry slices. In a food processor, blend the kiwis and honey until smooth. In a large bowl, beat together the cream and sugar until stiff peaks form. Fill each puff pastry shell with strawberries, drizzle with kiwi sauce, and top with whipped cream to serve.
