Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine dry ingredients and set aside. In a separate bowl, beat butter and sugar together until light. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in dry ingredients 1/2 cup at a time. Add almonds, if desired. Roll into one inch balls and arrange 1 inch apart on ungreased baking sheet. Bake 11 to 14 minutes.
