Wash and dry catfish filets. Place filets in a shallow dish and pour milk over them. Cover and refrigerate for 6 hours or overnight. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, cheese, Italian seasoning, baking powder, garlic powder, dry mustard, onion powder, salt and pepper. Dredge filets in flour mixture. Lightly grease a rimmed baking sheet and place coated filets in pan. Drizzle melted butter over filets. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, or until firm and flaky. Serve hot.
