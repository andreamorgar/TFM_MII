Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease cookie sheets. Mix together flour, cinnamon, baking soda and salt in medium bowl. Beat brown sugar and 1/2 cup butter in large mixer bowl until creamy. Beat in egg. Gradually beat in flour mixture alternately with apple juice. Stir in 1 1/2 cups butterscotch chips, apple and 1/2 cup walnuts. Drop by slightly rounded tablespoon onto lightly greased cookie sheets. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until lightly browned. Let stand 2 minutes; cool on wire racks. While the cookies cool make the butterscotch glaze: Melt remaining butterscotch chips and 2 tablespoons butter in small, heavy saucepan over lowest possible heat. When the butter and chips have melted remove the pan from heat and stir in 1 cup confectioners' sugar and 1 1/2 tablespoon apple juice until the glaze is smooth. Spread the glaze on the cooled cookies and sprinkle with remaining walnuts.
