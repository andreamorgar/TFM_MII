Bring a pot of water to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer; add rosemary. Poach chicken in the hot water until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken with a slotted spoon and allow to cool. Discard broth. Chop chicken into chunks. Mix chicken, apple, celery, red onion, mayonnaise, chutney, lime juice, curry powder, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Chill in refrigerator to allow flavors to blend, at least 2 hours. Serve cold or at room temperature.
