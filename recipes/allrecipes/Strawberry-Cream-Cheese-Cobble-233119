Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Pour melted butter into the bottom of a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Mix milk, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a small bowl; pour over the butter in the baking dish. Arrange strawberry halves in a layer into the baking dish. Dot the strawberries with the cream cheese pieces. Bake in preheated oven until top is golden brown and edges are bubbling, 30 to 45 minutes.
