Melt butter or margarine in 9 x 13 inch pan. Mix together the flour, sugar, and milk. Pour mixture into the pan. Spread peaches, including syrup, evenly around the pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 40 minutes, until the crust turns golden brown. Let cool for about 10 minutes before serving.
