Melt the chocolate with the cream in a double boiler over medium-low heat, stirring constantly until the mixture is smooth; remove from heat and set aside to cool. Whisk the eggs and vanilla extract together in a large bowl until combined; stir the condensed milk into the mixture. Slowly pour the whiskey into the egg mixture while stirring until completely incorporated. Add the chocolate mixture and the espresso; beat with the whisk until the mixture is uniform in color. Pour into a bottle, cap, and chill in refrigerator at least 4 hours before enjoying. Store in refrigerator.
