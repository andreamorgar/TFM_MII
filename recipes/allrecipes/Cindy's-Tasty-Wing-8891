Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut the chicken wings into individual pieces and place on a lightly greased cookie sheet (you may need two cookie sheets). Spread apricot preserves over wings. Sprinkle dry onion soup mix over wings, then pour Catalina dressing all over. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour.
