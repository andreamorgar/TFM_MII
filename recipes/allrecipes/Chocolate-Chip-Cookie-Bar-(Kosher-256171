Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish and line with parchment paper. Beat butter in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and fluffy; add brown sugar and beat until creamy. Beat eggs, 1 at a time, into creamed butter mixture, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla extract. Sift flour and salt together in a bowl; slowly stir into the creamed butter mixture just until dough is mixed. Fold chocolate chips and pecans into the dough; press into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and edges begin to crisp, 25 to 30 minutes.
