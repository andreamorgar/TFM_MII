Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. In a 9x13 inch baking dish combine soup, eggs, milk, half of the cheese, cooked macaroni, salt and pepper. Mix well and then top with remaining cheese. Cover and bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove cover and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes, until top is lightly browned.
