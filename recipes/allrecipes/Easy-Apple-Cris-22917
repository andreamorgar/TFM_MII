Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread pie filling in an 8x8 inch baking dish. Sprinkle with cinnamon and nutmeg. Cream together margarine and sugar. Cut in flour with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle mixture over pie filling. Bake in preheated oven 20 minutes, until topping is brown and crisp and filling is hot and bubbly.
