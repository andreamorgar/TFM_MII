Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the onion, bell pepper, and mushrooms in the butter for 2 to 3 minutes; stir in the garlic, diced tomatoes, oregano, basil, ground mustard, curry powder, and red pepper; continue to cook until the onions are translucent and the mushrooms are golden brown, about 5 minutes; set aside. Combine the beef, veal, sausage, egg, 3 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, 1/4 cup ketchup, mustard, and teriyaki in a bowl; mix gently with your hands. Fold in the mushroom mixture and breadcrumbs. Shape the resulting mixture into a loaf and move to a baking dish. Lay the bacon slices on top of the loaf. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes. While the meat loaf bakes, prepare the glaze by whisking together the 1/3 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce, and yellow mustard in a bowl. Pour the glaze over the loaf and return to oven for another 10 minutes. Allow meat loaf to rest for 5 minutes before serving.
