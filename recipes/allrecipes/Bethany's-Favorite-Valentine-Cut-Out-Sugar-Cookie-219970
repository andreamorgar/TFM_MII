Cream together the butter, sugar, egg, milk, vanilla extract, and almond extract in a large bowl. Stir in the flour and baking powder. Cover and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Divide the dough into thirds. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each portion to 1/4-inch thick. Cut cookies out using a floured cookie cutter. Arrange cookies on an ungreased baking sheet about 1-inch apart. Bake until cookies are lightly golden, 6 to 9 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
