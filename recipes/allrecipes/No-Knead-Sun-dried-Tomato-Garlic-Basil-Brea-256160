Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Add warm water and olive oil; stir with a wooden spoon until well blended. Slowly mix in remaining 1 cup flour until dough holds together and isn't sticky. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until doubled in size, about 3 hours. Dust a baking sheet with cornmeal. Punch dough down and stir in sun-dried tomatoes, basil, and garlic using a wooden spoon or with your hands. Form dough into a loaf and place on the prepared baking sheet. Let dough rise in a warm area of the kitchen for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven until loaf is golden brown, about 30 minutes.
