Stir cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until smooth. Pour chicken broth into a large pot and stir cornstarch mixture, soy sauce, fish sauce, rice vinegar, chile-garlic sauce, vegetable oil, ginger, garlic, and coriander into broth. Cover and bring to a boil. Place rice noodles in the boiling sauce, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until noodles are tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir zucchini, red bell pepper, and chicken into sauce. Bring back to a boil, cover, and simmer until vegetables are just become tender, about 5 more minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes to thicken. Serve garnished with crushed peanuts and cilantro.
