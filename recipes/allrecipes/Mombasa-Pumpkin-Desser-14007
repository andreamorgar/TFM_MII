Steam the pumpkin pieces for 5 to 10 minutes. Scoop flesh from skins. In a medium saucepan, combine the pumpkin flesh and sugar. Heat over medium-low temperature until sugar dissolves into the pumpkin. Add coconut and cardamom. Stir often. Cook until the mixture has thickened to thick pudding-like consistency.
