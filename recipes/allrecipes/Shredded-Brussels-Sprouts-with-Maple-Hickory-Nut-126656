Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Toast nuts in a small shallow baking pan until fragrant and a few shades darker, about 10 minutes. While nuts toast, melt 1 tablespoon butter and stir together with syrup and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add maple glaze to hot nuts and toss to coat. Holding each Brussels sprout by stem end, cut into very thin slices with slicer. Toss slices in a bowl to separate layers. Heat remaining 3 tablespoons butter in a 12- to 13-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then saute shredded sprouts with pepper and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, stirring, until sprouts are wilted but crisp-tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add vinegar and saute, stirring, 1 minute. Add hickory nuts and any glaze in baking pan and saute, stirring, 1 minute.
