Empty yogurt into mixing bowl. Add flour, sugar, oil, eggs, and yeast (or substitute one teaspoon baking powder) and mix until just combined. Pour into a greased and floured 13 inch round cake pan. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven, or until cake is golden brown and middle bounces bake when pushed with your finger. Cool and dust with confectioners' sugar. Variations: use flavored yogurt, or add some fruit preserves to the mix to make a fruity cake, berry flavors work especially well. Variation 2: Use half brown sugar and half granulated sugar, and add 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. Enjoy!
