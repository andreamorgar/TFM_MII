Beat heavy cream with an electric mixer in a chilled metal bowl until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Set whipped cream aside. Scoop vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry ice cream into a large serving bowl. Sprinkle with bananas and spread whipped cream over bananas and ice cream. Drizzle with chocolate and caramel toppings and scatter candy sprinkles over the sundae. Decorate with lit sparkler fireworks, say the Pledge of Allegiance, and serve.
