Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly butter a 9x13 inch casserole dish. Cover the bottom of the prepared casserole dish with half of the banana slices. Sprinkle the bananas with half the brown sugar, butter pieces, pecans, and raisins. Form another layer with the remaining banana slices and repeat layering with remaining brown sugar, butter, pecans, and raisins. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes; remove from oven and cool for 5 minutes. Sprinkle brandy over top of dish to serve.
