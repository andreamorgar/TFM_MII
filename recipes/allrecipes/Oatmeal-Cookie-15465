Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a medium bowl, cream the margarine with the brown sugar and white sugar. Stir in the egg and vanilla. Sift together the flour, baking soda and cinnamon; add to the creamed mixture and stir until just combined. Finally, mix in the oats, raisins, pineapple and walnuts. Drop dough by heaping teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheet. Cookies should be about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool for a few minutes on the cookie sheet before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
