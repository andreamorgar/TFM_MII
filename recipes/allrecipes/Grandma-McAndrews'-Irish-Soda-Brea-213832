Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet, or line with parchment paper. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. In another bowl, whisk together eggs, buttermilk, and corn oil. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture, and pour in the buttermilk mixture. Add the raisins, and stir a few times, just until the ingredients come together into a soft dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and with floured hands shape dough into a ball. Place the dough on the prepared baking sheet, and cut a large cross in the top with a sharp knife. Place the bread on a middle rack of the preheated oven, and bake until golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes.
