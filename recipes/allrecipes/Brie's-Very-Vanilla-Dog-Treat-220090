Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 large baking sheets. Mix the whole wheat flour, cornmeal, rolled oats, and baking powder together in a bowl. Lightly mix the water, applesauce, and vanilla extract into the flour mixture. Stir the eggs and peanut butter into the mixture. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead until no longer sticky, about 1 minute. Roll out the dough to 1/4-inch thickness; cut into 75 small squares and arrange onto baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Turn the oven off and allow the treats to sit in the oven as it cools another 30 minutes. Remove the treats from the oven; allow the treats to cool on the baking sheets for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
