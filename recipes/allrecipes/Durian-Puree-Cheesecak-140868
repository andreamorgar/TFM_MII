Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (170 degrees C). If not using canned or frozen durian puree, cut into husk of a durian fruit and remove one segment of the pulpy inner flesh. Place in a bowl and use a fork to mash the flesh. Reserve 1/4 cup. Beat the cream cheese until fluffy. Add the condensed milk and continue beating until smooth. Beat in pureed durian, eggs, sour cream, vanilla extract, and durian or banana extract. Pour the batter into prepared graham cracker crust. Bake 1 hour or until filling is set and edges are lightly browned. Serve warm or chill overnight in the refrigerator.
