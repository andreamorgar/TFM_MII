Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Sift the cocoa powder through a fine strainer to eliminate lumps. Combine it with the flour, white sugar, ground almonds, cinnamon, cloves and baking soda. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the honey and 1/4 cup of the water. Stir until a smooth, sticky dough forms. Allow to stand for 1 minute to absorb the liquid. Turn the dough out onto a generously floured surface and pat it into a 6X12 inch rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Flour the dough lightly and roll over it once or twice with a rolling pin to even it out. Cut the dough into 1 1/2 inch strips, then cut the strips diagonally to make diamond shapes and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 15 minutes. Remove from pan to cool. To Make The Icing: Mix the confectioners' sugar with the remaining 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Brush over the cooled cookies. The icing will crystallize and harden as it dries.
