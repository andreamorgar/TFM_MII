Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread potato slices out on baking sheet. Coat with olive oil and salt. Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until tops are golden and edges are crispy, 15 to 20 minutes. Layer baked potatoes with Cheddar cheese; continue baking until cheese is melted, 5 to 10 minutes.
