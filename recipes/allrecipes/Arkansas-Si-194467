Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, ham, onions and jalapeno peppers. Cut a circle out of the top of the bread, and remove the center leaving a 1 inch shell of bread. Fill bread with the cheese mixture. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until the dip is heated through. Serve with crackers for a wonderful taste experience!
