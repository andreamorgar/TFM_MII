Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans and line with waxed paper. Mix flour and baking powder in a bowl. Beat white sugar, butter, and gelatin together in a separate bowl until fluffy; add eggs, one at a time, beating well with each addition. Stir alternately flour mixture then milk, into sugar mixture to form a smooth batter. Stir vanilla extract and strawberries into batter until combined. Divide batter between prepared cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of both cakes comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes; cool completely. Stir cream cheese, white chocolate, and heavy whipping cream in a saucepan over medium heat until combined and white chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Stir confectioners' sugar into cream cheese mixture until a smooth frosting forms. Allow to cool and set. Spread a layer of frosting over the top of one cake. Place the second cake on top of frosting layer. Frost the top of second cake and sides of both cakes with remaining frosting.
