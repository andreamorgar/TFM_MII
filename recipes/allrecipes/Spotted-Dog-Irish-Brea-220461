Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 12-inch cast iron skillet. Sift flour, sugar, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Beat eggs with milk in a separate bowl. Stir egg mixture into flour mixture until moistened; batter will be very thick. Fold in raisins until thoroughly combined. Spread batter into prepared cast iron skillet. Bake in the preheated oven until bread has risen and is golden brown on top, about 1 hour.
