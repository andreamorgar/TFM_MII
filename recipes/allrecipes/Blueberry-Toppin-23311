Place blueberries in a large stockpot and crush with a potato masher. Add water and lemon peel; simmer over low heat for 5 minutes. Strain fruit through cheese cloth, metal strainer or food mill to remove pulp and seeds; reserve juice. In a large saucepan, mix sugar and 4 cups water. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, until temperature reaches 260 degrees F (125 degrees C). Add blueberry juice and boil for 1 minute. Stir in lemon juice and remove from heat. Let cool and freeze or can as desired.
