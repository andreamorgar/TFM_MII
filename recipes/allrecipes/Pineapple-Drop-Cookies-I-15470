Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet. In a medium bowl, cream together the brown sugar and butter. Beat in the eggs and vanilla. Combine the flour and baking powder, stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, fold in the pineapple, raisins and nuts. Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto the prepared pan. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until edges are light brown. Remove from the baking sheet to cool on wire racks.
