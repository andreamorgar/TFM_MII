Dissolve gelatin and salt in boiling water. Drain pears and reserve 3/4 cup liquid. Dice pears and set aside. Add pear syrup and lemon juice to gelatin. Place 1-1/4 cups gelatin mixture in a 1 quart mold. Chill until firm but not completely set. Soften cream cheese and add to remaining gelatin and ginger. Blend until smooth. Fold in pears, spoon into mold and chill until firm. Unmold on crisp lettuce.
