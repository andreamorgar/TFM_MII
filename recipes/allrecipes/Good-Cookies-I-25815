Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In the microwave or in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water, melt the semisweet chocolate, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from heat and set aside to cool slightly. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Mix in the melted chocolate and peanut butter. Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and instant pudding mix; gradually blend into the peanut butter mixture. Stir in the oats and chopped peanut butter cups. Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
