Combine the brown sugar and cinnamon in a large bowl. Whisk in the softened cream cheese, yogurt, and vanilla until smooth. Stir the apples, 1 1/2 cups of walnuts, and the dried cranberries into the cream cheese mixture until well coated. Spoon salad into a serving bowl and garnish with the remaining 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts. Keep chilled until serving.
