In a cocktail shaker filled with ice, combine vodka and sweet and sour. Shake well, then strain into a tall glass full of ice. Fill the glass with carbonated water. Cut orange slice into quarters. On a cocktail sword, spear cherry first, then spear orange slice through the peel. Hang sword from the rim of the glass, so that fruit is in the drink.
