Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.) In a large bowl, combine 1 cup flour, margarine and confectioners' sugar. Mix together until it forms a ball. Press into the bottom and sides of a 9 inch square pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until golden brown. In a saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cup sugar, 3 tablespoons flour, yolks and milk. Stir together, then add chopped rhubarb. Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Pour into hot crust. In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add 1/4 cup sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Spread meringue over rhubarb filling, covering completely. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown.
