Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Sprinkle raisins into the bottom of each tart shell. Beat egg, maple syrup, brown sugar, melted butter, and salt together in a bowl until smooth; pour into tart shells to about 2/3 full. Bake in preheated oven until set, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes.
