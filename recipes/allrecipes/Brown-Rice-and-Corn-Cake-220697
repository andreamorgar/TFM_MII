Combine corn, rice, milk, eggs, and chives in a large bowl. Mix flour, baking powder, nutmeg, salt, and black pepper together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into corn mixture until well combined. Heat olive oil on a griddle or a large skillet over medium heat. Scoop 1/4-cup portions of corn mixture onto heated griddle. Cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
