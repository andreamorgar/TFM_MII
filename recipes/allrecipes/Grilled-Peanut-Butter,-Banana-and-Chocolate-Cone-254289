Prepare outdoor grill for medium heat. Place 1 tablespoon morsels in each cone; top each with 1 tablespoon peanut butter. Divide banana slices among cones. Loosely wrap each filled cone with aluminum foil. Place cones on side on grill and heat 5 minutes or until morsels melt, turning on other side after 3 minutes. Remove wrapped cones from grill; let aluminum foil cool. Remove foil and top each with a serving of Reddi-wip.
