Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion in the hot oil until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer onion to a bowl. Cook and stir rib-eye in the same skillet until meat is no longer red and liquid is evaporated, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir onion into cooked rib-eye. Bring a pot of water to a boil; cook hot dogs in the boiling water until cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes. Place each cooked hot dog into a bun. Spoon rib-eye mixture over hot dog; top with cheese spread.
