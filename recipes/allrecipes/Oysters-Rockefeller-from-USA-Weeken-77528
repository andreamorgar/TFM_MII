Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a small skillet, saute garlic in oil until soft; add spinach, cream cheese and half and half. Saute, stirring, until blended, about 5 minutes. Stir in salt, pepper and nutmeg. Spread spinach mixture over bottom of 10-inch pie plate or oven-proof dish. Top with oysters; sprinkle on cheese and hot sauce. Bake for 15 minutes. If needed, briefly broil to brown.
