Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a tube pan or a 9 x 13 inch baking pan. In a medium bowl combine oil, honey, tahini, baking powder and nutmeg; mix well. Stir in flour, sesame seeds and water. Pour into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.
