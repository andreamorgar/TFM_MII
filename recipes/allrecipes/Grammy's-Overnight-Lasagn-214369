Cook the ground beef in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until browned and no longer pink, about 5 minutes; drain fat. Stir in the marinara sauce, water, and salt. Bring to a boil. Remove sauce from heat. Arrange 6 noodles in a 9x13-inch baking dish, breaking if necessary to fit. Spoon 1/2 of the sauce over noodles. Top with 1/2 of the cottage cheese and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers with remaining noodles, sauce, cottage cheese, and mozzarella cheese. Top with Parmesan cheese. Cover tightly with foil; refrigerate overnight. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake lasagna, covered, until noodles are soft, cheese is melted, and sauce is bubbly, about 1 hour. Allow to sit for 10 minutes before serving.
