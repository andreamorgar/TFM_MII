Place the garlic, tahini paste, lemon juice, and olive oil into a blender or food processor. Blend until the garlic is finely minced, then add the garbanzo beans and chopped cucumber. Puree until smooth, then season to taste with salt and black pepper; blend to mix. Pour into a serving dish, and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours to allow the flavors to blend. Sprinkle with paprika before serving.
