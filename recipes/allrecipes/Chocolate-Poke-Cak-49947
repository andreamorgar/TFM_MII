Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch springform pan. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking soda, and baking powder. Make a well in the center, and pour in melted chocolate, coffee, sour cream, and oil. Mix well, and spread into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes, then remove from pan. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine caramels and milk. Heat in microwave until melted. Stir until smooth. With a wooden spoon, poke holes into the cake. Pour caramel mixture into holes.
