Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat butter and 1 cup sugar together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy. Add egg and beat until smooth. Stir molasses into the butter mixture until completely integrated. Sift flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, salt, and cloves together in a separate bowl; add to the butter mixture and mix until you have a dough. Divide and shape the dough into 36 balls. Put 1/2 cup sugar in a wide, shallow bowl. Roll dough balls in sugar to coat and arrange onto a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until beginning to crisp around the edges, 13 to 15 minutes.
