Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Combine flour and margarine in a medium size mixing bowl. Mix in sugar, cinnamon and baking powder. Stir the egg into the mixture. Once the egg is well incorporated stir in the coconut, raisins and vanilla. Drop the dough in rough heaps the size of an egg onto cookie sheets. Bake 8 minutes or until lightly browned.
