Rinse chicken with cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Cut into 1x1x1/2 inch pieces. Fill a deep fryer with corn oil, no more than 1/3 full. Heat to medium heat. Place egg and water in a small bowl and mix well. Add the flour, sesame seeds and salt, stirring until a smooth batter is formed. Dip chicken pieces in batter and drain off any excess. Add battered chicken, a few pieces at a time, to the hot oil. Fry about 4 minutes or until golden brown and done (remove chicken from oil to test). Drain on paper towels.
