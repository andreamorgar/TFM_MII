Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Scrub Jerusalem artichoke tubers and cut out eyes. Cut tubers into 1-inch pieces. Mix olive oil, thyme, garlic, and sea salt together in a large bowl; add Jerusalem artichoke pieces and toss to coat. Arrange coated pieces in one evenly-spaced layer on a baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven until Jerusalem artichokes are tender, 35 to 45 minutes.
