Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 36 muffin cups or line with paper liners. Mix bananas, white sugar, zucchini, applesauce, eggs, brown sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, and baking powder in a sifter and sift into the banana mixture; add oats and mix until batter is just combined. Fill muffin cups with batter. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool muffins completely in the tin before removing.
