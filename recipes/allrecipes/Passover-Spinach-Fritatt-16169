Heat the spinach in a saucepan with 1/2 cup of water, until completely thawed. Strain the spinach, reserving half the amount of liquid. Crumble the matzo into a medium-size mixing bowl and pour the spinach and the remaining liquid over them. Mix thoroughly until the matzo are softened. Add the Parmesan, eggs, salt, nutmeg and pepper. Heat the margarine in a 12 inch skillet and add the spinach mixture. Cook on medium heat, uncovered for 5 minutes on each side. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan and serve immediately.
