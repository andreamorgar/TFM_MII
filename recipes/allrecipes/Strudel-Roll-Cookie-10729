In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, butter or margarine, and sour cream into a soft dough. Chill one hour. To Make Filling: Combine the raisins, coconut, chopped nuts, and sesame seeds. Roll out one third of the dough to a thin sheet. Spread with one third of the jam. Sprinkle one third of the filling on the jam. Roll into a log jellyroll-fashion. Repeat two more times. Cut rolls into 1 - 2 inch cookies and place on greased cookie sheets. Place cookies on a greased cookie sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar while still warm.
