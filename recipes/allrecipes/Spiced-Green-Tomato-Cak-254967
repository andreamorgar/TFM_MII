Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Mix flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and salt together in a large bowl. Add green tomatoes, applesauce, eggs, and vanilla extract; stir batter to combine. Pour batter into prepared baking pan; spread evenly. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 60 minutes.
