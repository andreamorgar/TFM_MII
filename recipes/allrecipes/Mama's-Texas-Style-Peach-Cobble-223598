Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix self-rising flour and sugar in a bowl. Stir milk into the flour mixture. Pour melted butter in an oven-safe bowl. Pour flour mixture over melted butter. Layer peaches in heavy syrup atop flour mixture. Do not stir! Bake in preheated oven until peaches are bubbly and crust is lightly browned, 50 to 60 minutes.
