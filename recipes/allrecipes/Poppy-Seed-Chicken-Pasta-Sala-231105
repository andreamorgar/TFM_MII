Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 12 minutes; drain, rinse in cold water, and drain again. Toss pasta, chicken, onion, cranberries, celery, and almonds together in a salad bowl; drizzle with poppy seed dressing and stir to coat.
