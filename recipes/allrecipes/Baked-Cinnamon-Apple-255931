Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Layer apple slices in the bottom of an 8-inch glass baking dish. Mix water, butter, flour, and cornstarch together in a bowl until no lumps remain. Stir in brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt until smooth. Pour apples in the baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 10 to 15 minutes, until soft and juicy, about 45 minutes.
