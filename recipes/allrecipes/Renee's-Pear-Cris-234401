Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread pears to cover bottom of the baking dish; drizzle with melted butter and maple syrup. Stir flour, brown sugar, white sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Cut softened butter into flour mixture until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, adding more flour if necessary. Sprinkle topping over pears. Bake in preheated oven until pears are bubbling and topping is crisp, about 30 minutes.
