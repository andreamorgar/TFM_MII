Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Melt chocolate over low heat and let cool. In a large glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites until foamy. Slowly add salt and sugar a little at a time, until mixture stands in peaks. Stir in vanilla. Fold in chocolate, coconut and nuts. Drop by teaspoonfuls about 2 inches apart on cookie sheets. Bake 10 to 12 minutes. Cookies should be soft in the center.
