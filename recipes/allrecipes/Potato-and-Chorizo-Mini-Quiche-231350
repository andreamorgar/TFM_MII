Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly coat 24 mini-muffin cups with cooking spray. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Cook and stir chorizo in the hot oil until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Stir diced potato into chorizo; increase heat to medium and cook potatoes until tender, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Sprinkle 1 to 2 teaspoons of grated cheese in the bottom of each muffin cup. Top with 1 to 2 tablespoons chorizo mixture. Beat eggs, cayenne pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl until combined. Pour egg mixture evenly into muffin cups. Lightly tap the pans to remove any air bubbles. Transfer to a baking sheet and top with any remaining cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until eggs golden brown and just set, about 17 minutes.
