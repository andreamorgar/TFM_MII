Cook ground beef and onion in a skillet over medium heat until beef is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain excess grease from the skillet. While beef cooks, stir taco seasoning mix into water in a small saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir taco seasoning mixture into ground beef and onion mixture; simmer on medium-low heat while preparing the remaining ingredients. Stir refried beans and cubed process cheese food together in a separate small saucepan over medium-low heat; cook and stir until cheese food has melted completely into the beans, about 10 minutes. Divide refried bean mixture between flour tortillas; spread into an even layer to cover one side completely. Wrap tortillas around the crisp taco shells, using bean mixture to stick the tortillas to the shells. Spoon seasoned ground beef into the taco shells.
