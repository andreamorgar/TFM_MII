Stir sugar, cinnamon, chili powder, and black pepper in a shallow bowl until thoroughly combined. Pour canola oil into a separate bowl. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Dip tortilla squares into canola oil on both sides and press into the seasoned sugar mixture; arrange coated chips on baking sheets. Broil chips until sugar bubbles and chips are crisp, about 2 minutes; watch carefully to prevent burning. Turn the chips over and broil other sides until browned, another 2 minutes. Let cool before serving.
