Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk flour, cocoa powder, and baking soda together in a bowl. Blend applesauce and kale together in a blender until smooth, about 30 seconds. Beat sugar, butter, egg white, and vanilla together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Stir kale mixture, canola oil, and honey into creamed butter mixture. Stir flour mixture into kale mixture until dough is just mixed; fold in chocolate chips. Drop spoonfuls of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated until edges are slightly hardened, 10 to 12 minutes.
