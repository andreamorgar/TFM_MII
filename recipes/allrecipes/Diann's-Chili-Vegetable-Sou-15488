In a large soup pot, saute ground beef until brown. Drain excess fat. Add celery, onions, green bell peppers, cabbage, kidney beans, vegetable juice, tomato juice, corn, diced tomatoes and chili powder. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover pot and let simmer about one hour, or until celery is tender. Add garlic powder and salt and pepper to taste.
