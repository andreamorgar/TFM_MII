Place cauliflower into a pan of lightly salted boiling water. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes, or until tender. Remove from heat, drain and cool. Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C). In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and milk with a fork. Place cracker crumbs in a shallow dish. Dip cauliflower in the egg mixture then roll in cracker crumbs. Fry coated cauliflower in the hot oil until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
