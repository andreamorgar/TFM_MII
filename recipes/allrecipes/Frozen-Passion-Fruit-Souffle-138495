Prepare ramekins: Cut paper into 6 (13- by 2 1/2-inch) strips. Wrap a strip tightly around outside of each ramekin to form a 1-inch collar and tape overlapping ends together. Arrange ramekins on a 9-inch baking pan. Make souffles: Sprinkle gelatin over lime juice in a small saucepan and let soften 1 minute. Stir in passion fruit pulp and heat over moderately low heat, stirring, until gelatin is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a metal bowl, then set bowl in a larger bowl of ice and cold water and quick-chill mixture, stirring occasionally, until it begins to thicken, about 10 minutes. Heat sugar and water in a 1-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring, until sugar is dissolved, then wash down crystals from side of pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water. Boil without stirring until syrup registers 238 degrees F on thermometer, about 5 minutes. While syrup is boiling, beat egg whites with a pinch of salt in mixer at medium speed until stiff peaks form. Pour syrup in a slow stream down side of mixer bowl, beating constantly at high speed, and continue beating until meringue is room temperature, 4 to 5 minutes. Whisk cream in a chilled bowl until soft peaks form. Whisk one fourth of meringue into passion fruit pulp to lighten, then fold pulp into remaining meringue along with whipped cream. Spoon into ramekins, filling them 1/3 to 1 inch above rims. Freeze until firm, then cover with plastic wrap and freeze at least 2 hours. Let souffles soften in refrigerator about 20 minutes before serving.
