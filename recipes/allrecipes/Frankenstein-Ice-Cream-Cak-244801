Put ice cream in the refrigerator to soften while you make whipped cream frosting. Beat cream in a bowl using an electric mixer until stiff peaks almost form. Add white sugar, whipped cream stabilizer, vanilla extract, and green food coloring to whipped cream; beat until stiff peaks form. Scoop softened ice cream into a large bowl; stir until a uniform consistency is reached. The ice cream shouldn't be completely melted, but firm enough to hold form. Scoop ice cream into the loaf pan and spread evenly using a spatula, trying to avoid creating air bubbles. Mix crushed cookies and melted butter together in a bowl. Pat cookie mixture the ice cream for the "hair"; freeze for 5 hours. Run a knife along the edges of the pan and carefully flip it upside-down over a cake platter. Return cake to the freezer until firm, at least 30 minutes. Spread whipped cream evenly over the top and sides of cake. Freeze cake until solid, about 1 hour more. Spoon hot fudge sauce onto the cake creating "eyes", a "mouth", and "hairline"; top hot fudge areas with sprinkles. Place 1 cookie on each side of the bottom of the cake for the "neck bolts". Freeze cake until ready to eat.
