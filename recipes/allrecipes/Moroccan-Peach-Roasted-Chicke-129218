Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). In a glass measuring cup, combine the margarine, honey, rose water, salt and pepper. Heat in the microwave until margarine has melted, about 30 seconds. Place chicken in a baking dish and pour the margarine mixture over it. Stir to coat the chicken completely. Place the dish of chicken into the oven. Cook uncovered in the preheated oven until chicken pieces have browned, about 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add the peaches to the dish and sprinkle with sugar. Continue to roast until chicken is cooked through, about 20 more minutes. Remove chicken pieces to a serving dish and pour the juices from the pan over them. Garnish with slivered almonds.
