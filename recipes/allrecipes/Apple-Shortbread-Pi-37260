Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C.) Sift four, 1/2 cup sugar and salt into a large bowl. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Fold in egg yolks (mixture will be crumbly). Remove 1/4 of mixture, and set aside. Press remainder onto bottom and sides an 8 inch tart shell or pie pan. In a large bowl, combine apples, brown sugar, 1 tablespoon flour, cinnamon and nutmeg. Place apples into crust, and sprinkle reserved crumb mixture evenly over top. Place pie on a baking sheet, and bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking 20 minutes, or until top is golden brown and filling is bubbling.
