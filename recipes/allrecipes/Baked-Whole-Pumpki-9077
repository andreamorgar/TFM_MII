Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut the lid off the pumpkin and remove the seeds. Combine the eggs, whipping cream, brown sugar, molasses, nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger. Pour mixture into the pumpkin shell and top the butter. Replace lid on pumpkin and place in a baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 to 1-1/2 hours or until mixture has set like a custard. Serve right from the pumpkin at the table, scraping some of the meat from the pumpkin wall with each serving.
