Preheat the pizzelle iron. In a medium bowl, mix together the eggs and sugar. Slowly add melted butter, vanilla, and anise extract, while mixing. Stir in the flour, baking powder, and anise seeds. If a thicker cookie is preferred, add 1/2 cup more flour. Drop cookies by rounded tablespoons onto the center of the grid. Close the iron and cook until steaming stops. This could take 30 to 90 seconds, depending on the iron used.
