Grease and flour a 9 x 5 inch pan well. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large mixing bowl, sift together sugar, flour, cinnamon, salt, and baking soda. In a smaller bowl, beat the eggs and oil. Stir in pecans and strawberries. Add egg mixture to the sifted ingredients, and stir until just combined. Bake for 1 hour, or until tester inserted in the center comes out clean.
