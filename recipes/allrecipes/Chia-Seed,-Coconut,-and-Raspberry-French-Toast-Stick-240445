Cut each bread slice into 4 even sticks. Mix coconut, chia seeds, half-and-half, eggs, sugar, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl until batter is smooth. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add butter. Dip bread sticks in the batter until completely coated. Cook coated bread sticks in the hot butter until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Place raspberries in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until softened, about 1 minutes. Mix yogurt into raspberries. Dip French toast sticks in raspberry-yogurt sauce and top with maple syrup.
