Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch tube pan. Mix white sugar and cinnamon in a plastic bag. Cut pizza dough into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Shake 6 to 8 pieces of dough in the sugar-cinnamon mix. Arrange pieces in bottom of prepared pan. Continue until all dough pieces are coated and placed in pan. Arrange nuts and raisins in and among dough pieces. Melt butter and brown sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Boil for 1 minute. Pour over dough; let rise for 30 minutes. Bake in preheated oven until bread is golden brown, about 35 minutes. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a plate. Pull apart pieces of bread to eat.
