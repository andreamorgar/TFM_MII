Mix together the ground pork, celery, carrot, onion, and garlic in a bowl. Season with salt, pepper, and soy sauce; mix with your hands until well blended. Separate the wonton wrappers and lay them out on a clean surface. Spoon 1 teaspoon of the pork mixture into the center of each wrapper. Moisten the edges of the wonton wrappers with beaten egg, fold over the filling to form a triangle, and press together to seal. Place the finished wontons on a baking sheet. Heat the canola oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C). Fry the wontons, about 6 at a time, until they turn golden brown and float to the top, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove, and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
