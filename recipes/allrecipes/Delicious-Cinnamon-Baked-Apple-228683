Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large baking dish with the butter. Mix brown sugar, vanilla sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a small bowl. Layer about 1/3 of the apples in prepared baking dish; sprinkle with 1/3 of the sugar mixture. Repeat layers twice more. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Pour water over apples and continue baking until tender, about 15 minutes more.
