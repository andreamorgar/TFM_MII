Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish. Tear the buns into pieces, and combine with onion, celery, sage, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Lightly stir in the egg and 1/2 cup of chicken broth, and mix gently until thoroughly combined but not mushy. Slice each pork chop through the side to make a pocket. Stuff the pocket of the pork chop with stuffing mixture, and place into the prepared baking dish. Pour 1 cup of chicken broth between the pork chops into the dish without pouring it on top of the chops. Bake in the preheated oven until the chops are tender and no longer pink in the center, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
