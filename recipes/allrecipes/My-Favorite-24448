Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a medium bowl, cream together the shortening, butter and confectioners' sugar until smooth. Stir in the vanilla and almond extracts. Combine the flour and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Roll into walnut sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until bottoms begin to brown.
