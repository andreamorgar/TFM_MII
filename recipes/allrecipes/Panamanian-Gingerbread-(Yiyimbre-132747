Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease and flour a 15x20-inch baking dish. Whisk together the flour, salt, and baking powder in a bowl. Mix together the shortening, ginger, and molasses until smooth. Stir in the flour mixture until no dry lumps remain. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes. Cut into 2-inch squares. Cool 2 to 3 more hours before serving.
