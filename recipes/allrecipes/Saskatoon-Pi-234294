Bring saskatoon berries and water to a simmer; cook for 15 minutes. Drain any excess water; set aside to cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk 1/2 cup sugar and tapioca together in a bowl. Stir tapioca mixture and lemon juice into berries. Line a 9-inch pie plate with a single crust; pour berry mixture into crust. Dot berries with butter. Place top crust over berries; crimp edges of pie together tightly. Brush top of pie with egg white. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove pie from oven, sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar, and return to the oven until pie is golden and filling is bubbly, about 10 minutes.
