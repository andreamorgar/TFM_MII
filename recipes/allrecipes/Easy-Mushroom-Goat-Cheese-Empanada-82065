Adjust oven rack to center; heat oven to 450 degrees. Heat oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Add mushrooms, stirring until moisture evaporates, about 5 minutes. Stir in chilies, garlic, cilantro, salt and pepper. Cook 2 minutes longer. Transfer to a medium bowl; stir in goat cheese until cheese melts. Cool to room temperature. Separate biscuits onto a cornmeal-coated work surface. Sprinkle with cornmeal as necessary, and roll each one into a 5 inch circle. Fill each one, using a scant 2 Tbs. filling and leaving a 1/2-inch border. Place on cookie sheets lined with parchment paper. (At this point, can be frozen up to 2 weeks.) Brush tops with oil. Bake until golden, 16 to 20 minutes (longer if frozen). Makes 20.
