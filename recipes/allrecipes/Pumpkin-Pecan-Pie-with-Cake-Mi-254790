Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 9-inch pie pans with waxed paper. Stir pumpkin filling, sugar, evaporated milk, eggs, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl; pour into prepared pans. Sprinkle cake mix over top; cover with chopped pecans. Drizzle melted butter evenly over the surface. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes; chill in the refrigerator. Flip the pan over onto a plate to remove the pie; cut into wedges.
