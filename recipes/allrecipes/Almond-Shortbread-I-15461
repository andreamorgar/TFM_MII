In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and confectioners' sugar until very light. Gradually add the cornstarch, all purpose flour and nutmeg. Stir until well blended. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead for a few turns. Divide the mixture into 2 parts. Roll each part into a roll about 6 inches (15 cm) long. Wrap the rolls in plastic wrap or wax paper, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. These can be refrigerated for up to 1 week. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Unwrap the rolls and slice into 1/2 inch thick slices. Place onto the prepared cookie sheets. Gently press an almond onto the top of each cookie. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven. When cookies are cooled, store in an airtight tin to preserve crispness.
