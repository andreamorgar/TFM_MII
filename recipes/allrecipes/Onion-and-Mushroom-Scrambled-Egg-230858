Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms, onion, and garlic until onion is browned, about 15 minutes. Season with Italian seasoning. Beat eggs with garlic and herb cheese spread in a bowl. Mixture will be slightly chunky. Season with salt and black pepper. Pour eggs in skillet over mushroom mixture; cook and stir until eggs are nearly set, about 1 minute. Fold mozzarella cheese into eggs until just melted, about 30 seconds.
