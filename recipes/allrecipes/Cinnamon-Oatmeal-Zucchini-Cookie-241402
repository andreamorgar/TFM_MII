Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease baking sheets. Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl until light and fluffy; add eggs and vanilla extract and continue beating until smooth. Stir flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture and stir until well-blended. Add zucchini, oats, pecans, and cinnamon chips, respectively, mixing well after each addition. Drop dough by heaping tablespoonfuls 2-inches apart onto prepared baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
