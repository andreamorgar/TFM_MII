Cook and stir bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crispy, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, discarding most of the grease. Return skillet to the stove and add olive oil; heat over medium heat. Add potatoes, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until browned and somewhat crispy, about 10 minutes. Mix onion into potatoes and cook until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Return bacon to the skillet; cook and stir until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour eggs over potato mixture; cook and stir until eggs are set, 5 to 6 minutes.
