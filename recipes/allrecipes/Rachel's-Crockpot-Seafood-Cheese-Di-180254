Combine processed cheese food, cream cheese, sour cream, shrimp, crab, and lobster in a crockpot. Cover and cook on Low heat until cheese is melted, about 1 hour, stirring occasionally to break up lumps. Once the cheese is melted, stir in seafood seasoning and Worcestershire sauce. Serve with French bread.
