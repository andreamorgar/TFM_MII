Combine marshmallows and butter in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir until melted and smooth, about 5 minutes. Combine caramels and half-and-half in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until melted, about 2 minutes. Arrange apple slices on a large serving dish. Drizzle marshmallow mixture over the apples. Drizzle caramel sauce and chocolate syrup on top. Garnish with chopped nuts.
