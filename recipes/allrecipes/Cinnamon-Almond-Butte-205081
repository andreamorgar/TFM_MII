Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread the almonds into a single layer on a baking sheet. Roast the almonds in the preheated oven until dark brown, about 8 minutes. Be careful to not overcook. Allow to cool completely before proceeding. Blend the almonds in a blender until thick and creamy, 8 to 10 minutes. The mixture will be very dry initially and then begin to clump. Scrape the sides of the blender with a rubber spatula as needed to keep the almonds blending. Add the white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt; continue blending until completely smooth. Store in refrigerator.
