Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Unroll crescent roll dough on work surface and separate into 4 rectangles, pressing perforations together to seal. Cut each rectangle into 2 smaller rectangles. Place 1 slice of mozzarella cheese on each; roll up tightly and press edges together to seal. Arrange seam side-down on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 11 to 13 minutes. Warm pizza sauce in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, about 5 minutes. Use warmed sauce as a dipping sauce for mozzarella sticks.
