In a saucepan, bring the chicken broth to a boil with the kasha. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Bring pot of lightly-salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain and rinse with cold water. Pour the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the onions in the oil until lightly browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir the drained pasta and kasha into the onions, and season to taste with salt and pepper.
