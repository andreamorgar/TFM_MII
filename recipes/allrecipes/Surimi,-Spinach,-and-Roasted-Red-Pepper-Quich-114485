Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Press the pie crust into a 9 inch glass pie plate, and press fingers along the upper edge to decorate. Bake in preheated oven until the crust is very lightly browned, about 12 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk together the eggs, cream, garlic powder, pepper, salt, and hot pepper sauce in a bowl until well blended. Fold in the surimi, green onions, roasted peppers, spinach, Cheddar cheese, and Parmesan cheese. Pour into the pie crust. Return to the oven, and bake 20 minutes. Turn the oven off, and leave the quiche in the oven until slightly firm, 20 to 30 minutes.
