Cube potatoes, if desired you may peel them. Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Cook over medium heat until potatoes are tender. Drain and place cooked potatoes in a large bowl. Mash potatoes with butter and salt and pepper to taste. Once mashed stir in the mayonnaise, mustard and sour cream, mixing well. Stir in the celery, onion, pickles and green pepper. Serve warm or at room temperature.
