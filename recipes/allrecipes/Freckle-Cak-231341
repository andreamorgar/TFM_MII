Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as a Bundt(R)). Beat yellow cake mix, vanilla pudding mix, eggs, vegetable oil, and water in a bowl with an electric mixer to make a smooth batter, about 2 minutes. Stir grated chocolate and chocolate chips into batter and pour into prepared tube pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Let cool completely in the pan before turning out onto a cake plate.
