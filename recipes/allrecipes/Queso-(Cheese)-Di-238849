Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place poblano peppers, Anaheim peppers, and jalapeno pepper, cut-sides down, on the prepared baking sheet. Cook peppers under the preheated broiler until the skin of the peppers has blackened and blistered, 5 to 8 minutes. Place the blackened peppers into a bowl and tightly seal with plastic wrap. Allow the peppers to steam as they cool, about 20 minutes. Remove and discard skins; dice peppers. Combine diced peppers, cheese food cubes, tomatoes, onion, butter, and cumin in a slow cooker. Cook on Low, gradually adding cream, until cheese melts and dip is heated through, about 30 minutes.
