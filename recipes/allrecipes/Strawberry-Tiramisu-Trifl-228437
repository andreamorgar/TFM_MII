Stir instant coffee granules and water together in a bowl until dissolved. Let cool. Beat cottage cheese, cream, and confectioners' sugar together in a separate bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Brush each ladyfinger cookie with coffee. Arrange a few ladyfingers in the bottom of 4 serving glasses. Spread a layer of cream filling atop the ladyfingers. Layer a few strawberry slices atop cream filling. Repeat with remaining ladyfingers, cream filling, and sliced strawberries, ending with a layer of cream filling. Garnish each glass with a whole strawberry.
