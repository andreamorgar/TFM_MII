Set a large skillet over medium-high heat and coat with cooking spray. Add ham and onion; cook and stir until onion is clear. Add the tomatoes and turnip greens and cover the skillet. I use a 12 inch skillet and I have to pack the greens down a bit to make them fit at first. When the pan starts to steam, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for about 12 minutes. Transfer the greens and ham to a serving bowl and toss with apple cider vinegar.
