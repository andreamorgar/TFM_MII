Stir together bourbon, chopped mint, and sugar in a small bowl. Let stand 20 minutes (to allow flavors to develop). Meanwhile, trim, peel, quarter, and core pineapple, then cut crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices and transfer to a bowl. Pour bourbon mixture through a sieve onto pineapple. Add whole mint leaves and gently toss to combine.
