Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, 3 tablespoons white sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl; press into a pie pan. Bake crust in preheated oven until set, 6 to 8 minutes. Spread 3/4 cup caramel ice cream topping over the pie crust. Sprinkle 1 cup chopped pecans over the caramel. Refrigerate until the caramel is set, at least 15 minutes. Melt 5 tablespoons butter in a saucepan. Stir brown sugar and salt into the butter; add apples and stir to coat. Cook until apples are fork-tender, 10 to 15 minutes; transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until completely cool, at least 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat cream cheese, white sugar, egg, lemon juice, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth. Spread chilled apple mixture over the caramel and pecans in the pie crust; top with the cream cheese layer. Bake in preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Let pie cool completely, at least 30 minutes. Top pie with whipped topping. Drizzle 1/4 cup caramel ice cream topping over the pie. Sprinkle 1/4 cup pecans over the caramel and whipped topping.
