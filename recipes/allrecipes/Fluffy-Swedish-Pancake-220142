Blend eggs, milk, warm water, white sugar, flour, and salt together in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer until well combined into a smooth batter. Stream the melted butter into the batter while continuing to beat. Heat a skillet or crepe pan over medium heat. Coat the cooking surface with a thin layer of butter. Pour a thin layer of batter onto the prepared cooking surface; swirl the pan to assure even coverage. Cook the crepe until browned on the bottom, 1 to 2 minutes; flip the crepe and continue cooking until the other side is browned. Serve immediately.
