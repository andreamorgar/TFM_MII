In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, bread, eggs, cheese, parsley and onion and season with salt and pepper to taste. For meatballs: Form mixture into golf size balls and brown in a large skillet over medium heat for 5 to 10 minutes, or until well browned. Add to your favorite spaghetti sauce and simmer until meatballs are completely cooked through, about 15 to 20 minutes. For meatloaf: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add 3 tablespoons ketchup to mixture, mix well, form into a loaf and place in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 75 to 90 minutes. For burgers: Add 3 to 4 tablespoons steak sauce to mixture, mix well and form into patties. Saute in a large skillet over medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or to desired doneness.
