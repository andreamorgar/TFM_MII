Whisk sugar, cocoa powder, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, and salt together in a small bowl. Bring milk to a boil in a saucepan, whisking constantly. Whisk in cocoa mixture until dissolved, reduce heat to low, and simmer until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract. Stir cream into hot chocolate and pour into mugs.
