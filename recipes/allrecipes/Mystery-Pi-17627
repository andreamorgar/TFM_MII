Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 9 inch pie pan. In a large glass or metal bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Mix together sugar and baking powder, then slowly add mixture to egg whites, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Beat in vanilla extract. Fold in crushed crackers and pecans. Spread mixture evenly into pie pan. Place pie in preheated oven and reduce temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bake for 30 minutes. Cool thoroughly. Top with whipped topping and fresh fruit.
