Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch round glass baking dish. Mix flour, milk, raisins, sugar, caraway seeds, vegetable oil, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl until dough is not wet enough to pour and not dry enough to handle. Add more milk if dough is too dry. Transfer dough to the baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes.
