Place the ground beef into a skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring to crumble, until no longer pink. Drain off fat and stir sloppy joe sauce into the beef. Warm the nacho cheese dip in the microwave until liquid. Pile the tortilla chips onto a serving platter. Spoon the ground beef over them and pour the cheese sauce over the top. Serve immediately.
