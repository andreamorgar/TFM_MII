Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine the cooked shredded chicken with salsa, cumin, and oregano in a large bowl. Prepare Knorr(R) Fiesta Sides(TM) - Mexican Rice according to package directions. Remove from the heat. Stir rice and shredded cheese into the chicken mixture. Divide the mixture among flour tortillas; wrap and place seam-side down on a lined baking sheet. Brush with oil. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown and crispy, about 20 minutes. Serve, if desired, with your favorite toppings.
