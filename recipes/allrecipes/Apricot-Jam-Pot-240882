Mix flour, butter, confectioners' sugar, and cornstarch together in a bowl until dough is just mixed; refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 6 dozen miniature muffin cups with paper liners. Roll dough into small balls and press each ball into the bottom and up the sides of each muffin cup. Fill each cup 3/4-full with apricot preserves. Mix coconut, white sugar, and eggs together in a bowl; spoon over apricot filling, making sure to cover completely. Bake in the preheated oven until topping is lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes.
