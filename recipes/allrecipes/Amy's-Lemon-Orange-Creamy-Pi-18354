Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium bowl combine 1 1/2 cups sugar, cornstarch, water, egg yolks and salt. Cook mixture in a saucepan over medium heat for 6 minutes, stirring constantly until it reaches a thick and creamy consistency; remove from heat. Add to mixture the orange juice, butter and lemonade-flavored drink mix. Pour into a 9 inch pie dish. In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat until whites form stiff peaks. Spread meringue over pie, covering completely. Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) oven for 8 minutes. Remove from oven; cover and chill for one hour.
