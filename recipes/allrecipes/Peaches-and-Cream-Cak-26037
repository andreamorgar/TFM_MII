Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 (9 inch) round pans. In a large bowl, stir together cake mix and pudding mix. Make a well in the center and pour in sour cream, oil and eggs. Beat on low speed until blended. Scrape bowl, and beat 4 minutes on medium speed. Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool completely. Make Filling: In a large bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar, alternating with milk. Beat in cinnamon and vanilla until light and fluffy. Assemble the cake: Slice cakes horizontally to make 4 layers. Reserve 8 peach slices for garnish; chop remaining peaches. Fill each layer with 1/3 cup frosting mixture and 1/2 cup chopped peaches. Frost top and sides of cake with remaining frosting. Garnish with sliced peaches.
