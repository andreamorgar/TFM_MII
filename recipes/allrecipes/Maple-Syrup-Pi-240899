Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Press pie crust into an 8-inch pie dish. Mix maple syrup, brown sugar, evaporated milk, and eggs together in a bowl; pour into pie crust. Bake in the preheated oven until mostly set in the middle, about 45 minutes. Cool pie until middle has begun to completely set, about 30 minutes more.
