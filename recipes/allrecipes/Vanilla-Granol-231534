Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Lightly spray large baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray. Mix oats, almonds, sweetener, salt, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Stir applesauce and sugar together in a small saucepan; bring to a simmer over medium heat and immediately remove from heat. Stir vanilla into the applesauce mixture; pour over the oats mixture and toss to coat. Spread the mixture onto the prepared baking dish. Bake until golden brown, stirring occasionally, 20 to 30 minutes. Place baking sheet on a cooling rack until granola is completely cooled.
