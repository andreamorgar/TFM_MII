Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Whisk Parmesan cheese, paprika, parsley, salt, and pepper together in a shallow dish. Coat tilapia fillets with olive oil and press into the Parmesan cheese mixture. Arrange coated fillets on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 12 minutes.
