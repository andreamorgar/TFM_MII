Heat the vegetable oil in a stock pot over medium heat. Cook and stir the onion, celery, and carrots in the hot oil until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the chicken broth, baking potatoes, thyme, and poultry seasoning to the vegetable mixture; bring to a simmer and continue cooking until the potatoes are cooked through, about 15 minutes. Stir the cooked chicken, egg noodles, and evaporated milk into the soup; cook until the noodles are cooked through, another 7 to 10 minutes.
