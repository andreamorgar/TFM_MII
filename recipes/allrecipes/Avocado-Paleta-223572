Bring water and sugar to a boil together in a saucepan; stir continually until sugar dissolves. Set aside to cool. Pour sugar-water mixture into a blender with avocados, lime juice, and salt; blend until smooth. Pour the mixture into 10 ice pop molds. Freeze until solid yet still soft, about 2 hours; insert wooden sticks and continue freezing until firm, 12 to 24 hours.
