Mix the brown sugar together with the butter and orange peel in a mixing bowl until evenly blended. Use immediately, or cover and refrigerate for up to 1 month. To make 1 serving, place 1 rounded tablespoon of the brown sugar mixture into a mug. Add the rum and boiling water, and stir until the mixture is completely dissolved.
