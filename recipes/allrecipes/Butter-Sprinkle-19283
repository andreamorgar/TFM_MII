In a large bowl, cream together the butter, white sugar, confectioners' sugar and canola oil until smooth. Mix in the vanilla and eggs. Combine the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar and salt; stir into the sugar mixture until smooth. Cover and chill dough for at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls. Dip the top of each ball into the colored sprinkles. Place the cookies 2 inches apart onto the cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
