Heat vegetable oil in a heavy pot over medium heat. Cook and stir cardamom pods and chickpea flour in hot oil until you smell a roasted aroma from the flour, about 5 minutes. Add dry milk powder and continue to cook and stir until mixture is golden brown, about 5 minutes more. Beat eggs and sugar in a bowl until well mixed. Stir egg mixture into milk mixture. Cook and stir until the oil begins to separate from the milk, about 5 minutes. Transfer mixture to a bowl and sprinkle with almonds.
