Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 2-quart casserole dish with cooking spray. Mix blackberries, 1/4 cup coconut sugar, and 2 tablespoons gluten-free flour together in a bowl until blackberries are coated; pour into the prepared dish. Mix 1 cup gluten-free flour, 1 cup coconut sugar, buttermilk, coconut flour, butter, baking powder, xanthan gum, sea salt, vanilla extract, and nutmeg together in a bowl; spread over blackberry mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until set and golden, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly before serving.
