Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8 inch baking dish. Mix the apples, pears, cranberries, 1 tablespoon flour, honey, and lemon juice in the prepared dish. In a bowl, mix 1/2 cup flour, brown sugar, oats, walnuts, and butter to the consistency of coarse crumbs. Sprinkle loosely over the fruit mixture. Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until brown and crisp on top.
