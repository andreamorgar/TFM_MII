Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir dates and white sugar in the melted butter until thick and golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and stir in crispy rice cereal and pecans. Let mixture cool until easily handled, 5 to 10 minutes. Form mixture into small balls using your hands. Pour confectioners' sugar into a resealable bag; add date-nut balls and lightly shake bag until balls are coated.
