Beat butter, peanut butter, barley malt syrup, and white sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Beat eggs into creamed butter mixture until smooth. Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl; stir into creamed butter mixture until dough is just mixed. Refrigerate dough for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Roll dough into 1-inch balls and arrange on baking sheets. Flatten each ball using a fork, making a crisscross pattern. Bake in the preheated until edges of cookies are browned, about 10 minutes.
