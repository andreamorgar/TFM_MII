Cook macaroni in a large pan of boiling water until al dente. Drain, and rinse. Set aside. Place nuts in a dry skillet. Toast over medium heat, turning frequently, until nuts are fragrant and lightly browned. In a large bowl, combine pasta, chicken, pineapple, apples, celery, mandarin oranges, and toasted nuts. In a small bowl, mix together mayonnaise, reserved pineapple juice, and almond flavoring. Stir into pasta mixture, and mix well. Chill.
