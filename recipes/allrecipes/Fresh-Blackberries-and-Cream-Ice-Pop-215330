Place the blackberries into a blender or food processor. Cover and puree until the mixture is smooth. Pour the blackberry puree through a fine sieve placed over a large bowl to strain out the seeds. Add the softened frozen yogurt and sugar to the strained blackberry puree and mix well. Pour into ice pop molds, and freeze.
