Peel onions, and cut each one into quarters, keeping onion together. Place one tablespoon of butter and one whole clove of garlic into the center of each one. Double wrap each onion in aluminum foil and drop into the hot coals of your campfire. Cook for 30 to 40 minutes. Carefully remove them from the coals and tear them open. Season with salt to taste, and eat.
