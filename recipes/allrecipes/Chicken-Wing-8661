Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Melt butter or margarine and stir in mustard. Place bread crumbs in a flat dish. Roll each chicken piece in the butter mixture, then coat with bread crumbs. Place chicken pieces in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle with cheese and bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Turn and bake 15 minutes longer, or until crispy.
