Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Whisk milk, eggs, sugar, salt, and vanilla together in a bowl until completely combined. Pour egg mixture into 6 custard cups; sprinkle tops with nutmeg. Place cups in a baking pan and fill pan with enough hot water to reach halfway up the sides of the custard cups. Bake in the preheated oven until custards are set, about 1 hour. Cool completely.
