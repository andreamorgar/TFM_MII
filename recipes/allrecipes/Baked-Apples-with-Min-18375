Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Core apples and peel off a 1 inch strip around the hole on the top of each apple. Place apples in a shallow baking dish. Combine raisins, brown sugar, and mint leaves. Fill apples with the raisin mixture. Top the raisin filling in each apple with 1 teaspoon butter. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 50 minutes, until apples are tender.
