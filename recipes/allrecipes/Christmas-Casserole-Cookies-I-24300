Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl beat eggs with an electric mixer. Beat in sugar. Stir in dates, coconut, walnuts, vanilla and almond extract. Spoon mixture into a 2-quart casserole dish. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove from oven, and while mixture is still hot, beat well with a wooden spoon. When mixture is cool enough to handle, form into small balls and roll in granulated sugar.
