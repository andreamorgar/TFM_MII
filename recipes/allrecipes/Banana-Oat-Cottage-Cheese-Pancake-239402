Preheat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat. Blend oatmeal, protein powder, brown sugar, cinnamon, and baking powder in a blender until fine; dump into a large bowl. Blend banana, eggs, cottage cheese, and vanilla extract in a blender until smooth; pour into bowl with dry ingredients and mix into a thick batter. Stir water into the batter to thin slightly, as desired. Ladle between 1/4 to 1/2 cup batter per pancake onto the preheated cooking surface. Cook until browned on the bottom, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip pancakes and continue cooking until browned on the other side and the center is set, 3 to 5 minutes more.
