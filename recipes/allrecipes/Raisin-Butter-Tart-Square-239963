Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place raisins in a cup; pour in hot water to cover, and set aside to soak, about 5 minutes. Place 1 1/2 cups flour in a large bowl; cut in 1/2 cup butter until crumbly. Stir 1/4 cup brown sugar into flour mixture; press mixture evenly into the bottom of a 9x9-inch pan. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, leaving oven on. Beat 1 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup butter together until smooth; stir in egg, vanilla extract, and cream. Strain raisins; stir raisins and 1 tablespoon flour into butter mixture. Pour raisin mixture over crust. Bake in the preheated oven until filling is bubbly, about 20 minutes. Allow to cool before cutting into squares, about 30 minutes.
