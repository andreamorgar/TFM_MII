Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 10x15-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Place oats in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until finely ground. Place ghee in a microwave-safe bowl; cook in the microwave until melted, 15 to 30 seconds. Add ground oats, walnuts, 2/3 cup coconut sugar, 1 tablespoon coconut flour, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, and pinch salt to melted ghee; toss until coarse crumb mixture forms. Combine gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, 1 cup coconut sugar, flax seed meal, 2 tablespoons cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, xanthan gum, ginger, pumpkin pie spice, 1 teaspoon sea salt, and cloves together in a large bowl. Whisk applesauce, olive oil, eggs, honey, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Add to flour mixture; mix well until thick batter forms. Pour batter into prepared baking dish. Top evenly with crumb mixture, pressing gently into batter. Bake in preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.
