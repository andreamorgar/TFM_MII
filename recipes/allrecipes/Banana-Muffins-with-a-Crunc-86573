Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners. In a bowl, mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix in the eggs, milk, vanilla, and butter. Fold in mashed bananas, chopped banana, granola, walnuts, and coconut. Scoop into the prepared muffin cups. Sprinkle with banana chips. Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.
