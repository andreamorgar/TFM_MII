Prepare batter and bake cake as directed on the package. About 5 minutes before the cake is finished baking, melt the butter in a large saucepan to allow for foaming, and stir in the evaporated milk. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, and stir in the corn syrup and sugar. Bring back to a boil, stir to dissolve sugar, turn off the heat, and add the baking soda. Stir continuously until the baking soda is mixed in and stops foaming, about 2 minutes. Remove the cake from the oven, and poke holes in the hot cake with a butter knife or the end of a wooden spoon. Pour the syrup over the hot cake, and let cool before cutting.
