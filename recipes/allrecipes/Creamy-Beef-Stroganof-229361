Crumble ground beef into a large skillet over medium heat; sprinkle with seasoned salt. Cook and stir until completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain excess grease from skillet and return to heat. Stir onion, nutmeg, and cloves into the beef. Whisk hot water and flour together in a bowl until smooth; pour over beef mixture and mix. Stir mushroom soup into the beef mixture. Place a cover on the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low. Stirring occasionally, cook at a simmer until thickened, about 30 minutes. Whisk sour cream, parsley, and dry mustard together in a bowl. Stir sour cream mixture into the beef mixture; season with salt and black pepper. Continue cooking at a simmer uncovered until hot, 15 to 20 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes; drain. Transfer noodles to a large bowl. Ladle beef mixture over the noodles and mix.
