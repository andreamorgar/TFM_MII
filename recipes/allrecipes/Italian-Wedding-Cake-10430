Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine 1 cup sugar, 2 eggs and 1 cup milk. Add baking powder, 3 1/2 cups flour, and salt. Then add warmed, melted shortening and almond flavoring. Flour a cookie sheet (no grease) and drop cookie batter from a teaspoon onto sheet. Bake for 10-15 minutes. Cookies will be cake-like. Be sure to bake them on center rack. To Make Frosting: Mix together confectioners' sugar, 1 tablespoon almond flavoring, water and 2 tablespoons of melted butter. Stir and frost cooled cookies.
