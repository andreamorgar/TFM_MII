In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder and nutmeg. Cut in shortening using a pastry cutter until the mixture is crumbly. Add enough milk to the eggs to make 1 full cup. Stir into the flour mixture. Mix in currants. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Preheat a griddle to medium high heat and lightly oil. On a floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thickness and cut into circles using a cookie cutter. Fry cookies on both sides until golden. Cool on wire racks.
