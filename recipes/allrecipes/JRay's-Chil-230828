Break ground beef into a large stock pot over medium-high heat; cook and stir until completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain fat from the beef and return pot to heat. Stir tomato sauce, light red kidney beans, dark red kidney beans, salsa, celery, onion, bell pepper, jalapeno pepper, chili seasoning, bacon, garlic, oregano, basil, salt, black pepper, and sugar with the ground beef in the pot. Place a cover on the pot and cook the chili until the flavors have blended, at least 1 hour.
