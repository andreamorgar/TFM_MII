Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spread bread cubes in 2 large shallow baking pans and bake, stirring occasionally and switching position of pans halfway through baking, until dry, 20 to 25 minutes total. Transfer bread to a large bowl. 3While bread is drying in oven, cook onions in 1/2 stick butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 20 minutes, then add garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, 1 minute. Add onion mixture to bread, reserving skillet. Add turnips, broth, and 2 tablespoons butter to skillet, then simmer, covered, until tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F and butter a 13- by 9-inch baking dish (3-quart capacity). Add turnip mixture, parsley, salt, and pepper to bread and toss until combined well. Spoon stuffing into baking dish. Cut remaining 2 tablespoons butter into bits and dot over top of stuffing. Bake stuffing, covered tightly with a sheet of buttered foil (buttered side down), in upper third of oven until heated through, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove foil and bake stuffing until top is lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes more. Stuffing can be assembled (but not baked) 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.
