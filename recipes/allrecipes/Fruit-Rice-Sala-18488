In a saucepan bring salted water to a boil. Add rice, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer--without stirring--for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and chill until cold. In a medium bowl, mix together pineapple, strawberries, peaches, a heaping cup of the cold rice, raisins and coconut. Set aside. In a separate large bowl, whip together cream, sugar, vanilla, ginger and salt until stiff. Fold in rice mixture, and stir in 1/4 cup slivered almonds. Spoon mixture onto lettuce leaf beds, and sprinkle each portion with 1/4 cup sliced almonds.
