Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Place mushrooms, gill-side up, on a work surface; fill each with 1 ounce blue cheese. Cook mushrooms, blue cheese-side up, on the preheated grill, rotating every 5 minutes, until mushrooms are tender and cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.
