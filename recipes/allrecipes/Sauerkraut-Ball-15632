Sift together baking powder, flour, salt, and mace. In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine eggs, milk, and melted butter or margarine. Stir the flour mixture into the egg mixture until smooth. Fold sauerkraut into the dough. Heat 4 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large skillet. Drop the sauerkraut dough by teaspoonful into the hot oil; fry until the balls are browned on all sides, approximately 2 or 3 minutes.
