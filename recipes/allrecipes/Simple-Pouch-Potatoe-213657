Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray four sheets of aluminum foil with cooking spray. Divide potatoes evenly among the sheets of aluminum foil; season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and oregano. Place 2 tablespoons of the butter flavored spread over each mound of potatoes. Create packets by folding and sealing the aluminum foil. Place the foil packets on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and easily pierced with a fork, 55 minutes to 1 hour. Drain melted butter-flavored spread before serving.
