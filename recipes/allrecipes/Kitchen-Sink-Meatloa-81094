In a bowl, stir together the egg, ketchup, barbeque sauce, steak sauce, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, onion, and garlic, seasoned salt, and salt and pepper. Mix in ground beef, bread crumbs, and Cheddar cheese. Spread into the loaf pan. Bake 55 minutes in the preheated oven, to a minimum internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
