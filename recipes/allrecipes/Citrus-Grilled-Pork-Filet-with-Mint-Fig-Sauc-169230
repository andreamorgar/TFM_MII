Whisk together 1 cup orange juice, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and the minced garlic in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the pork chops, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours. Place the figs and mint leaves into a blender, and blend until pureed. Add the balsamic vinegar, 3 tablespoons olive oil, honey, and 1/2 cup orange juice to the blender, and puree until smooth and thick. Season to taste with sea salt and pepper, then set aside. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the pork from the marinade. Discard the remaining marinade. Wrap each pork chop with a slice of bacon, securing with toothpicks as necessary; season with salt and pepper. Grill the pork chops until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Pour the mint-fig sauce over the pork chops to serve.
