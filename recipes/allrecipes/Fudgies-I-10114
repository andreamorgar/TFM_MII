Cream the butter until light. Gradually beat in the white and brown sugar ( on low speed with a mixer if using one ) until creamy and light. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Melt the chocolate in a small, heavy saucepan over very low heat. Stir chocolate into the butter mixture. Slowly stir in the salt and flour. Combine thoroughly. Stir in walnuts, if desired. Shape into walnut-sized balls. Make an indentation with your thumb in each cookie. Bake at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) for 10 to 12 minutes until just done. Cool on rack.
