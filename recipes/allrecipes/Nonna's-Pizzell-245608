Preheat pizzelle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Mix flour and baking powder together in a bowl. Combine eggs and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and beat on medium speed until well-blended. Add 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons shortening and beat until blended. Add flour mixture and mix on medium speed until incorporated. Fold anise seeds and vanilla extract into batter with a spatula. Drop a teaspoon of batter onto the preheated iron. Bake until golden, 30 to 40 seconds, or a few seconds longer for darker pizzelle.
