Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)). Combine yellow cake mix, pineapple, water, eggs, oil, coconut extract, and vanilla extract in a bowl until moistened; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until batter is smooth, about 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes clean, 40 to 45 minutes.
