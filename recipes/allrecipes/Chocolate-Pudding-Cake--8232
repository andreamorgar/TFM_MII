Tear angel food cake into bite size pieces into a 9x13 inch cake pan (preferably glass). Prepare chocolate pudding as directed on package. Gently spread over the top of cake pieces, spreading to edges of pan. Carefully spread whipped topping over chocolate pudding, spreading to edges of pan and taking care not to mix with pudding. Using a cheese grater or vegetable peeler, grate chocolate bar over the whipped topping. Chill until ready to serve, at least one hour.
