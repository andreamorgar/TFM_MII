Heat oil for frying in deep-fryer or large, heavy saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet. Add garlic and onion, and saute for 2 minutes. Add bok choy and pea pods, and stir fry until the bok choy and pea pods are crisp-tender. In a large mixing bowl, combine crab, cream cheese, soy sauce and sauteed vegetable mixture. Drop mixture by 3/4 teaspoon into the center of a won ton wrapper. Fold the wrapper in half to make a triangle. Seal the wrapper around the mixture by wetting your finger with cold water and pressing the ends together. In batches, fry the dumplings in the prepared oil until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
