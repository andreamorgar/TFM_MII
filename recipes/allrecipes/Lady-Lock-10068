Cream together butter, margarine, cottage cheese, salt and 4 cups of flour. Shape into a large square, cover and chill overnight. Cut dough into 4 quarters. Roll each quarter out individually, about 1/8 inch thick. Cut into 8 inch strips, as wide as you like. Roll over tubes (I use clothespins covered with aluminum foil). Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) until brown. To make Filling: Cook milk and 4 tablespoons of flour until thick paste forms. Let cool completely. Beat shortening and confectioner's sugar until fluffy. Add marshmallow cream and vanilla. Then add COLD paste and beat. Fill tubes with cream filling. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar just before serving.
