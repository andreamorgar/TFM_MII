Cream together shortening and brown sugar. Stir in egg and molasses and mix well. Fold in dry ingredients and stir. Cover and chill until firm (1 - 2 hours). Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll dough into small balls (I use a small melon baller to help with this) and roll in white sugar. Place on lightly greased cookie sheets. Bake 9 - 10 minutes. Leave on cookie sheet one minute until set.
