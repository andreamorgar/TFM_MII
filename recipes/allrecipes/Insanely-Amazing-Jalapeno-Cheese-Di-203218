Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine jalapeno peppers, Parmesan cheese, Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, and green chilies in a bowl. Cut the top off of the sourdough bread and hollow out the center to create a bowl. Fill the bread bowl with the jalapeno mixture. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
