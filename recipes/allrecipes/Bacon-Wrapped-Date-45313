Preheat the broiler. Slice open dates, and stuff each with a cube of Cheddar cheese. Wrap each date with a quarter of a bacon slice, and secure bacon with toothpicks. Arrange wrapped dates on a medium baking sheet, and broil 15 minutes in the preheated oven, turning once, until bacon is evenly browned.
