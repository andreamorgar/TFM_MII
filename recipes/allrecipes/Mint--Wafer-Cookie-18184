In a small saucepan, combine the butter, brown sugar, water and mint chocolate chips. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally until melted. Transfer to a medium bowl and set aside to cool for about 10 minutes. Beat the eggs into the chocolate mixture one at a time. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt, stir into the chocolate mixture. Cover dough, and chill for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll dough into 1 inch balls and place 1 1/2 inches apart onto an unprepared cookie sheet. Bake for 12 to 13 minutes in the preheated oven. As soon as the cookies are out of the oven, place 1/2 of a mint candy on top of each one. Let sit for 30 seconds, then swirl with a toothpick. Cool on wire racks.
