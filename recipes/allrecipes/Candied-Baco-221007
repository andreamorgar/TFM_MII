Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix brown sugar, rice vinegar, maple syrup, and black pepper in a small bowl. Place bacon slices on cooling rack set over a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, turn slices, and bake another 5 minutes. Remove bacon and brush both sides with brown sugar mixture. Return bacon to the oven and bake another 5 minutes. Repeat basting every 5 minutes until bacon is browned and crisp, about 35 minutes.
