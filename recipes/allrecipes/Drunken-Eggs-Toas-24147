Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). In a mixing bowl, beat eggs well. Stir in Grand Marnier and nutmeg. Soak bread in eggs for 30 seconds on each side. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Grill bread until golden brown on both sides, about 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to baking sheet and bake until thoroughly cooked, about 2 to 3 minutes. Using a paring knife, cut a 2 to 3 inch pocket in one side of each slice of bread. Spoon cheese and preserves into the pockets. Arrange on plate and dust with powdered sugar. Serve with clarified butter and maple syrup.
