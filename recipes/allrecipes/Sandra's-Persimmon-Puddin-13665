Butter one 9x13 inch baking pan. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a blender, combine persimmon pulp, egg, sugar, flour, milk, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, salt and butter. Blend until smooth. Pour into baking pan and bake for 30 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out with just crumbs but no batter stuck to it.
