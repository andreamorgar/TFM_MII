Thaw the salmon slightly in cold water, and remove the skin. Use a very sharp knife to slice the fillet into thin slices. Place the slices in a bowl, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss with enough liquid smoke to coat the fish, and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the salmon slices for a few minutes turning once. Fish should flake easily with a fork when done.
