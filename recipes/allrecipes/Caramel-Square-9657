Preheat oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch square baking pan. Mix shortening and cake mix until smooth. Stir in 1/3 cup of the milk and peanuts; mix well. Mixture will be crumbly. Press half of mixture into baking pan and bake for 8 minutes. Over low heat, melt caramels and remaining 1/3 cup evaporated milk in the top of a double boiler or in a glass bowl in the microwave. Stir frequently until melted and smooth. Sprinkle chocolate chips over warm dough. Spread the caramel mixture over the chips. Sprinkle the remaining cake mix mixture over the top. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until the top is golden. Let cool before cutting into bars.
