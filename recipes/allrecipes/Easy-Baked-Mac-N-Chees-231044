Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain pasta and return to pot. Stir Alfredo sauce and 3/4 pound Cheddar cheese into pasta until cheese begins to melt. Pour pasta mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish; top with bread crumbs and 2 tablespoons Cheddar cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bread crumbs are golden brown, about 30 minutes.
