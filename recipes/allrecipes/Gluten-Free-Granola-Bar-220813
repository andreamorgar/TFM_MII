Mix syrup and peanut butter in a saucepan over low heat until smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Stir about half the chocolate chips into the syrup mixture. Mix remaining chocolate chips, almonds, cashews, oatmeal, crispy rice cereal, and flax seed meal in a bowl. Pour the mixture from the saucepan over the mixture in the bowl; stir to evenly coat. Transfer mixture to a 9x13-inch baking dish and press into an even layer; allow to cool completely before cutting into bars.
