Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease and flour one 15 1/2x 10 1/2 inch jelly roll pan. Mix sour cream, water and eggs. Stir in cake mix until moistened. You will notice the batter will be lumpy. Spread into pan. Drop pie filling by large spoonfuls onto batter. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 minutes or until cake tests done. Sprinkle cake with almonds and drizzle with glaze. To Make Glaze: Mix confectioner's sugar, milk and vegetable oil. Stir in a few extra drops of milk if necessary. Stir until mixture is smooth and of a desired consistency. Drizzle over still warm cake.
