Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one large loaf pan or one 10 inch tube pan. In a saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the milk and the butter. Do not boil. In a large bowl beat the eggs until light colored. Gradually add the sugar to the eggs then stir in the flour and baking powder. Stir in the hot milk and butter. Beat only until combined. Stir in the vanilla. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes. Let cake cool in pan for 10 minutes. Remove cake from the pan and cool on a wire rack.
