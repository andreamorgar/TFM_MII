Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour two 5x9-inch bread pans. Place strawberries in a bowl and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar. Mix whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, oats, 2/3 cup white sugar, baking powder, and cinnamon together in the bowl of a stand mixer. Stir bananas, eggs, and oil into strawberry mixture; pour into flour mixture. Beat mixture using the stand mixer until batter is just combined. Divide batter between the 2 prepared bread pans. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes.
