Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (170 degrees C). Cream the butter, sugar and eggs well. Add remaining ingredients and mix thoroughly. Pour batter into tart shells, no more than half full. Bake for 20 - 25 minutes. Watch carefully!!--they'll burn quickly. Filling will keep in the refrigerator for 2 weeks or so. Liquid coffee creamer can be used for cream. Use any good pie pastry for shells.
