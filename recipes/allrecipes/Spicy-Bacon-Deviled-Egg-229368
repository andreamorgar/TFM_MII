Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel. Slice eggs in half lengthwise. Remove yolks to a small bowl and mash; reserve hollow egg whites. Fry bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels and crumble. Reserve a small amount of bacon and Cheddar cheese in separate bowls; stir remainder into mashed egg yolks with mayonnaise. Stir in mustard and wasabi. Fill egg whites with a heaping spoonful of the yolk mixture. Sprinkle with reserved bacon and Cheddar cheese before serving.
