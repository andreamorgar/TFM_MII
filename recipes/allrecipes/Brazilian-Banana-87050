Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place the bananas into the baking dish. Combine the orange juice, lemon juice, sugar and salt in a pitcher or bowl; pour over the bananas. Dot with butter. Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Sprinkle with coconut before serving.
