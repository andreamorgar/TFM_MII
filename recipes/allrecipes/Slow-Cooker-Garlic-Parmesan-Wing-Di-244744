Mix butter and garlic in a skillet over medium-high heat until butter is melted. Add chicken; cook and stir until chicken is heated through, 2 to 4 minutes. Stir cream cheese, Parmesan salad dressing, and vinegar into chicken mixture; cook until well-blended and warm, about 5 minutes. Mix 1/2 of the Monterey Jack cheese and 1/2 of the Parmesan cheese into chicken mixture; transfer to a slow cooker. Sprinkle remaining Monterey Jack cheese and Parmesan cheese over dip. Cook on Low until hot and bubbling, 30 to 40 minutes.
