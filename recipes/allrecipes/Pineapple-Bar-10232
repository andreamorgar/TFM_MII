Cook until thickened, cool. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cream together shortening and sugar thoroughly. Stir in flour, baking soda and salt. Mix in rolled oats. Press and flatten half of the mixture over bottom of a 13 x 9 1/2 x 2 inch greased pan. Spread with cooled filling. Top with remaining crumb mixture, patting lightly.
