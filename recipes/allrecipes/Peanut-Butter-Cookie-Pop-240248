Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat butter, peanut butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until light and fluffy; add egg and vanilla and continue to beat until fully integrated. Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl; gradually mix into the peanut butter mixture until completely integrated into a dough. Divide dough into 12 equal portions. Insert a wooden stick into the small end of each candy bar. Wrap a dough piece around each candy bar to completely cover. Arrange the cookie pops 4 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 14 to 16 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets for 10 minutes before removing to a cooling rack to cool completely.
