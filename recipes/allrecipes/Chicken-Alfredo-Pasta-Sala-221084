Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken breasts onto a roasting pan; season with Italian seasoning, Cook chicken in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Set aside to cool completely. Cook and stir bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 10 minutes; drain on a paper towel-lined plate until cool. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotelle pasta at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Rinse the pasta in cold water until cooled; drain. Combine chicken, bacon, pasta, cucumber, tomatoes, black olives, artichoke hearts, and green onions in a large bowl. Pour vinegar and Alfredo sauce over the pasta mixture; stir to combine. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving.
