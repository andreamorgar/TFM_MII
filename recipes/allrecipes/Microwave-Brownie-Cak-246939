Microwave chocolate chips and butter in a microwave-safe mug until melted, about 20 seconds. Add brown sugar, white sugar, salt, baking soda, and vanilla extract; mix together until combined. Stir in egg yolk. Add flour; mix until batter is blended and smooth. Cook in the microwave until crust forms but center is still fudgy, about 35 seconds. Add 5 to 10 seconds for a drier consistency.
