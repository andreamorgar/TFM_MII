Soak beans overnight in water. Drain, rinse, and discard water. Combine soaked beans with 2 quarts fresh water. In a food processor or blender, process beans with water until smooth. Strain into a pot through a double layer of cheesecloth, or a fine sieve. Add pandan leaf or ginger, and sugar to taste. Boil soy milk for 15 minutes. Stir frequently to prevent skin from forming. Remove pandan leaf or ginger, then flavor with vanilla. Stir in sugar to taste. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate.
