Beat egg white with salt until foamy. Gradually add sugar, and continue beating until mixture forms stiff shiny peaks. Blend in flour and coconut. Combine cake mix, instant pudding mix, eggs, yolks, water, and oil in a large bowl. Blend, then beat with electric mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes. Pour 1/3 of the batter into a greased and floured Bundt pan. Spoon in coconut mixture, and top with remaining batter. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 to 55 minutes. Remove to wire rack, and cool thoroughly.
