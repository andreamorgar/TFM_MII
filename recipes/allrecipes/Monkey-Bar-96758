Set aside until needed. Stir the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a mixing bowl. In another mixing bowl, beat the butter and brown sugar together until light and fluffy. Beat in the banana, buttermilk, vanilla, and egg whites until well blended. Gradually add the flour mixture, beating just until combined. Stir in the raisin mixture and walnuts.
