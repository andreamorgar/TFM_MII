Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Combine applesauce, sugar, peanut butter, water, coffee-flavored liqueur, egg replacer, honey, and vanilla extract in a large bowl; mix until well-blended. Sift flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt together in another bowl. Stir into applesauce mixture. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle walnuts on top. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, 18 to 25 minutes.
