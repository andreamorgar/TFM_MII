Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a medium bowl, cream together the brown sugar and shortening until smooth. Stir in the egg, and then the applesauce until well blended. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves; stir into the applesauce mixture. Mix in walnuts and raisins. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until the edges start to brown. Cool on cookie sheets for a few minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
