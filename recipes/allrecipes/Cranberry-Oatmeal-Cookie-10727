Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Blend butter and sugar until fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla and mix well. In a separate bowl sift flour, baking soda, and salt together. Stir into butter mixture. Stir in the oats. Fold in nuts and cranberries. Drop spoonfuls of cookie dough onto ungreased cookie sheets, spaced at least 2 inches apart. These cookies spread. Bake 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until the edges are crisp and the centers appear dry. Cool on wire racks and enjoy.
