Wrap the bottom and sides of an 8-inch springform pan with aluminum foil. Combine graham cracker crumbs, butter, and salt in a bowl; mix thoroughly. Pour into the prepared pan; press tightly onto the bottom and up the sides of the pan using the bottom of a measuring cup. Freeze crust until firm, 10 to 15 minutes. Beat cream cheese, Neufchatel cheese, and 3/4 cup sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy, about 4 minutes. Beat in eggs one at a time; add vanilla. Beat in heavy cream. Melt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 2 minutes. Beat melted chocolate into the cream cheese mixture. Fold in flour. Pour chocolate cream cheese mixture over the chilled crust. Cover tightly with aluminum foil. Pour 1 1/2 cup water into the pot of an electric pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Place a metal trivet in the pot; set springform pan on top. Seal and bring cooker to high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; cook cheesecake for 45 minutes. Release pressure naturally according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool cheesecake to room temperature, about 1 hour. Combine cherries, apricot jam, and 2 tablespoons sugar in a saucepan over medium heat. Simmer until cherries are heated through and release some of their juices, 5 to 7 minutes. Mix water and cornstarch in a small bowl until smooth. Stir into the cherry mixture until thick and glossy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat; cool glaze to room temperature. Pour glaze over cheesecake and refrigerate until firm, at least 6 hours or overnight. Remove the springform ring and transfer cheesecake to a serving platter.
