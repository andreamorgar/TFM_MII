Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook according to package directions; drain and reserve. In a small saucepan, beat eggs with a wire whisk until foamy. Stir in reserved pineapple juice, lemon juice, sugar, butter and salt. Cook mixture over low heat until thickened and coats the spoon; stir constantly for 2 minutes and cool to room temperature. In a large bowl, combine pasta, pineapple, oranges, grapes and marshmallows; mix well. Fold in egg mixture and whipped cream; cover and chill. When chilled, stir mixture and garnish with cherries; serve.
