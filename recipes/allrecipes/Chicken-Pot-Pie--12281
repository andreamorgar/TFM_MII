Boil or steam the chicken breasts until done. Dice. Mix together undiluted soup, canned vegetables, and diced chicken. Pour mixture into pie shell, and cover with the second crust. Crimp the edges, and make slits in the top crust. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 minutes, or until crust is golden brown.
