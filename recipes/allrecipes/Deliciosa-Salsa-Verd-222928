Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Place tomatillos cut side down on a baking sheet. Broil in preheated oven until slightly charred, about 5 minutes. Transfer tomatillos to a food processor with cilantro, onion, jalapeno pepper, serrano pepper, lime juice, and sugar; pulse until well mixed.
