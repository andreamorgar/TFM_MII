Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Line the bottom and sides of two greased 9 x 5 x 3 inch loaf pans, and 1 round 4 1/2 inch x 3 inch deep pan with brown paper. Grease the paper. In a large bowl, stir together cherries, pineapple, raisins, mixed peel, 1 cup pecans, and 1 cup flour. Mix until fruit is coated with flour. In another large bowl, cream the butter or margarine and sugar together. Beat in eggs 1 at a time. Mix in orange juice and vanilla. Combine 5 cups flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Stir in floured fruit and nuts. Mix. Spoon batter into prepared pans. Fill each pan 3/4 full. Arrange split almonds over tops. Bake for about 3 hours, until toothpick comes out clean. Cover with foil if top gets too dark while baking.
