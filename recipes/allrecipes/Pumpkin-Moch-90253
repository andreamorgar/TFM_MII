Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sift together the mochiko, baking powder, and sugar in a large bowl. Mix together the eggs, pumpkin puree, condensed milk, butter, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Stir the egg mixture into the mochiko mixture. Pour into the prepared dish. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Allow to cool before serving.
