In a large pot with boiling salted water cook egg noodles until al dente. Drain. In a large skillet over medium heat oil. Add sliced mushrooms, green bell pepper, onion, and saute for 5 minutes. Stir in ground beef and brown; drain excess grease. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, parsley, Italian seasoning, dried oregano, cayenne pepper, salt, ground black pepper and sugar. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Stir occasionally. In a small bowl combine cream cheese, sour cream, finely chopped green onion, and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese.
