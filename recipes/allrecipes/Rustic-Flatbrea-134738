Place 1 1/2 cups warm water in large bowl; sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon yeast over. Let stand 5 minutes. Add 1 1/2 cups unbleached flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. Using wooden spoon, beat until well blended, about 2 minutes. Cover starter mixture with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature overnight. Stir starter to deflate. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour. Pour milk into large bowl of heavy-duty mixer fitted with paddle attachment. Whisk remaining 2 teaspoons yeast into milk. Let stand until yeast dissolves, about 10 minutes. Scrape starter into milk mixture. Stir in oil and salt. At low speed, mix in remaining 2 3/4 cups unbleached flour. Beat until dough pulls away from sides of bowl, about 6 minutes. Scrape dough off paddle attachment. Let dough rest in bowl 10 minutes. Turn dough out onto well-floured work surface (dough will be sticky). Knead with floured hands until smooth and elastic, about 2 minutes (dough will be soft). Lightly oil large bowl. Add dough; turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap, then towel. Let rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn dough out onto floured surface. Knead briefly until smooth. Divide dough in half. Let dough halves rest 5 minutes. Shape each half into log on work surface. Lightly flour each half; let rest 5 minutes longer. Lightly oil 2 heavy large baking sheets; sprinkle with cornmeal. Gently roll out each dough half into 14 x 6-inch rectangle, allowing dough to rest 3 minutes if dough springs back. Transfer each rectangle to prepared baking sheet. Lightly sprinkle tops with flour. Cover dough with lightly oiled plastic wrap, oiled side down. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled, about 30 minutes. Position 1 rack in bottom and 1 rack in top third of oven and preheat to 425 degrees F. Lightly sprinkle tops of dough with flour again. Press dough all over with fingertips to dimple. Cover with lightly oiled plastic wrap, oiled side down. Let dough rise until light and puffy, about 20 minutes. Bake breads until brown and crusty, about 30 minutes. Transfer breads to rack and cool slightly. (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Rewarm breads in 400 degrees F oven about 8 minutes, if desired.)
