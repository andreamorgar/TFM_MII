Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour one 9x13 inch pan. Combine cake mix, eggs, coffee liqueur and oil in large bowl and mix on medium speed for approximately 2 minutes. Pour into prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for approximately 25 minutes (may vary). Done when cake springs back to the touch or toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Set aside on cooling rack. To make pralines: combine butter and brown sugar in small saucepan. Heat on medium to medium high, stirring constantly. Bring to boil for 2 minutes, again stirring constantly. Pour in pecans and remove from heat. Stir, then immediately pour pralines over cake. Cool cake in refrigerator. To make frosting: combine pudding mix, milk, cream cheese, and nondairy whipped topping, and beat with electric mixer until well mixed. Spread on cake. Ready to serve!
