Put tomatoes in a bowl. Pour hot water over tomatoes and soak until softened, about 30 minutes; drain. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a loaf pan with cooking spray. Mix drained tomatoes, ground beef, bread crumbs, onion, basil, ketchup, provolone cheese, egg whites, and garlic together in a bowl; pack into prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
