Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch log mold (baking dish that looks like a half pipe) or small loaf pan. Use an electric mixer to beat the egg yolks and the sugar until light. In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites until a beater lifted from the whites leaves a peak that folds over on itself. Fold the beaten egg whites, grated apples, flour, and baking powder into the egg yolk and sugar mixture. Gently stir batter to blend well. Spread the dough into the greased baking pan. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Cool cake in pan before removing. Using an electric mixer, whip the cream in a chilled bowl until stiff peaks form. Serve cake with fresh berries and whipped cream.
