Stir cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth. Crumble cookies over cream cheese and mix using your hands. Form mixture into balls, arrange on a baking sheet, and insert a toothpick into each ball. Refrigerate until solid, at least 2 hours. Or freeze, 15 to 30 minutes. Melt almond bark in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave). Dip cookie balls in the melted bark and place on waxed paper to cool.
