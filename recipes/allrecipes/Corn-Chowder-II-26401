In a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until crisp. Drain, reserving 1 tablespoon of bacon grease. Place bacon grease in a large stock pot over medium heat. Cook bell pepper, onion and celery leaves in grease until just tender. Stir in bacon, corn and water and bring slowly to a boil, stirring frequently. Stir in milk and heat gently, without boiling. Serve hot.
