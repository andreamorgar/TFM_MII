Mix lemon pepper, thyme, parsley, rosemary, Cajun seasoning, and black pepper in a small bowl. Rub olive oil over chicken tenders. Arrange chicken tenders in a large skillet over medium heat; season with half the seasoning mixture. Cook chicken until halfway cooked, about 5 minutes. Flip and season the other sides with the remaining seasoning mixture; cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 5 more minutes. Remove cooked chicken from skillet. Mix tomatoes with green chile peppers, onion, asparagus, carrots, zucchini, mushrooms, bell peppers, and garlic in the same skillet; cook until vegetables are softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add chicken broth, lemon juice, lemon zest, and chicken tenders to the vegetable mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain and return noodles to pot. Add Parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese; toss until cheeses melt. Transfer noodles to 5 serving bowls; top each with 1 chicken tender and 1/5 the vegetable mixture.
