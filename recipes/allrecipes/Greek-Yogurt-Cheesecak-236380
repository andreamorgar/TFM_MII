Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spread almonds onto a baking sheet. Bake almonds in the preheated oven until roasted and fragrant, 10 to 15 minutes. Combine almonds, coconut oil, figs, and sea salt in a food processor; pulse until well combined. Press almond mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan; refrigerate until cooled, at least 30 minutes. Heat juice from 2 lemons and gelatin in the top of a double boiler over simmering water until gelatin is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Process yogurt, cream of coconut, 2/3 cup honey, vanilla extract, salt, and vanilla bean together in a food processor until well combined, about 1 minute. Drizzle gelatin mixture through the feeding tube of the food processor while it is still running and process until incorporated, about 30 seconds. Pour yogurt mixture over the cooled crust; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight. Heat blueberries, zest and juice from 1 lemon, 1 tablespoon honey, and arrowroot powder together in a small saucepan over medium heat until thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour mixture into a blender and blend until smooth. Pour topping over chilled cheesecake.
