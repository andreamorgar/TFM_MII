Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Set out 8 (4 inch) ramekins on a baking tray. In a large bowl, stir together the all-purpose flour, chick pea flour, 1 cup sugar, lemon zest, cardamom, nutmeg, baking soda, and salt. Combine the soy milk, water and lemon juice; stir into the dry ingredients until well blended. In a separate large bowl, stir together the egg substitute and 1/4 cup water. Whip with an electric mixer until foamy. Gradually mix in the sugar and fruit pectin while whipping until thick. Fold the egg substitute mixture into the batter, and fill ramekins about 3/4 full with the batter. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until set and golden.
