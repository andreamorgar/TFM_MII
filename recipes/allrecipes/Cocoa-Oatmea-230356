Stir 2 cups water, milk, and oats together in a large saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook oats at a simmer until softened and beginning to thicken, about 15 minutes. Stir 1 cup water, mashed banana, flax seed, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg through the oats; continue cooking at a simmer until thick, about 10 minutes. Fold walnuts into the oatmeal.
