Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Melt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, about 1 minute. Let cool. Combine sugar and egg in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and airy, about 3 minutes. Add melted chocolate, flour, milk, cocoa powder, sour cream, and vegetable oil; beat until batter is smooth and well blended. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
