Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan. Mix oats, sunflower seeds, wheat germ, sesame seeds, and salt in a large bowl. Set aside. Combine vanilla extract, peanut butter, and honey in a separate bowl until they are well mixed. Add peanut butter mixture to oat mixture and stir until dough begins to thicken and dry ingredients are incorporated. Add chopped fruit, walnuts, and chocolate chips. Continue to stir until the dough sticks together in big stiff lumps and is uniformly mixed. Pour dough into the prepared baking pan. Firmly press dough into the pan until it is compact and uniformly spread. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, about 20 minutes. Let cool completely before cutting and serving.
