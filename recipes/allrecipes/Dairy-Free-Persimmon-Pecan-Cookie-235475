Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Stir baking soda into the persimmon puree in a small bowl; set aside. Mix flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt together in a bowl. Beat margarine, honey, agave nectar, and applesauce together in a large bowl. Slowly beat the persimmon mixture into the margarine mixture. Gradually stir flour mixture into the persimmon mixture. Fold dates, pecans, and lemon zest into the mixture. Drop cookie dough by the spoonful onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, 15 to 17 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
