Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place pretzels on baking sheets. Unwrap candy kisses and place one in the center of each pretzel. Place in preheated oven 1 to 2 minutes, until kisses melt. Remove from oven and place one candy-coated chocolate in the center of each pretzel. Chill in refrigerator until set.
