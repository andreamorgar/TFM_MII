Preheat oven to 275 degrees F. Put corn bread cubes in baking dish. Whisk together milk, egg, molasses, ginger, and a pinch of salt and pour over bread. Let stand 5 minutes. Bake on a baking sheet in middle of oven until edge of custard is just set and center is still wobbly, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool pudding to warm (it will continue to set as it cools).
