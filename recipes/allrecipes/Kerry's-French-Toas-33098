In a medium bowl, blend the cream cheese with brown sugar, allspice, nutmeg and cinnamon Spread 4 slices bread with the cream cheese mixture, and top with remaining bread slices, creating sandwiches. Mix eggs and milk in a shallow bowl. Dip bread into the egg and milk to coat thoroughly. Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium high heat. Cook coated bread slices 2 to 4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.
