Spread a 1 inch layer of whipped topping into bottom of graham cracker crust. Cover whipped topping with a layer of cookies. Cover cookies with another layer of whipped topping. Continue to alternate layers until cookies and whipped topping are gone. Refrigerate for at least 24 hours to allow cookies to soften. Top with sprinkles just before serving.
