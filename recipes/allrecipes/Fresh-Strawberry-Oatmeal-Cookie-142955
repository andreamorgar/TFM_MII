Beat the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar in the large mixing bowl of an electric mixer at medium speed until fluffy. Add the egg, milk, and vanilla, and continue beating until smooth. Stir in the flour mixture, and mix well to blend. Combine the strawberries with the flour mixture, and stir to blend. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets.
