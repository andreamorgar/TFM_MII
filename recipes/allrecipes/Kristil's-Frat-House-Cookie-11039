Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Cream butter and sugars together until fluffy. Add eggs and blend well. Stir in salt, baking soda and flour. Blend until the flour is incorporated. Stir in the chocolate chips. Use a melon baler sized ice cream scoop to scoop out chunks of dough. Place onto greased or parchment lined cookie sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 12 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool cookies on a rack and place on a serving platter. Enjoy!
