Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine peaches, tapioca, almond extract, and 1/4 cup brown sugar in a bowl. Set mixture aside until tapioca pearls have softened, about 15 minutes. Whisk remaining 1/4 cup of brown sugar and flour in a separate bowl. Process rolled oats with walnuts in a food processor, pulsing a few times to grind to coarse crumbs; stir walnuts and oats into flour mixture. Drizzle topping mixture with melted butter and stir with a fork to create large crumbs of topping. Pour peaches and their juice into an 8x8-inch baking dish; spread crumb topping atop peaches in an even layer. Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and the peaches are bubbling, 35 to 40 minutes. Serve slightly warm.
