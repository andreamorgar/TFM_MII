Blend cream, coconut milk, blueberries, honey, and lemon extract together in a blender until smooth. Add shredded coconut and pulse 2 times. Pour mixture into a saucepan. Whisk egg yolks into cream mixture; bring to a boil. Immediately remove saucepan from heat and pour into a bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap so it touches the cream mixture. Refrigerate until completely chilled, at least 3 hours or overnight. Transfer cream mixture to an ice cream maker and process according to manufacturer's instructions until desired consistency is reached. Immediately scoop ice cream out of ice cream maker so it doesn't freeze to sides of bowl.
