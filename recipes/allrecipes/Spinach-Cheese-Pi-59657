Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch deep-dish pie plate. In a large bowl, stir together the spinach, ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs and bell pepper. Spread in the prepared pie dish so that it is a little thinner in the middle. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until the center is set, and the edges are lightly browned.
