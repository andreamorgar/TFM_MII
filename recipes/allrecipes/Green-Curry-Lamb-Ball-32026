In a medium bowl, mix together the ground lamb, bread crumbs and steak seasoning until well blended. Form into meatballs about 1 inch in diameter. Heat a greased skillet over medium-high heat and fry the lamb balls until they are a bit black and crusty, about 5 minutes. Remove balls from pan and set aside. Toss the curry paste into the hot skillet and fry for about a minutes. Then pour in the entire can of coconut milk and lower the heat. Let the mixture simmer, stirring frequently for 5 to 10 minutes. Serve the meatballs and curry sauce over rice.
