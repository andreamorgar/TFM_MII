Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange sweet potatoes in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Combine sugar, butter, bourbon and vanilla extract in a large saucepan and heat to a boil. As soon as the sauce comes to a boil pour it over the sweet potatoes. Bake 30 to 40 minutes or until the sweet potatoes are soft.
