Spread chocolate-hazelnut spread on 1 side of each slice of bread. Arrange banana slices over chocolate-hazelnut spread on 2 of the slices. Place remaining slices atop bananas to form 2 sandwiches. Whisk chocolate milk, eggs, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Dip sandwiches in milk mixture and turn as necessary to coat completely. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook sandwiches in hot butter until both sides are golden brown and banana and chocolate spread have softened, 4 to 6 minutes per side.
