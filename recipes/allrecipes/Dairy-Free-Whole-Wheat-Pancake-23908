Preheat griddle to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large mixing bowl combine dry ingredients. In another large mixing bowl combine eggs, oil and almond extract; whisk until combined. Stir in soy milk. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and whisk until combined. Batter should be slightly thick, adjust liquid if necessary. Pour batter by the 1/4 cup full onto hot griddle. Cook until edges look dry and bubbles burst. Flip and cook another minute or so until golden brown. Serve warm.
