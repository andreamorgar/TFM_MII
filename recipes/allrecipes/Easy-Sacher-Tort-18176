Bake cake in two 9 inch pans according to directions. Cool to room temperature. Place one layer of cake onto a serving plate, brush liberally with rum. Spread apricot jam over the top to 1/2 inch from the edge. Place the second layer on top. Brush with remaining rum. Frost the sides first, then the top with the prepared icing. Clean the edge of the plate with a dry towel.
