Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray or line with parchment paper. Combine spinach, onion, 5 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon olive oil, and eggs together in a large bowl. Add kale, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, sea salt, garlic powder, thyme, sage, rosemary, oregano, and black pepper; mix thoroughly using your hands. Form mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls and arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes; flip and continue baking until lightly browned, 10 to 20 more minutes.
