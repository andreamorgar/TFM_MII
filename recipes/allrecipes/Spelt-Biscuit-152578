Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C). In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually stir in milk until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. You may need to adjust the amount of milk. Pat out on a floured surface to about 1 inch thick. Cut into biscuits and place on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until the bottoms are golden brown.
