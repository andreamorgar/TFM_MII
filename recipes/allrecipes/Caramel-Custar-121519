In a saucepan over medium-low heat, bring cream almost to a simmer. Remove from the heat. In a mixing bowl, beat egg yolks, vanilla, sugar and salt until thick and lemon-colored, about 3 minutes. Gradually beat in cream. Pour into an ungreased 1-qt. baking dish. Place baking dish into a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Pour hot water into baking pan to a depth of 1 in. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-60 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Refrigerate until chilled. Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with enough brown sugar to cover the top. Broil 6-in. from the heat for 2 minutes or until sugar is melted. Serve immediately.
