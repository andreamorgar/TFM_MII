Fit one pastry circle into each tart tin. Spread one teaspoon of raspberry jam into the bottom of each tart shell. In a medium mixing bowl, cream together softened butter or margarine and white sugar until light and fluffy. Mix in egg. Add flour, baking powder, and almond extract and mix until all ingredients are thoroughly combined. Pour 1 tablespoon of batter into each tart shell. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, until risen and firm. Dust tarts with confectioners' sugar.
