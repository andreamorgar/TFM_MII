In a large bowl, cream together the butter or margarine and sugar. Add the eggs, beating well after each addition. In another bowl, sift together the flour and spices. Blend these dry ingredients into the sugar mixture. Dissolve the soda in the sour milk, and add to the batter. Grate the chocolate, and add to the batter. Pour batter into a greased and floured 8 inch round pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 minutes, or until done.
