Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (metal or glass pan). Grease (or lightly spray with cooking spray) bottoms only of two 9-inch round pans. Beat cake mix, water, oil and eggs in large bowl on low speed 1 minute, scraping bowl constantly (do not overbeat); or stir 2 minutes by hand. Pour into pans. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. (Decrease bake time by 2 to 3 minutes if using dark or nonstick pan.) Cool 10 minutes; remove from pans. Cool completely, about 1 hour. Cut 1 layer as shown in <a href="http://allrecipes.com/advice/special/mavericks/bceasterbunnycake.asp"> diagram </a>. Freeze cut pieces uncovered 1 hour for easier frosting. Place uncut layer on cake plate; frost top and side. Place cutout circle on larger layer; frost. Arrange head and feet on circle; frost. Cut marshmallow in half. Moisten 1 half and dip in red sugar; join to head with frosting for turkey's wattle. Use other half of marshmallow for turkey's eye. Use candy corn for beak, claws and feathers. Store loosely covered.
