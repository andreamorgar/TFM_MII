Place habanero pepper, tomato juice, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, cumin, and salt in a blender. Blend until smooth. Adjust level of spice by adding more habanero pepper, if desired. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours. Fill 2 old fashioned glasses with ice, pour 2 ounces of vodka in each glass, and top off with bloody mary mix.
