Place egg in a small saucepan, and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil, and immediately remove from heat. Cover, and let egg stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop. Heat oil in a skillet over low heat, and add chopped onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until brown and tender. Add chopped garlic, and saute for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the mixture from the skillet, and set aside to cool. In a blender or food processor, finely chop wheat crackers and walnuts. Mix in peas, seasoning salt and sauteed onion mixture. Add the egg, and blend to a fine paste, adding water or oil if necessary to attain desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.
