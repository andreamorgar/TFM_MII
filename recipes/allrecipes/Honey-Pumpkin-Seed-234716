Place oven rack in the highest position. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil. Mix butter, honey, brown sugar, and salt together in a bowl; add pumpkin seeds and toss to coat. Spread coated seeds in 1 layer onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Stir seeds and continue baking for 20 more minutes. Sprinkle seeds with white sugar and bake until lightly browned, about 20 more minutes. Cool seeds and store in an airtight container.
