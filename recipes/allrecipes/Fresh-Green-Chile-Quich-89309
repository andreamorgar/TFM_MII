Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook peppers and onion until tender. Transfer to a bowl and mix with feta, sour cream and salt. Spread bottom of pie crust with Monterey Jack cheese. Top cheese with pepper and onion mixture. Mix eggs and milk in a bowl; evenly pour over onion and pepper mixture. Top with Cheddar cheese. Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheese is melted and eggs are firm.
