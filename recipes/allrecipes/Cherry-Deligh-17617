Crumble cookies into a 9x9 inch pan and set aside. In a medium bowl, whip cream and set aside. In a separate mixing bowl, whip together cream cheese and confectioners' sugar until smooth and fluffy. Fold whipped cream into cream cheese mixture and spoon over crumbled cookies. Spread pie filling over top and refrigerate overnight.
