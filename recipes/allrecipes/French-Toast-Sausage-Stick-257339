Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Cook sausage according to package directions. In a bowl, combine the brown sugar and cinnamon; mix well. Add the eggs, milk and vanilla; whisk until combined. Using a rolling pin, roll out bread to flatten. Place one breakfast link on the edge of a bread slice; roll up jelly roll style. Dip in egg mixture to coat. Place on a greased baking sheet and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. Repeat for remaining sausage. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until crisp and lightly browned. Place cream cheese in a resealable plastic bag. Cut the corner off and pipe cream cheese onto the top of each French Toast Sausage Stick. Serve with maple syrup.
