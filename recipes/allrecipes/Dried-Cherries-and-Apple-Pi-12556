Combine cherries and apple slices in a large bowl. Stir together sugar, flour, and cinnamon; mix well with fruit. Let stand 15 minutes. Spread fruit mixture into pastry lined 9 inch pie pan. Dot with butter or margarine. Cover with top crust. Seal and flute the edges. Cut slits in the crust to allow steam to escape. Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 40 to 50 minutes, or until edge is golden brown and apples are tender.
