Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray an angel food tube pan or 2 5x9-inch bread pans with nonstick cooking spray. Sift the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, allspice, and salt together into a bowl. Stir the mincemeat pie filling, sugar, eggs, raisins, maraschino cherries, carrots, pecans, applesauce, canola oil, brandy flavoring, and vanilla extract together in a large mixing bowl. Mix about 1/3 of the flour mixture into the mincemeat mixture at a time, stirring 3 or 4 times after each addition. If the batter seems dry, stir in reserved maraschino juice, about 1 tablespoon at a time, until batter is desired consistency. Spoon the batter into prepared cake pan. Bake in the preheated oven until cake is lightly golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes.
