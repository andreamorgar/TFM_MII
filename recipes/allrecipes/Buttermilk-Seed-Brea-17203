In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Combine buttermilk, butter or margarine, honey and the yeast mixture in a large bowl. Add the salt, all of the seeds and the whole wheat flour. Stir to combine. Add the bread flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well with a wooden spoon after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 6 minutes. Lightly oil a large mixing bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with the oil. Cover with a damp cloth and put in a warm place to rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees F). Grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans. Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form into loaves. Place the loaves into the prepared pans. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 30 minutes or until the tops are brown and the bottom of a loaf sounds hollow when tapped.
