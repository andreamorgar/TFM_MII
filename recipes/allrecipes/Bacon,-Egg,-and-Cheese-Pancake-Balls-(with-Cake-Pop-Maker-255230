Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble into small pieces. Beat 3 eggs in a small bowl until smooth; pour into the hot skillet. Cook, stirring, over medium heat until scrambled and set, about 5 minutes. Preheat a cake pop maker according to manufacturer's instructions. Combine remaining egg, baking mix, milk, and vegetable oil in a large bowl to make pancake batter. Fold crumbled bacon, scrambled eggs, and Cheddar cheese gently into the batter. Fill wells of preheated cake pop machine with batter. Cook until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
