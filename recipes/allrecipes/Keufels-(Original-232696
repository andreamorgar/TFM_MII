Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups. Mix 1 cup and 2 tablespoons flour, margarine, and cream cheese in a bowl using a fork. Form dough into 24 small balls. Press and shape each ball to form a shell in the prepared muffin cups. Mix brown sugar, nuts, butter, egg, vanilla extract, and salt in a bowl. Spoon mixture into the prepared dough. Bake in the preheated oven until keufels are lightly browned and filling is bubbling, about 20 minutes.
