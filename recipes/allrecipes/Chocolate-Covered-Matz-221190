Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; spray with cooking spray. Arrange matzo to fit into pan; break boards if necessary. Combine butter and brown sugar together in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly until boiling; boil for about 3 minutes. Pour butter mixture evenly over matzo. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and immediately reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) if the matzo are smoking too much. Remove baking sheet from oven and sprinkle matzo with chocolate chips. Let stand to melt chocolate, 5 minutes. Spread the melted chocolate over matzo. Place in refrigerator until chilled and set. Break into pieces when cooled.
