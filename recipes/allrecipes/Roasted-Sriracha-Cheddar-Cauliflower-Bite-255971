Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray a 13x9-inch baking dish with non-stick cooking spray. Place the cauliflower in a large mixing bowl. Toss with the olive oil and garlic powder until thoroughly distributed. Transfer the cauliflower mixture to prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven 30 minutes. Top with shredded Cheddar cheese and bake until the cheese has melted, about 5 more minutes. Top cheesy florets with sriracha sauce to taste and garnish with green onions.
