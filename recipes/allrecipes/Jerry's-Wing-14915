In a large skillet or deep fryer, heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry wings for approximately 8 minutes. Let drain on paper towels. Place the chicken wings in a large mixing bowl. In a large saucepan, melt butter and hot sauce. Pour the sauce over the chicken wings and toss until all wings are coated.
