Combine avocados, tomatoes, black beans, corn, cilantro, red onion, oil, vinegar, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until salsa is well mixed. Spoon salsa into each tortilla and top with Monterey Jack cheese. Roll tortilla around filling to create a burrito. Warm burritos on a microwave-safe plate in the microwave until cheese is melted and salsa is warmed, about 45 seconds. Top burritos with sour cream.
