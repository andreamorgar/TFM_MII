Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x9 inch square pan. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Remove from heat and stir in the chocolate until smooth and well blended. Mix in the sugar and eggs then stir in the flour until just blended. Spread evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool before cutting into squares.
