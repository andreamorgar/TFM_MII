Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the flour until absorbed thoroughly by the butter. Add the onion and chives and saute for 5 minutes. Pour in the cream, water, milk, cumin, salt, ground black pepper, garlic powder, thyme, potatoes and chicken. Reduce heat to low and let simmer for 1 hour. Remove from heat, let cool slightly, pour into individual bowls and garnish each with parsley.
