Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift together flour, baking powder, cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Stir in the orange rind and nuts. In a medium size bowl, beat eggs and sugar until thick. Blend in flour mixture to make a smooth dough. Roll dough into 1 inch balls, place onto ungreased baking sheets and bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, until light brown.
