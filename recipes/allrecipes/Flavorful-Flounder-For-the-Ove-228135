Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare a 13x9-inch baking dish with non-stick cooking spray. Season both sides of flounder fillets with salt. Place into prepared baking dish. Brush 1 tablespoon lemon juice over fillets. Mix Parmesan cheese, melted butter, mayonnaise, green onions, and 2 tablespoons lemon juice in a bowl; spoon over the fillets. Bake flounder in preheated oven for 10 minutes. Switch oven to broil; broil fillets until the tops are just browned, 3 to 5 minutes.
