Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a 12 inch pizza pan or 9x13 inch baking dish. Unroll the crescent rolls and separate into triangles. Arrange in the pan with tips towards the center and lightly press together. Bake 5 minutes, or until lightly brown. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with pieces of Brie cheese. Spoon the cranberry sauce over the cheese. Top with pecans. Bake an additional 8 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the crust is golden brown. Cool 5 minutes and cut into wedges or squares.
