Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line several cookie sheets with Reynolds(R) Parchment Paper, set aside. Combine the granulated sugar, eggs, melted chocolate, shortening, baking powder and peppermint extract in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until combined. Gradually beat in as much of the flour as you can with the mixer. Using a wooden spoon, stir in any remaining flour. Cover and chill for 2 to 24 hours or until dough is easy to handle. Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Roll balls in powdered sugar and place 2 inches apart on prepared cookie sheets. Bake about 9 minutes or until edges are just set. Transfer the cookies on the parchment paper to a wire rack; cool completely.
