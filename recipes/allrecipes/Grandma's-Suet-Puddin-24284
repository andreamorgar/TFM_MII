Sour the milk by adding the lemon juice. In a large bowl combine suet, molasses, soured milk, baking soda, flour and raisins. Place batter in a pudding mold or large double boiler and steam, uncovered, for 2 hours. To make the sauce combine, in a small saucepan, the egg white, confectioner's sugar and vanilla. Heat over medium until thickened. Serve over warm pudding.
