Butter a baking sheet, and set aside. Melt margarine in 2 quart saucepan. Add sugar, and stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Stir in water and the corn syrup. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, to 270 degrees F (132 degrees C). Remove from heat, and quickly stir in coarse nuts. Spread on to prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle chocolate over hot candy; when it begins to melt, spread evenly over the top. Top with nuts. Refrigerate until firm. Break into small pieces to serve.
