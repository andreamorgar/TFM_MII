Put blueberries into a shallow bowl. Pour lemon juice and sprinkle sugar evenly over the blueberries; refrigerate at least 15 minutes. Divide pound cake cubes into 4 small dessert dishes. Pour milk into a bowl, add pudding mix, and beat with a whisk for 2 minutes; pour evenly over the 4 portions of pound cake. Refrigerate pudding and cake mixtures until the pudding is set, at least 5 minutes. Divide blueberries into 4 portions, reserving 4 berries for topping. Spoon 1 portion berries over each cake portion. Top each portion with whipped cream. Place one berry atop each portion of whipped cream.
