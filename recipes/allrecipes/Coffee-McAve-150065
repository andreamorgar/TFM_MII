Pour 2 jiggers of coffee flavored liqueur into a saucer. Spread sugar out on a separate saucer. Dip each glass into the liqueur and then into the sugar to coat the rim. Pour 1 jigger of rum into each glass. Light the rum on fire using a long match and allow it to burn the sugar around the rim of the glass until it has turned to caramel, about 1 minute. Extinguish the fire in each glass with a 1/2 cup sized scoop of ice cream. Pour 1 jigger of coffee liqueur over the ice cream, and top off the glass with hot coffee.
