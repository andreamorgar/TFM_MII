Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat eggs, mayonnaise, milk, flour, and 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning in a bowl until smooth and creamy; stir Cheddar cheese and parsley into egg mixture. Gently fold crabmeat into the filling. Pour crabmeat filling into the pie crust. Sprinkle a pinch of seafood seasoning over the quiche. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of the quiche comes out clean and the top is lightly browned, 40 to 45 minutes.
