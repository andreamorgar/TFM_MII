Bring a large pot of water to boil. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine flour, currants, raisins, suet, bread crumbs and sugar. Mix egg and milk with mixed spice, baking powder, salt and molasses. Stir into flour mixture to form a wet dough. Dip a heavy cotton cloth in boiling water and then sprinkle it with flour. Place dough in center of cloth, draw opposite corners together to form a ball, leaving a bit of room for the dumpling to expand, and tie tightly with twine to seal. Place the dumpling in the boiling water, reduce heat to a low boil, and cook 3 1/2 hours, topping water off as needed. Remove the dumpling from the water, remove the cloth and dry the dumpling in front of a fire or in a 150 degree oven until surface is no longer wet. Serve.
