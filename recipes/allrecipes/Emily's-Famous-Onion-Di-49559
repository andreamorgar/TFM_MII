Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Saute onions in butter until tender and lightly browned. Transfer onions to a serving bowl, and stir in yogurt and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Refrigerate for at least one hour before serving to blend flavors. This tastes even better if it sits overnight. The onion flavor gets stronger.
