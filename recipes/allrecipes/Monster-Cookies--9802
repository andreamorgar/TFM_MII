Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease cookie sheets. Cream butter and peanut butter together. Add the sugars and stir until well mixed. Add eggs one at a time, then add vanilla. Mix oatmeal and baking soda separately, then stir into batter. Add chocolate chips last. Drop by heaping teaspoons onto cookie sheets. Bake for 12-15 minutes.
