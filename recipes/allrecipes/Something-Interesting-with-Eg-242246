Whisk eggs and milk together in a bowl. Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir eggs until about halfway-cooked, 2 to 3 minutes. Add ham and onion to eggs; cook and stir until eggs are set and ham and onion are lightly browned, about 5 minutes more. Remove skillet from heat and stir sour cream into egg mixture. Layer bread cubes into 2 bowls; top with egg mixture, tomato, cucumber, and salt.
