Drain peaches, reserving 2/3 cup of syrup. Stir together pudding mix, milk, sour cream, and almond extract for 2 minutes, until very smooth. Pour filling into pie shell. Chill for 10 minutes. Arrange peach slices in a nice pattern over custard in pie shell. In a small saucepan, mix together reserved peach syrup and corn starch. Bring to a boil, and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in lemon juice. Pour glaze over peaches. Chill until set. Serve.
