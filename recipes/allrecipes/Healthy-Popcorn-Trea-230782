Heat coconut oil in a large pot over high heat. Drop 3 popcorn kernels into the hot oil and place a lid on the pot; cook until 1 kernel has popped. Remove the lid and pour in the remaining popcorn. Return the lid to the pot and cook popcorn, shaking pot back and forth over burner, until there are 1 to 2 seconds between pops, about 5 minutes. Quickly transfer popcorn to a large bowl; evenly drizzle honey over popcorn. Add salt and cinnamon; toss popcorn with your hands to coat evenly.
