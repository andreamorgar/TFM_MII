Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 3 round baking dishes with cooking spray. Mix flour, sour cream, and egg together with just enough water to bring the mixture together into a thick spreadable consistency. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot skillet until beef is completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Set beef mixture aside to cool. Divide the dough mixture into thirds. Stretch each portion to cover the bottom of a prepared baking dish. Spread about one-third of the ground beef mixture over each pastry dough. Top each with about 2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese. Cover each with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes.
