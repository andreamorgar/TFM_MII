Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone sheet liner. Grease the outsides of 12 2-inch diameter baking glasses or small bowls. Mash the butter and white sugar together in a bowl until smooth, and mix in the flour, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and the egg whites to make a smooth batter. Drop about 2 1/2 tablespoons of the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, and use a spoon or spatula to spread the dough out into a very thin circle about 7 inches in diameter. Repeat with the remaining batter. Bake in the preheated oven until the cookies are very lightly browned at the edges and the centers are set, 7 to 9 minutes. Watch them carefully so they don't overbake. Pull the sheet from the oven, and immediately slip a spatula underneath each flat cookie; center and drape them over the greased glasses to harden into small wavy bowls. Allow to cool completely. While the cookies cool over their molds, beat the cream cheese and confectioners' sugar in a bowl until smooth; mix in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Remove green tops and cores from 5 strawberries; place them into a small bowl, and mash to a juicy, slightly lumpy texture; mix the strawberries into the cream cheese mixture. Gently fold the whipped topping into the strawberry cream until thoroughly combined. Spoon about 3 tablespoons of the strawberry cream into each cookie bowl, then top with a pretty fresh strawberry with green top. Store leftover cookies in an airtight container, and leftover cream in refrigerator.
