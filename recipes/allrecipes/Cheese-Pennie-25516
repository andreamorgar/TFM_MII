In a medium bowl, knead together butter, all-purpose flour, Cheddar cheese and dry onion soup mix. Divide into two equal portions. Form each portion into a log shape. Wrap with wax paper. Chill at least 1 hour in the refrigerator, until firm. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut the log shapes into slices approximately 1/4 inch thick. Arrange slices in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Bake 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly browned.
