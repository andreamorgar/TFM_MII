Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C.) Arrange tart shells on a cookie sheet. In a large bowl, mix together brown sugar, butter, eggs, cream and vanilla. Stir in raisins and pecans. Divide filling into 24 (3 inch) tart shells. Bake in preheated oven for 16 to 20 minutes, or until filling is set.
