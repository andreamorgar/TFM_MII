Chill 4 glasses in the freezer for several hours until outsides of glasses are frosty. Meanwhile, prepare both frozen concentrate juices in separate pitchers, using only 1 1/2 cans of water to fill instead of 2. Refrigerate both juices. Before serving, fill each glass with crushed ice. Divide rum evenly between the glasses, then add passion fruit juice and lemonade in equal amounts. Finally, squeeze half of a lime into each glass to top. Stir. Garnish with fresh orange slices and cherries if desired.
