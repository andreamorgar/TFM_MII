Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place diced green tomatoes and vinegar in a large bowl. In a medium bowl, mix together sugar, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, salt and flour. Sprinkle over tomatoes and toss to coat evenly. Pour into pie crust and cover with criss-cross lattice crust. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 35 minutes, until bubbly and crust is brown.
