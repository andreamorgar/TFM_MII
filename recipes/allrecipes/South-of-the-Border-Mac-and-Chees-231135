Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Combine the rotini pasta, evaporated milk, American cheese, Cheddar cheese, canned green chiles, and chili powder in a slow cooker. Cook on High, stirring twice, for 2 hours. Stir tomatoes and green onions through the pasta mixture. Continue cooking until the tomatoes are hot, 5 to 10 minutes.
