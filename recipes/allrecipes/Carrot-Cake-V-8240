Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan, and line with wax paper. Combine water, sugar, raisins, grated carrots, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and butter in a medium saucepan. Cook over low heat for 5 minutes. Cool. In a large bowl, stir together flour, baking soda, nuts, and salt. Stir in carrot mixture. Pour into prepared pan. Bake for 1 1/4 hours, or until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool on wire racks.
