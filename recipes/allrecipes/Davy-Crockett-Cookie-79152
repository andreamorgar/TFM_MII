Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. In a large bowl, stir together the eggs, brown and white sugars, and vanilla. Add the oil and mix to combine. In a separate bowl, combine the flour and the oats. Gradually, stir flour mixture into egg mixture 1/2 cup at a time, stirring until completely mixed. Fold in chocolate chips. Spread the mixture evenly onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 13 minutes. Remove from oven still slightly gooey, and let cool for 3 minutes before cutting into squares. Then cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Store in an air-tight container.
