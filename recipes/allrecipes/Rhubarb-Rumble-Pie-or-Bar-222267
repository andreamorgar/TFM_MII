Combine rhubarb and strawberry gelatin mix in a large microwave-safe glass bowl. Cover bowl and cook rhubarb mixture on high until rhubarb is very soft and has cooked down into threads, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir every 2 minutes. Let mixture cool. Stir skim milk and vanilla pudding mix in a bowl until moistened. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed until thickened, about 2 minutes; stir cooled rhubarb mixture into pudding mixture. Spread strawberry slices into the bottom of prepared graham cracker crust. Spoon rhubarb pudding mixture over strawberries and refrigerate dessert until firm, about 1 hour.
