Heat ghee in a saucepan over medium heat. Add vermicelli; cook and stir until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour evaporated milk and water over vermicelli; bring to a boil. Stir sweetened condensed milk and cinnamon into vermicelli mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until vermicelli is cooked and milk is thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir raisins into vermicelli mixture; cook until raisins are plump and mixture is thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Serve garnished with almonds.
