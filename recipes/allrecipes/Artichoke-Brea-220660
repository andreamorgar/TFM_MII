Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine artichoke hearts, Parmesan cheese, mayonnaise, and garlic together in a bowl. Spread artichoke topping evenly over the French bread halves. Place coated bread on a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until topping is hot and bubbling, about 20 minutes.
