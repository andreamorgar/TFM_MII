Combine 3/4 cup sugar, cornstarch, water, lemon peel and juice, and egg yolks in a saucepan. Beat well. Stir while cooking over medium heat until thick; it will thicken just as it starts to simmer. Remove saucepan from heat. Add cream cheese to lemon mixture, and stir until incorporated. In a small bowl, beat egg whites until stiff; add remaining 1/4 cup sugar. Fold sweetened egg whites into lemon mixture. Spoon filling into shell and chill.
