Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 18 to 20 minutes. Add green beans to the boiling water; blanch for just 1 minute. Drain potatoes and green beans; transfer to bowl of iced water to stop cooking process, about 5 minutes. Remove from iced water with a slotted spoon and place on prepared baking sheet to dry. Cut potatoes into quarters. Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain and cool bacon slices on paper towels; crumble. Whisk vinegar, olive oil, mayonnaise, and mustard together in a large bowl. Season with salt and black pepper. Add potatoes and green beans; stir to coat. Top with bacon, blue cheese, and green onions; stir once to incorporate.
