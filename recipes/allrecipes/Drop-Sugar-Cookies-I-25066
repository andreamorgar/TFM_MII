Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. In a large bowl, cream together butter, shortening and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs a few at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the creamed mixture alternately with the sour milk. Use a size 16 cookie scoop or 1/4 cup measure to scoop out cookies onto the prepared cookie sheets. Cookies should be spaced at least 3 inches apart. Test a couple in the oven to see how much they spread, then see if they need to be flattened before the bake. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bottoms begin to turn golden. Let cool on baking sheets.
