Heat raspberries and sugar in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring, until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Press raspberry mixture through a strainer into a bowl; discard seeds. Stir milk, lemon juice, and cinnamon into raspberry mixture; refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour. Freeze milk mixture in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions.
