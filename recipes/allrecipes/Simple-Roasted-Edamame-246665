Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Toss edamame, olive oil, garlic, sea salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl until well-coated. Spread in a single layer on a baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven, stirring halfway through, until edamame shells start to brown, about 20 minutes. Serve whole, popping beans out of the shell to eat.
