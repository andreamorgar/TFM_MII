Toast bread. Heat butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Pour in egg and milk, and stir in black pepper. Stirring constantly, cook eggs until light and fluffy. Remove from heat and stir in salmon. Slice toast into triangles and place, with points in toward the middle, around a plate. Spoon eggs into the center and serve warm.
