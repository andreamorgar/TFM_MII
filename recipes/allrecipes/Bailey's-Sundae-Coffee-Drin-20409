Brew 12 cups of coffee. While the coffee is brewing, fill each cup with a scoop of ice cream. Be sure to use large cups (the oversized types you get at coffee houses are best). Top each scoop of ice cream with just enough Irish cream so that the ice cream looks lightly coated. When the coffee is brewed, pour it so that each cup is filled up about halfway. It is then up to each individual to add more Irish cream, half-and-half, or sugar to suit his/her taste.
