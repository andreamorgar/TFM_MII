Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix 1 1/2 cups flour, vegetable oil, milk, 2 teaspoons sugar, and salt in a bowl until mixture pulls together; transfer and press into a 9-inch pie dish to form a crust. Combine 1/4 cup sugar and cinnamon in a large bowl; toss apples into cinnamon sugar to coat. Transfer apples to pie dish. Stir 1 cup flour and brown sugar in a bowl. Cut in cold butter with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle crumbs over apples. Bake in preheated oven until golden and bubbly, about 45 minutes.
