Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add onions and cook until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook 1 more minute. Add Italian sausage and mushrooms; cook until meat is browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Drain. Place drained sausage mixture in a large mixing bowl along with tomato paste, tomato sauce, crushed red peppers, oregano, rosemary, black pepper, and thyme. Mix until well combined. Fill each pepper half with mixture and place on prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until cooked through, about 30 minutes.
