Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir cookie crumbs and margarine in a bowl until evenly moistened; press into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly darkened, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven and cool to room temperature; about 30 minutes. Stir gelatin and cold water in a small saucepan over low heat until gelatin dissolves completely, about 3 minutes. Beat cream cheese and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Gradually add gelatin mixture, milk, and peppermint candy; mix until well-blended. Chill filling until thickened, about 2 hours. Fold whipped cream and chocolate into filling. Pour filling into crust; chill until firm, about 1 hour.
