Whisk almond milk, pumpkin puree, vanilla extract, sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice, and pepper together in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is almost boiling; remove from heat and whisk until frothy, about 1 minute. Divide mixture between 2 mugs. Slowly pour coffee into each mug. Top with whipped cream and pinch pumpkin pie spice.
