Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet with cooking spray. Sift flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and baking soda into a bowl. Mix vegetable oil, sugar, and soy yogurt together in a bowl. Stir in flour mixture until dough comes together. Drop tablespoons of dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 7 minutes.
