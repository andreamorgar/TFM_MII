Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. In a separate bowl, cream the shortening and brown sugar. Mix in the egg, orange juice and zest until well blended. Gradually add the dry ingredients, stirring constantly. Stir in the butterscotch chips and coconut. Pour the dough into greased baking pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until top is golden brown. Let cool before cutting into squares.
