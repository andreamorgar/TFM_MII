Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease two 8 1/2x4 1/2-inch loaf pans. Place yellow cake mix, eggs, warm water, vegetable oil, poppy seeds, and butterscotch pudding mix into a mixing bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until batter is smooth, about 2 minutes. If beating by hand, beat for 5 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pans. Bake in preheated oven until cakes are lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Tip pans on their sides until cakes are cool, about 30 minutes. Invert pans to remove the loaves.
