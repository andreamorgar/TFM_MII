Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch cake pans or line them with parchment paper. Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, sugar, salt, cocoa powder, 3/4 cup water, and vegetable oil in a mixing bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes. Add the eggs, vanilla extract, and 1/2 cup water and beat for another 2 minutes. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven until the surface of the cake springs back when lightly pressed and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
