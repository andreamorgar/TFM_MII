Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine the mayonnaise, crushed garlic, parmesan cheese, artichoke hearts and Worcestershire sauce. Pour into a baking dish and top with cayenne pepper and parsley flakes. Bake in the preheated oven, approximately 30 to 45 minutes, until hot and bubbly. Serve with tortilla chips, crackers or veggies.
