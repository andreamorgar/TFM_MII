Arrange cake slices on bottom of a rectangular 11x7 inch baking dish, cutting cake slices if necessary to fit the bottom of the dish. Drizzle coffee over cake. Beat cream cheese, sugar, and chocolate syrup, in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Add heavy cream; beat on medium speed until light and fluffy. Spread over cake. Sprinkle with chocolate-covered toffee candy. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, but no longer than 24 hours, to set dessert and blend flavors.
