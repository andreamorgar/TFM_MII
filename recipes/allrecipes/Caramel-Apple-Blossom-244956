Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray. Combine apple and cinnamon sugar in a bowl; mix until evenly coated. Divide crescent roll dough into 8 triangles. Spoon about 1 teaspoon apple mixture onto each triangle and top with 1/2 teaspoon caramel sauce. Roll crescent dough around the filling, bringing the ends together and squeezing to completely contain the filling. Sprinkle a little more cinnamon sugar on top of each crescent roll. Place rolls on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until crescent rolls are lightly browned, 11 to 13 minutes.
