Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place sausage in a skillet over medium heat, and cook until evenly brown. Drain grease. In a bowl, mix the sausage, cream cheese, and Parmesan cheese. Spoon about 1 tablespoon sausage mixture into each jalapeno half. Arrange stuffed halves in baking dishes. Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly and lightly browned. Serve with Ranch dressing.
