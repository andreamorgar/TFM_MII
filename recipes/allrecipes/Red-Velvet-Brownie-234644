Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking dish. Whisk flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, ground red pepper, and salt together in a bowl. Beat sugar, sour cream, butter, eggs, red food coloring, and vanilla together in a bowl. Add flour mixture to sour cream mixture and stir to combine. Pour batter into prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with fudgy crumbs, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pan before slicing.
