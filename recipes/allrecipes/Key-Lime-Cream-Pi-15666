Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium mixing bowl, combine eggs, condensed milk, lime juice, and lime rind. Beat on medium speed with electric mixer for about 1 minute or until mixture is thoroughly blended. Pour into baked pastry shell. Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, until center is set. Cool on a rack for 15 minutes, then chill at least 2 hours before serving. Garnish with whipped cream if desired. Immediately refrigerate any leftovers. Do not store for longer than 3 days.
