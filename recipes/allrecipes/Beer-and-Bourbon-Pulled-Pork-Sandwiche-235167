Heat about 2 tablespoons canola oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Fry pork chops in batches until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer browned pork chops to a slow cooker. Wipe skillet clean and heat remaining 1 1/2 teaspoon canola oil and butter over medium heat; cook and stir onions, 1/2 bottle beer, and a pinch of salt until onion is tender and slightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add liquid smoke. Spread onions over pork. Mix barbeque sauce, remaining beer, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, bourbon, and hot sauce in a bowl; pour over pork. Cook pork on Low until very tender, about 8 hours. Shred and divide pork over rolls to make sandwiches.
