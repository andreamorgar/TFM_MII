Scrub oysters well. Combine oysters and apple cider in a 2-qt. saucepan and bring to a boil. Steam oysters, covered, over moderately high heat until they just open, checking occasionally after 3 minutes and transferring to a plate as they open. (Reserve steaming liquid and discard any unopened oysters.) Chill oysters, loosely covered, until cool, about 30 minutes. While oysters are chilling, pour oyster steaming liquid through a paper towel-lined sieve into a bowl to remove any grit. Stir 2 tablespoons strained liquid together with remaining ingredients and salt to taste. Discard remaining strained liquid. Remove flat half of oyster shell and loosen oyster with a sharp knife. Put oysters in rounded half of shell. Arrange on plates and spoon sauce over oysters.
