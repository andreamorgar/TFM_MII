Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Crush the corn flakes (should yield about 1 1/4 cups). Cream the butter or margarine with the shortening. Add the eggs and the sugar and beat until fluffy. Stir in the flour, cinnamon and baking soda, mixing well. Stir in the corn flakes. Drop by spoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets and bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for about 9 minutes or until light brown. Let stand for 1 minute then cool on wire racks.
