Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix sugar, vegetable oil, eggs, salt, cinnamon, buttermilk, flour, baking powder, and blueberries, stirring after each addition, in a large bowl. Pour batter into prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes.
