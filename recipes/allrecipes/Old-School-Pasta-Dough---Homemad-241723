Mix flour, eggs, egg yolks, olive oil, and salt together in a bowl until dough reaches a crumbly texture. Knead dough until smooth and even. Add 1 tablespoon flour to dough until dough is smooth and soft, if needed. Wrap dough with a clean cloth or plastic wrap, place in a bowl, and let rest for 20 to 30 minutes. Roll dough into golfball-size balls and roll to about 1/4-inch thickness using a pasta machine or roller.
