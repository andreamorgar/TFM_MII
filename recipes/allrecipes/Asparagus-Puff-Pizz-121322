Place asparagus in a steamer basket over 1 in of boiling water in a saucepan; cover and steam until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Drain on paper towel. Place crust on an ungreased 12-in. pizza pan; arrange asparagus on top. In a bowl, combine the mayonnaise, cheese and mustard; mix well. In a small mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold into mayonnaise mixture; spread over asparagus. Bake at 450 degrees F for 12-13 minutes or until golden brown. Cut into wedges; serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.
