In a jar, combine lime juice, sugar, lime zest, rice vinegar, and mustard. Shake well, and set aside. In a small bowl, mix chicken with limeade concentrate and pepper. Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Cook and stir chicken 4 to 6 minutes, or until no longer pink, and juices run clear. Divide lettuce onto 4 salad plates. Top with mandarin orange segments, golden raisins, and walnuts. Place cooked chicken on top, and drizzle lightly with dressing.
