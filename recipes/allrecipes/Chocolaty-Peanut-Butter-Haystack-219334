Place the chocolate chips into a microwave-safe bowl and cook on High for 30 seconds; stir and repeat several times, just until the chips are melted. Add peanut butter, cook for 20 more seconds to warm the peanut butter, and mix thoroughly. Mix in the toffee bits and chow mein noodles; stir to coat the ingredients with the chocolate mixture. Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper; drop the mixture onto the lined sheets by the tablespoon. Refrigerate until set.
