Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and return pasta to pot. Mix butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper into pasta until evenly combined.
