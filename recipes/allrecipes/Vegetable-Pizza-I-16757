Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Roll out crescent rolls onto large non-stick baking sheet. Stretch and flatten to form rectangular shape on sheet. Bake 12 minutes, or until golden brown. Allow to cool. In medium size mixing bowl, mix ranch dressing mix, mayonnaise, sour cream, and cream cheese until well blended. Spread the mixture over the cooled crust. Arrange vegetables over the top of the crust. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
