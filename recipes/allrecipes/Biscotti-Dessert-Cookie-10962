Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine flour, hazelnuts, and baking powder. In a large bowl, beat butter and honey until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients. Divide dough in half. On prepared baking sheet, form each half into a log about 12 inches long and 2 inches wide, spacing about 2 inches apart. Bake for 14 to 16 minutes until golden brown. Transfer logs to a cutting board and cut on diagonal into 1/2 inch thick slices. Lay slices on ungreased baking sheet and bake for 10 to 12 minutes longer -- until dry. Transfer to wire racks to cool. Store in a tightly sealed container and let them age for a few days before serving.
