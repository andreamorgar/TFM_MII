Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Mix peanut butter, 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons honey, eggs, coconut flour, vanilla extract, and baking soda together in a large bowl until cookie dough is well-combined. Drop teaspoonfuls of cookie dough onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 15 minutes. Use a fork to press a crisscross pattern into cookies immediately after removing from the oven.
