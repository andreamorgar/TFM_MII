Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease baking sheets. In a bowl, sift the flour, baking soda, and salt together. In a separate large bowl, cream the butter, 1 cup of white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth, and beat in the eggs and vanilla extract until well combined. Stir in the flour mixture, and mix the pecans into the dough. Drop the dough by tablespoons onto the prepared baking sheets, about 2 inches apart. Place 1/2 cup of white sugar into a shallow bowl. Moisten the bottom of a drinking glass with a wet cloth, and dip the glass bottom into the sugar. Flatten cookies with the sugared glass, dipping into sugar for each cookie. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 9 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool on sheets for a minute or two before removing to finish cooling on racks.
