Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk eggs, sour cream, milk, butter, flour, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until thoroughly combined; gently stir imitation crabmeat and Swiss cheese into the egg mixture. Spread the filling into the pie crust. Bake quiche in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the filling comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.
