Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a mixing bowl, combine the baking mix, cheese, and water. Mix until dough is firm. Using a small scoop, place dough on the prepared pan. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown. Combine the melted butter, garlic powder, salt, onion powder and parsley. Brush over baked biscuits immediately upon removing from oven.
