Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 2 9x5-inch loaf pans with cooking spray. Mix cake mix, pecans, bananas, water, vegetable oil, pudding mix, and eggs together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until evenly blended. Pour half the batter into each of the prepared loaf pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle of each loaf comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
