Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Mix mild sausage and hot sausage in a large bowl until evenly blended. Stir Cheddar cheese into sausage mixture. Mix biscuit baking mix into sausage mixture about 1/2 cup at a time until baking mix is moist. Roll meat mixture into 1 1/4- to 1 1/2-inch balls. Arrange meatballs on prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are no longer pink in the center and cheese is browned, about 20 minutes.
