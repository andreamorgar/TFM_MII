Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a large bowl, stir together the molasses, brown sugar, vinegar, and egg. Sift together the flour, baking soda, ginger and salt; add to molasses mixture. Mix until well blended. Spoon the dough by teaspoonfuls onto cookie sheets, about 2 inches apart. Bake until edges are golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool on pans for 5 minutes before removing.
