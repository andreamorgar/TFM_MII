Stir together ricotta cheese, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla and almond extracts in a bowl until smooth. Mix graham cracker crumbs and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Spoon about 1/4 of the graham cracker mixture into 2 wine glasses. Layer about 1/4 the cheese mixture on top, then repeat the layers with the remaining cracker crumbs and ricotta cheese. Top with chopped peaches and grated chocolate. Chill until ready to serve.
