Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk flour and salt together in a bowl; form a well in the center. Add milk and oil; mix until smooth dough forms. Turn dough out onto a lightly-floured work surface; knead until smooth and pliable, 10 to 15 minutes. Set dough aside to rest for 15 minutes. Divide dough into 4 equal pieces; roll out each piece with a rolling pin to 1/4-inch thickness. Arrange on prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes.
