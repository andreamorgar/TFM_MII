Stir 2 quarts water and salt in a large pot until salt is dissolved. Submerge cucumbers in the water. Add ice to the water to keep cold. Let cucumbers soak for 2 hours. Drain salt water from pot. Rinse and drain cucumber slices twice. Stir sugar, 4 cups water, apple cider vinegar, turmeric, mustard seed, and celery seed together in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; add cucumber slices. Simmer until the cucumbers are completely hot, but do not bring to a boil, about 10 minutes. Sterilize canning jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the cucumbers into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Let cucumbers pickle 2 weeks before eating, shaking each jar once daily.
