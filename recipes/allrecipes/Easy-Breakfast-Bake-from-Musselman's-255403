Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly spray a 3-quart casserole dish (or a 13x9-inch pan) with nonstick cooking spray. Brown the sausage in a skillet and crumble it as it cooks. Remove to a paper towel to drain any excess grease. Roll up the crescent rolls according to your package instructions and line them up in the casserole dish (it is okay if they touch). Whisk together the eggs, milk, apple butter and optional cheese. Scatter the cooked sausage over the top of the crescent rolls in the dish. Pour the egg mixture over the top. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until the eggs have completely set in the center.
