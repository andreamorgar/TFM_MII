Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 4 9x5 inch loaf pans. In a large saucepan, combine beer, sugar and butter over medium-low heat. When the ingredients melt into each other remove from the stove top and let cool. When the mixture is cool, mix in beaten eggs and vanilla extract. In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, raisins and mixed fruits. Stir beer mixture slowly into the dry mixture, incorporating and mixing as you go. Pour mixture into the prepared loaf pans. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 90 minutes.
