Heat a lightly greased griddle or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Mash potatoes with flour, butter, and salt until a stiff dough forms. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead dough lightly and roll dough out to about 1/2-inch thick. Cut into six triangular wedges. Working in batches, cook scones, turning once on hot griddle until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per side.
