In a bowl, combine the cream cheese, sour cream, and mayonnaise until well-blended. Spread into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Scatter the shrimp generously over the top of the mixture. In another bowl, stir together the cocktail sauce, green pepper, green onions, garlic, and tomato. Working in layers, spread a portion of the cocktail sauce mixture over the shrimp. Sprinkle with a portion of mozzarella cheese. Repeat process until all ingredients are used up, finishing with a layer of mozzarella cheese on top. Serve with assorted crackers for dipping.
