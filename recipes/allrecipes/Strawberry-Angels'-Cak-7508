Bake cake for filling according to package directions. Let cool. Slice angel food cake in half horizontally. Creat a tunnel for the filling by removing a small amount of the interior of the bottom half of the cake. In a bowl combine cream, confectioners' sugar and cocoa; whip until soft peaks form. Fold half the strawberries into half the whipped cream; spoon into cake tunnel, pressing down firmly. Replace top of cake; pressing gently. Frost cake with remaining cream mixture. Cover top of cake with remaining strawberries. Chill about 15 minutes before slicing. Serves 10-12 people.
