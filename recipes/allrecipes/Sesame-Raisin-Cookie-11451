Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring 3/4 cup of water to boil and add the raisins. When the water returns to a boil turn off the heat. Let the raisins plump for at least 10 minutes. Drain the raisins well, then chop them coarsely. Toast the sesame seeds by stirring them with a wooden spoon in a heavy saute pan over medium heat. Saute until the seeds begin to crackle, pop and smell toasted; about 10 minutes. Combine rice flour, oats, salt and toasted sesame seeds. Stir apple juice, oil and vanilla into the flour mixture. Form the dough into 8 large balls. Place each ball on greased cookie sheets or parchment paper. Moisten your fingers and flatten each ball until it is 1/2 inch thick. Bake 25 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool on pans before removing.
