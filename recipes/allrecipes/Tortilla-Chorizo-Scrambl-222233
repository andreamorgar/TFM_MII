Beat eggs in a small bowl. Set aside. Combine tortilla slices and chorizo in a skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until tortillas are crisped, 5 minutes. Place cheese slices on top of chorizo and tortillas; pour in eggs. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring, until eggs are cooked through, 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste; garnish with chives.
