Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place asparagus on a baking sheet; drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake the asparagus in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. While asparagus is baking, spread the pizza sauce over the pizza crust. Distribute asparagus pieces and crumbles of blue cheese evenly over the pizza. Return pizza to center rack of preheated oven; bake until the cheese is melted and bubbling, 8 to 10 more minutes.
