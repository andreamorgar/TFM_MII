Place the lime peel, soy sauce, and chicken broth in a skillet over medium heat. Place the chicken breasts in the skillet, and bring to a boil. Cover, and simmer until the chicken is fully cooked. Remove from heat, and allow to cool. Shred chicken, and set aside. In a separate bowl, whisk together lime juice, olive oil, anchovy paste, sugar, salt, and pepper. Stir in garlic, cilantro, shallots, and chicken. Mix well.
