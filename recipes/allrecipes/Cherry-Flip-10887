Blend together the butter, egg yolks, vanilla, salt, confectioners' sugar and flour. Take small amount of dough in hand , flatted out and wrap around drained cherry. ( I use a combination of red and green cherries and tint the icing to match the color of the cherry. ) Bake on ungreased cookie sheet at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until golden brown (about 10 minutes). Cool and dip in tinted butter icing. Roll in coconut flakes. ENJOY!
