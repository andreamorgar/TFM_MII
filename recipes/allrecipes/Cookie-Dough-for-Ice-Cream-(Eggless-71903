In a medium bowl, mix together the brown sugar, white sugar, and butter until smooth. Stir in vanilla and water. Mix in the flour until well blended. Shape into a loaf or log, and freeze for 1 to 2 hours. Cut into small chunks, and mix into softened ice cream. Freeze for 15 minutes or until firm before serving.
