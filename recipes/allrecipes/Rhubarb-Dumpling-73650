Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Separate the biscuits in the can. Flatten each one into about a 3 inch circle. Place a generous tablespoon of chopped rhubarb in the center of each circle. Wrap the dough up around the rhubarb, and pinch to seal tightly. Place the dumplings seam side down in a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a medium bowl, or large measuring cup, stir together the sugar, water, butter and vanilla. Pour over the dumplings in the pan. Sprinkle cinnamon over the top. Bake uncovered for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until biscuits are golden brown.
