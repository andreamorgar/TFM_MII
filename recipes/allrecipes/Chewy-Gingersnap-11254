Cream the butter for 2 minutes at medium speed. Add 2 1/2 cups of the flour plus the sugar, molasses, egg, lemon extract, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, baking soda and salt. Mix well on medium-high speed. Stir in the remaining flour until blended. Cover and refrigerate dough for at least 2 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove dough from refrigerator, and with a teaspoon, scoop out rounded measures of dough. Roll dough into balls and place 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Flatten slightly with the bottom of a glass dipped in white sugar. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 11 minutes. Let stand for approximately for 30 seconds on cookie sheet before removing to cooling racks. Cool completely and store in airtight containers.
