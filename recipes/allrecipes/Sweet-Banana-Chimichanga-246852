Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add bananas and sugar; cook and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Stir in whiskey. Add honey; simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors are combined, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Heat tortillas one at a time in a microwave until pliable, about 8 seconds. Spoon some of the banana mixture onto the bottom third of a tortilla. Fold in opposing edges and roll tortilla up tightly like a burrito, securing ends with toothpicks. Repeat with remaining mixture and tortillas. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry tortillas until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.
