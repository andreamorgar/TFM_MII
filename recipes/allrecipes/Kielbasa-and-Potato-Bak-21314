Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large mixing bowl, mix together soup, milk, garlic, salt, and pepper. Stir in potatoes and kielbasa. Spoon into a 7x11 inch casserole dish. Place casserole on a baking sheet, and bake in the preheated oven for 90 minutes, or until potatoes are tender.
