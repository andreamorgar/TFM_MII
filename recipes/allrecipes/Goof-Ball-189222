Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Pour the crispy rice cereal into a large bowl. Combine the margarine, sweetened condensed milk, and caramels in the top of a double boiler. Stirring constantly, cook over lightly simmering water until melted and combined, about 5 minutes. Use a wooden skewer to dip each marshmallow in the hot caramel mixture. Immediately roll caramel coated marshmallow in the crispy rice cereal. Remove from skewer and place on the waxed paper to harden.
