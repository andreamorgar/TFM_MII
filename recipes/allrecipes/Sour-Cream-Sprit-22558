Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cream together butter and sugar. Beat in egg yolk, sour cream and vanilla. In a separate bowl, mix flour, cinnamon, salt and baking soda. Stir flour mixture into butter mixture. Place dough into a cookie press and press cookies onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven 10 to 12 minutes, until golden. Cool 5 minutes on sheet before moving to wire rack to cool completely.
