Place a large piece of waxed paper on a work surface; arrange pretzels on waxed paper. Place three tiny dots of marshmallow creme next to each other in a few areas on each pretzel rod; top each dot with a mini chocolate chip. These will be your 'picnic ants'. Place more dots of the marshmallow creme around the 'ants' and cover them with white chocolate chips. It should look like little ants going for pieces of food at a picnic. Allow the candies rest on the marshmallow creme for a few minutes before eating.
