Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and stir in mushrooms and garlic; sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Cook and stir until the mushrooms have given off their juice and the juice has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set mushroom mixture aside. Heat 1 more tablespoon olive oil in a separate large skillet over medium-high heat until very hot, and place asparagus into the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until asparagus pieces are very well browned (almost but not quite burned in spots), about 8 minutes. Remove asparagus from skillet and set aside. Reduce heat to medium, and cook bacon in the same skillet until crisp, about 10 minutes; stir often. Drain excess grease as the bacon cooks, for crisper pieces. Remove bacon pieces and place on a paper towel-lined plate; blot with paper towels to reduce grease. Place the flatbread crust onto the prepared baking sheet, and spread marinara sauce over the crust. Spread the mushrooms and garlic evenly over the pizza. Spread asparagus over the pizza. Arrange bacon pieces on the pizza. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese all over the pizza, followed by Asiago cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until the cheeses are melted and bubbling, 12 to 15 minutes.
