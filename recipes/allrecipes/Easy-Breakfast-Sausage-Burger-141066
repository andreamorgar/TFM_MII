Form the bulk hot pork sausage into 5 patties. Heat a large skillet, and fry the patties over medium high heat. Remove the sausage from the skillet and drain on paper towels. Melt butter in a second large skillet, and toast the buns over medium heat until golden brown. Meanwhile, break the eggs into the same skillet used for frying the sausage; reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook until the white is completely set and the yolk thickens. Flip the eggs and continue cooking for another 30 seconds, or until the yolk is to the diners' preferences. Stack your toasted buns starting with the pickles and jalapeno slices on the bottom, then the cooked sausage patty, pepperjack cheese, fried egg, and onion. Cover with the top half of the bun. Enjoy as the cheese melts between the egg and the sausage.
