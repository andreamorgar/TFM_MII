In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar. Add corn syrup, egg and honey; mix well. Sift together the flour, salt, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, and baking soda; stir into the sugar mixture alternately with the buttermilk. Knead dough, which should be very stiff, by hand for 15 to 30 minutes. Divide dough into 2 pieces, flatten slightly, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate 3 hours or overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F ( 175 degrees C ). Roll out dough to 1/4 inch thickness and cut into 1 inch squares. Place on an unprepared cookie sheet and bake for 15 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until dry inside.
