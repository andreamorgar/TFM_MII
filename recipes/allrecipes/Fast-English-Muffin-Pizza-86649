Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place the English muffin halves cut side up onto a baking sheet. Spoon some of the pizza sauce onto each one. Top with mozzarella cheese and pepperoni slices. Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the cheese is melted and browned on the edges.
