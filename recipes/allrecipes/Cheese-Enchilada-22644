Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl combine tomato sauce, tomato paste and Creole-style seasoning. Warm tortillas in microwave, or in oven; dip them in the tomato sauce mixture and lay them in a 9x13 inch casserole dish. Fill each tortilla with cheese, onion, olives and mushrooms; roll. Repeat until dish is full. Sprinkle a small amount of cheese on top. Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
