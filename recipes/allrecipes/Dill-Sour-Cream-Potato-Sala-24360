Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and cool. In a large bowl combine potatoes, celery and green onions. In a small bowl combine vinegar, oil, salt, pepper and dill weed. Pour over potatoes and toss gently. Refrigerate for several hours, or overnight. Stir in sour cream, and pickles just before serving. Garnish with tomato wedges.
