Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x11 inch baking dish. Toss together the pieces of bread and mango, and place in the prepared baking dish. In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, eggs, milk, vanilla and cardamom. Pour over the bread. Dot with small pieces of butter. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes in the preheated oven, or until slightly puffed and golden brown.
