In a 3 quart pot over high heat, combine the potatoes with enough water to cover. Boil for one hour, adding water to cover potatoes as necessary. Add the celery, leeks and scallions and boil for another hour. Reduce heat to low, add the corn and parsley and heat through. Add the non-dairy creamer just before serving. Enjoy!
