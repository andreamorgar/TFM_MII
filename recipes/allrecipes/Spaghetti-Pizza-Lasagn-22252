Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook beef until brown; drain. Beat milk and eggs together until well combined; season with salt and pepper. Place pasta in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour milk mixture evenly over pasta. Pour pasta sauce over that. Distribute beef evenly over pasta sauce and sprinkle with oregano, garlic powder, minced onion and pepperoni slices. Top with shredded cheese. Bake in preheated oven until hot and bubbly, 30 minutes.
