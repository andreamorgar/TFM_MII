Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, beat together the butter, vegetable oil, white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth and creamy. Then add egg, vanilla, salt, baking soda, and cream of tartar, and mix with an electric mixer until slightly fluffy. With a spoon, gradually stir in flour until well mixed. Stir in cornflakes, oatmeal, coconut, walnuts, and chocolate chips. Drop by heaping tablespoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets, 2 inches apart. Bake in a preheated oven for 12 minutes, or until slightly brown. Remove from oven; allow cookies to cool 5 minutes on baking sheets before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
