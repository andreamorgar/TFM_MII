Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch Bundt pan. Sift together the cake flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Cream the butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well. Beat in the vanilla and lemon zest. Add half of the flour mixture and beat on medium speed to combine. Blend in the sour cream and milk; stir in the remaining flour mixture. Fold in the mint, basil, ginger, and peaches and mix until thoroughly combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until browned and a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn it out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
