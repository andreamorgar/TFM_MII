Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). To Make Crust: In a medium bowl, combine pretzels, sugar and butter. Press into a lightly greased 9 inch pie pan. Bake in preheated oven for 5 minutes. Let cool completely. To Make Filling: In a large bowl, combine limeade and condensed milk. Whisk in pudding mix. Allow mixture to set for 5 minutes. Stir in lime peel, then fold in whipped topping. Stir in green food coloring if desired. Pour mixture into cooled pie crust. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.
