Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Stir together bread crumbs, oil, cheese, garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, and table salt. Scrub reserved shells inside and out and dry thoroughly. Spread kosher salt about 1/4 inch deep in a large shallow (1-inch-deep) baking pan and nestle shells in salt to keep them level. Return shucked mussels to shells and top each with about 1 teaspoon bread crumb mixture. Bake mussels in middle of oven until crumbs are golden brown and crisp, about 7 minutes. Cool slightly and brush salt from bottoms of mussel shells before serving.
