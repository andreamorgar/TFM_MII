Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar and white sugar. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Combine the flour, salt and baking soda, stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, stir in the granola, raisins and peanuts. Drop dough by heaping teaspoonfuls onto greased cookie sheets, about 2 inches apart. Bake 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until cookies are lightly browned around edges. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks.
