Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Spray with cooking spray. Cook the cabbage, red cabbage, and carrots in the hot skillet until they begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Stir in the garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Continue to cook and stir until cabbage and carrots are soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir balsamic vinegar into the cabbage mixture just before removing from heat.
