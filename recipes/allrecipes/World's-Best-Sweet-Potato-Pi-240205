Place sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 40 to 50 minutes. Drain water, peel sweet potatoes, and mash in a bowl. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Mix butter and eggs together in a bowl until smooth; stir into mashed sweet potatoes. Mix milk, sugar, flour, vanilla extract, nutmeg, baking powder, and lemon juice into sweet potato mixture; pour into the 3 pie shells. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue to bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of a pie comes out clean, about 40 minutes more. Cool pies for 15 to 30 minutes before refrigerating to cool completely, 1 to 2 hours.
