Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium mixing bowl, beat softened cream cheese until fluffy. Mix in sugar until well combined. Add eggs and vanilla. Beat until smooth. Fold in all but 1/2 cup of chopped candy bars. Sprinkle reserved 1/2 cup of chopped candy bars onto bottom of graham cracker crust. Pour cream cheese mixture into crust. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes; do not brown on top. Will be soft in middle. Chill before serving.
