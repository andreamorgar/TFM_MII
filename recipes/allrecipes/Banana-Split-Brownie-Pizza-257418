Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a pizza pan with parchment paper. Stir brownie mix, oil, eggs, and water in a bowl until well blended. Spread on the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Let cool completely, about 15 minutes. Mix crushed pineapple, cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Spread over cooled brownie. Arrange banana and strawberry slices over cream cheese layer. Drizzle chocolate syrup and sprinkle peanuts on top. Cut "pizza" into slices.
