Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir taco seasoning mix and ranch dressing mix into the ground beef; add shoepeg corn, diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, red kidney beans, black beans, pinto beans, chicken broth, and diced tomatoes. Bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring occasionally; cook until the tomatoes are softened, 30 to 60 minutes.
