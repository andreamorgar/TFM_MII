Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Beat the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Blend the egg and the almond flavoring into the creamed butter and sugar. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a bowl. Blend the flour mixture into the butter mixture. Fold the pineapple tidbits and coconut flakes into the dough. Drop teaspoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto greased baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
