Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat two 9-inch pie pans with vegetable oil cooking spray. Beat eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the ricotta cheese, vanilla, cinnamon, sugar, zest, and whiskey. Pour into prepared pans. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, until firm. Let cool, then refrigerate until cold.
