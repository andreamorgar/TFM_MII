Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix flour and salt together. Pour milk, sugar and oil into one measuring cup, and add all at once to flour. Stir until mixed. Pat dough onto the bottom and sides of a 2 quart casserole dish. Spread fruit filling over dough and sprinkle with cinnamon. In a medium bowl, combine eggs, sour cream and vanilla. Mix until smooth and pour over fruit filling. Sprinkle top with cinnamon. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 60 minutes, or until topping is set. Allow to cool and store in the refrigerator.
