Rinse livers, pat dry and place in a resealable plastic bag. In a small bowl mix the flour, garlic powder, salt and pepper and add mixture to chicken livers. Seal bag and shake bag to coat. Set aside. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Remove bacon, leaving bacon fat in skillet, and set aside. Cook coated chicken livers in bacon fat covered over medium high heat until almost done, about 17 to 20 minutes. Add bacon strips and cook together until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
