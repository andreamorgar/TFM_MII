Combine the water and 1 tablespoon salt in a shallow container. Soak the fish in the salt water for 10 minutes. Mix the turmeric, coriander, paprika, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Remove fish from the salt water and pat dry with paper towels. Coat fish on both sides with spice mixture. Heat the olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook fish in hot oil until it flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes per side. Serve garnished with cilantro.
