Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Rinse chicken pieces and pat dry. In a shallow dish or bowl, mix together the taco seasoning mix and tortilla chip crumbs. Roll chicken pieces in chip mixture and place coated chicken in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Turn chicken pieces and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes.
