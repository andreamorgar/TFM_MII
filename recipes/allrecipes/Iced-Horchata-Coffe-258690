Combine rice, water, and almonds in a blender. Blend mixture until well combined, about 2 minutes. Mixture will be coarse. Strain mixture through a fine sieve or cheesecloth into a pitcher; discard solids. Stir in cold brew concentrate and blue agave. Serve over ice. Garnish with cinnamon sticks, if desired.
