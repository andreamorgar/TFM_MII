Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x12-inch baking pan with shortening. Mix sugar, flour, baking cocoa, butter, walnuts, dark cocoa, eggs, water, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl until batter is smooth. Pour the mixture into the baking pan; top with bananas. Bake in preheated oven until top is dry and edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 30 minutes.
