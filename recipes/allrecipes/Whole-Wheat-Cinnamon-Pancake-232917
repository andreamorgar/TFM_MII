Whisk buttermilk, eggs, and milk together in a bowl until blended; add oats and whisk until oats are wet, about 30 seconds. Set aside until oats absorb some liquid, about 5 minutes. Stir flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, baking soda, and cinnamon into the oat mixture; whisk until completely blended into a batter. Melt 1/2 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Ladle batter into the skillet and cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip with a spatula and continue cooking until browned on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining butter and batter.
