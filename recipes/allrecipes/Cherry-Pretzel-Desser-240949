Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix pretzels, melted butter, and sugar together in a bowl; press into the bottom of a 13x9-inch baking dish. Bake crust in preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove to cool completely. Stir cream cheese and confectioners' sugar together in a bowl. Fold whipped topping with the cream cheese mixture until smooth; spread over the cooled pretzel crust. Spread cherry pie filling over the cream cheese layer.
