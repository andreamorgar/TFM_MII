In a medium size mixing bowl, blend together butter or margarine and flour. Mix in the Cheddar cheese, salt, red pepper, hot pepper sauce, and pecans. Form the dough into a roll, wrap in parchment paper, and refrigerate over night. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slice dough into very thin wafers. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until crisp.
