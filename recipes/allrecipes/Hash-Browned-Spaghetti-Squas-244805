Place spaghetti squash in a microwave-safe baking dish, cut-side down, pour in water, and cover dish with plastic wrap. Poke a few holes in the plastic wrap for ventilation. Cook on microwave until tender, 6 to 9 minutes. Remove plastic wrap and allow to cool until easily handled. Heat canola oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, red bell pepper, garlic, and Italian seasoning in the hot oil until onion is tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Set skillet aside, keeping vegetables warm. Run a fork along the flesh of the squash, pulling it into strands. Fluff strands to separate as much as possible and transfer to a bowl. Mix flour and Parmesan cheese into the strands. Add onion mixture and mix well. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Spoon about 1/4 cup squash mixture into the hot butter and press to form a 1-inch-thick patty. Cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining squash mixture.
