Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fettuccine in the boiling water until pasta floats to the top, 2 to 5 minutes; drain and transfer pasta to a bowl. Combine Alfredo sauce, figs, prosciutto, and black pepper in the same saucepan used for pasta; cook and stir over medium heat until warmed, 5 to 10 minutes. Add pasta to Alfredo sauce mixture and mix well; transfer to a serving bowl and top with Parmesan cheese.
