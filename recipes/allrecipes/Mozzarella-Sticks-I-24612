In a medium bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and white pepper. Gradually pour in beer. Whisk briskly. Cover and allow the mixture to stand 90 minutes. In a large, deep skillet, heat safflower oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Whip the egg white into the batter. Dip mozzarella cheese sticks into the batter. With a slotted metal spoon, place coated cheese sticks a few at a time into the hot oil. Fry 2 1/2 to 3 minutes, until crisp and golden brown. Drain on paper towels and serve hot.
