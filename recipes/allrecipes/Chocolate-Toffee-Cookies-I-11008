Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees F). Beat butter and sugar in large bowl until fluffy. Add egg, rum, and vanilla and beat until well blended. Sift flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt into small bowl. Stir dry ingredients into butter mixture. Mix in toffee and chopped almonds. Drop batter by heaping tablespoonfuls onto heavy large ungreased baking sheet, spacing 2 inches apart. Bake until cookies puff slightly and crack on top but are still soft to tough, about 11 minutes. Let cookies cool on sheet 1 minutes. Transfer cookies to rack and cool completely. Repeat shaping and baking with remaining batter.
