Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour the olive oil into an ovenproof pan. Stir the garlic, cumin, and cayenne pepper into the olive oil and mix well. Add the garbanzo beans and toss to coat evenly. Bake in preheated oven until garbanzo beans turn golden, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven, and sprinkle with feta cheese and thyme. Serve warm.
