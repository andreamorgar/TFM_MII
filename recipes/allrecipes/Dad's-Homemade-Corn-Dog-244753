Combine cornmeal, flour, white sugar, baking powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl; stir in milk and egg until batter is smooth. Refrigerate until batter is chilled. Bring a large pot of water to a boil; cook hot dogs until heated through, about 7 minutes. Let hot dogs rest for 10 minutes and dry hot dogs on a paper towel. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Insert 1 skewer into each hot dog. Pour batter into a large drinking glass. Dip hot dogs into the batter until well coated. Fry 2 to 3 hot dogs at a time in the hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
