Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix graham cracker crumbs and butter together in a bowl; press graham cracker mixture into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until set and golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool completely, about 20 minutes. Beat milk and vanilla pudding mix together until smooth. Fold in 1 container of whipped topping; fold shredded coconut into filling mixture. Pour filling over crust; smooth with a spatula until even. Spread the second container of whipped topping over filling; top with toasted coconut. Refrigerate until set, about 2 hours. Cut into bars.
