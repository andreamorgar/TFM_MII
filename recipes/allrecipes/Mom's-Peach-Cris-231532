Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange peaches evenly in an 8x8-inch baking dish. Mix flour, brown sugar, butter, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl using a pastry cutter until evenly crumbled. Fold oats into flour mixture; sprinkle and press topping into peaches. Bake in the preheated oven until topping is lightly browned, about 30 minutes.
