Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Stir together flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Add cream, then stir just until a dough forms. Drop heaping 1/4 cups of batter about 1 inch apart on an ungreased large baking sheet. Bake in middle of oven until tops are pale golden and bottoms are golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.
