Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Cream the sugar and butter. Add flour, nuts, salt and vanilla. Mix well. Batter will be very crumbly. Shape into 1 inch balls. Bake for 15 minutes, remove from oven and allow to cool for 3 minutes. Roll in super fine sugar. When cool, roll again, if desired.
