Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Spoon cooked pasta over the butter, without stirring. Season pasta with paprika, salt, and pepper. Pour eggs over pasta and cook, without stirring, until eggs begin to set, about 2 minutes. Cook and stir eggs and pasta until eggs are nearly set, about 5 minutes. Cover skillet and remove from heat; allow to sit until eggs are set, 2 to 5 minutes.
