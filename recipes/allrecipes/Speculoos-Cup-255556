Place chocolate in top of a double boiler over simmering water; heat, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides, until melted and smooth, about 5 minutes. Scoop 1 1/2 teaspoon melted chocolate into 12 silicone or paper cupcake liners; spread evenly around the bottom and partway up the sides with a spoon. Chill until set, 10 to 15 minutes. Mix cookie butter and crushed cookies together in a small bowl to make filling. Drop teaspoonfuls of the filling over the chilled chocolate. Cover with remaining melted chocolate, smoothing the tops with a spoon. Chill until set, about 30 minutes.
