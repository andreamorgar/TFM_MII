Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease 12 tartlet pans. Divide rolls in half and press into the prepared tartlet pans. Set aside. In a large bowl, combine cream cheese, crab, mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, Cheddar cheese, green onions and Worcestershire sauce. Spoon 1 teaspoon of mixture into tarts and garnish with paprika. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes, or until light brown. These freeze wonderfully. Just reheat before serving.
