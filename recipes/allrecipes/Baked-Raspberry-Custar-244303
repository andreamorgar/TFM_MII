Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a deep-dish pie pan. Spread raspberries into the prepared pan and top with 1/4 cup white sugar. Blend milk, eggs, 1 1/4 cups white sugar, flour, unsalted butter, vanilla extract, and salt together in a blender until smooth and creamy; slowly pour over raspberries. Sprinkle coarse sugar over the floating raspberries. Bake in the preheated oven until custard is raised in the middle and top is lightly browned, 45 to 50 minutes.
