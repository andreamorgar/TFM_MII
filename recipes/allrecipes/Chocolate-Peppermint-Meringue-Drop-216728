Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Beat egg whites, cream of tartar, and peppermint oil together in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until soft peaks form. Beat in sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time; beat in food coloring if desired, until the mixture is glossy and forms stiff peaks. Very gently fold in the crushed candy canes and chocolate chips. Drop the meringue by tablespoon onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until dry, 28 to 33 minutes. Cool the cookies on baking sheet on a rack for 20 minutes before removing from parchment paper.
