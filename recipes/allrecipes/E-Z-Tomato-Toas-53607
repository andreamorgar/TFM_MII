Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange the tomato wedges in a single layer in a skillet over high heat, and cook 1 minute, until lightly scorched. Reduce heat to medium-low. Drizzle tomatoes with olive oil, and mix the garlic into the skillet. Gently cook and stir until tomatoes and garlic are tender. Remove from heat. Arrange the baguette slices on a baking sheet, and toast 5 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly brown. Spread toasted slices with butter, top with the tomatoes, and season with salt and pepper to serve.
