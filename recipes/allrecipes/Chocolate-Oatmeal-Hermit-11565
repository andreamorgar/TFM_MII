Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat pan with vegetable oil spray. In a medium bowl, cream together sugar, brown sugar, vegetable oil, egg whites, and vanilla with an electric mixer. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. With a wooden spoon, stir in the quick cooking oats and chocolate chips. Drop dough by level tablespoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks.
