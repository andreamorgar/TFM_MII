Combine sorrel, ginger, dried orange zest, and clove in a bowl. Bring water to a boil in a saucepan or kettle; pour over sorrel mixture. Stir in sugar until dissolved. Let mixture steep at room temperature, 8 hours to overnight. Strain sorrel mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a pitcher; discard solids. Serve over ice.
