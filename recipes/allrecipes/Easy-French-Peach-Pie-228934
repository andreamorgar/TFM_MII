Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Press pie pastry into a 9-inch pie pan. Fill prepared pie crust with peaches. Mix sugar, egg, flour, butter, and cinnamon together in a bowl; pour over peaches. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C); bake until peach filling is bubbling and crust is lightly browned, 40 to 45 minutes.
