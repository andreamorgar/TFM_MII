Crush the ramen noodles in a bowl, and stir in the beef seasoning packet, sunflower seeds, almonds, green onions, oil and vinegar dressing, and sugar, mixing until the sugar is dissolved. Place the coleslaw mix into a large salad bowl, pour the dressing mixture over, and toss lightly to combine well. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving.
