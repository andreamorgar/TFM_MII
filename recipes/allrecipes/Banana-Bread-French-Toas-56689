In a shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs, sweetened condensed milk and vanilla with a fork. Set aside. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Slice banana bread into 4 thick slices. Dip each slice into the egg mixture, then place in the hot pan. Cook on each side until golden brown. Dust with confectioners' sugar just before serving, if desired.
