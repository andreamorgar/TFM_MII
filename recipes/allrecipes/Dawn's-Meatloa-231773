Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix ground beef, egg, oats, onion, milk, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; transfer into a loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 50 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
