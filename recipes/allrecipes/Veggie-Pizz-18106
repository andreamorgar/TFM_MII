Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Unroll crescent roll dough and lay flat on a baking sheet (do not separate sections). Bake in preheated oven for 11 to 13 minutes, until golden brown. Remove and allow to cool. While crust is baking, mix together cream cheese and sour cream until smooth. Stir in dill. When crust is cool, spread cream cheese mixture evenly over top and cover with carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, and green pepper. Chill approximately 5 minutes, until cream cheese mixture is firm. Cut into 4 portions and serve.
