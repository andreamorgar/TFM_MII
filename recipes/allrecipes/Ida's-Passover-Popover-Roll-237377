Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bring water, oil, sugar, and salt to a boil in a saucepan. Remove from heat and quickly stir in matzo meal. Beat eggs one at a time into matzo mixture until blended. With wet hands, roll dough into 18 rolls and arrange on a baking sheet. Cut an 'X' into each roll. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 45 minutes.
