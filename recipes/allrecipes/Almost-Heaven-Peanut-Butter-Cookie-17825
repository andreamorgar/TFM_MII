Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine the pie crust mix, peanut butter and brown sugar. Incorporate the water, one tablespoon at a time, while mixing gently. Roll into 1 inch balls. Place onto a cookie sheet and flatten slightly with a fork. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
