Heat 2 inches of oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat pancake mix, milk, and egg together in a bowl; stir in corn and pepper until batter is smooth. Working in batches, drop batter by the rounded teaspoonful into hot oil and cook fritters until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer cooked fritters to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Melt raspberry preserves in a saucepan over low heat; remove from heat and stir mayonnaise into preserves until smooth. Serve fritters with raspberry mayonnaise.
