Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk butter and lemon pepper seasoning together in a large bowl. Place onions in the preheated oil and cook until just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Remove and discard onions. Working in batches, cook wings in oil until crispy on the outside and cooked through, about 8 minutes. Remove wings to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. Toss wings with lemon pepper mixture until completely coated. Return to paper towel-lined plate to drain excess liquid.
