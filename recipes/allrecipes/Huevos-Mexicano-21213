In a large bowl, lightly beat eggs. Stir in chopped tomato, onion, green pepper and jalapeno. In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Toss in the tortilla strips and cook briefly until soft. Add the egg and vegetable mixture and stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, until eggs are set. Sprinkle with cheese and serve hot.
