Combine milk and oats together in a bowl; allow oats to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir pancake mix, banana, chocolate chips, walnuts, egg white, flax seeds, and olive oil into milk-oats mixture until batter is just mixed. Preheat and grease a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Scoop about 1/4 cup batter into preheated waffle iron and cook according to manufacturer's instructions until golden brown, 2 to 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
