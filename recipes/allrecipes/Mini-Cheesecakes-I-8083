Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line muffin tin with foil liners. Place 1 vanilla wafer in each liner. Mix cream cheese, vanilla, and sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Add eggs, and mix well. Pour over wafers, filling 3/4 full. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes or until set. Remove from pan when cool. Chill before serving.
