Break the ground beef into small pieces into a large pot over medium-high heat. Stir green bell pepper, onion, seasoned salt, 1 1/2 teaspoon ground annatto seed, 1 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, 1 1/2 teaspoon paprika, and 1 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes through the ground beef; cook and stir until the beef is completely browned, about 10 minutes. Pour diced tomatoes, pinto beans, black beans, and red beans into the pot; season with chili seasoning, 1 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, 1 1/2 teaspoon paprika, 1 1/2 teaspoon ground annatto seed, 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, and garlic. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the beans are tender, about 20 minutes.
