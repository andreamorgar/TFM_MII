Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and almond extract. Combine the flour and salt; stir into the creamed mixture until well blended. Mix in 1/2 cup of the cherries. Press the dough into an ungreased 9x13 inch baking pan. Sprinkle with remaining cherries and crushed candies. Press in lightly. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are lightly browned. Cool completely in the pan before icing. To make the icing, mix together the confectioners' sugar and water until a drizzling consistency is reached.
