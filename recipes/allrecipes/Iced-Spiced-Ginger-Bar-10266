Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease a 15 x 10 or 13 x 9 inch pan. In a large bowl, combine flour, white sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, salt, coffee, 1 cup butter or margarine, molasses, and eggs. Beat 2 minutes at medium speed. Pour into prepared pan. Bake for 25-30 minutes. Let cool. To Make Frosting: In a small saucepan over low heat, cook 1/3 cup butter or margarine until light golden brown, stirring constantly. Add confectioner's sugar, vanilla and water. Blend until smooth (may need to add more water). Spread over cooled bars.
