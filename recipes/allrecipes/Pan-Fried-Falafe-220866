Place chickpeas in a food processor; puree to a thick paste. Place onion, parsley, and garlic in the food processor; puree with chickpeas until combined. Transfer to a bowl. Whisk egg, cumin, coriander, salt, baking powder, lemon juice, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl. Stir egg mixture and 1 tablespoon olive oil into chickpea mixture until well mixed. Slowly stir bread crumbs into chickpea mixture until it holds together but is not sticky. Adjust with more or less bread crumbs as needed. Form mixture into balls and flatten into small patties. Pour olive oil to 1 inch deep in a large cast iron skillet; place over medium-high heat. Fry patties in hot oil until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
