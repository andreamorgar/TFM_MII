Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch Bundt cake pan. In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Next, stir in the milk. Finally, stir in the vanilla wafers, coconut and nuts. Pour into the prepared pan. Bake for 1 1/2 hours in the preheated oven. Allow cake to cool in the pan for at least 10 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack.
