Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 7x11-inch baking dish. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in ground sausage. Cook and stir until sausage is crumbly and evenly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove sausage from skillet and drain all but 2 tablespoons of drippings. Cook and stir onion and bell pepper in the reserved drippings until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix sausage, onion, bell pepper, sour cream, Cheddar cheese, Swiss cheese, garlic powder, hot pepper sauce, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl; mix in beaten eggs until incorporated. Pour mixture into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown and center is set, 50 to 55 minutes. Allow to cool 10 minutes before serving.
