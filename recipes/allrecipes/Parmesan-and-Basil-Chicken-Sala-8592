Season chicken with salt and pepper. Roast at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 35 minutes, or until juices run clear. Let cool, and chop into chunks. In a food processor, puree the mayonnaise, basil, garlic, and celery. Combine the chunked chicken, pureed mixture, and Parmesan cheese; toss. Refrigerate, and serve.
