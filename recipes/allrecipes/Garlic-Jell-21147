In a food processor or blender, blend the garlic and 1/2 cup of vinegar until smooth. In a 6 to 8 quart saucepan, combine the garlic mixture, remaining 1 1/2 cups vinegar and sugar. Over high heat bring the mixture to a boil, stirring constantly. Quickly add the pectin. Return the mixture to a boil and boil hard for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat. Immediately fill five, sterilized half pint jars with the jelly, leaving 1/4-inch head space. Wipe the jar tops and threads clean. Place hot sealing lids on the jars and apply the screw on rings loosely. Process in boiling water in a deep canning pot for 5 minutes. Remove the jars and cool completely. Tighten the jar screw rings to complete the sealing process.
