Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a large bowl, cream the shortening and sugar. Add the egg and beat until light and fluffy, then stir in the molasses. In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda, salt, ginger and cinnamon. Add to the egg mixture and stir until well blended. Roll bits of dough into 1 inch balls. Dip each ball in sugar and place on cookie sheet, sugared side up about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until cookies have spread and tops have cracked. Let cool on wire rack.
