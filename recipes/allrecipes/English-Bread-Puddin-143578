Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine bread and milk, and set aside to soak for 5 minutes. Then stir in egg, butter, raisins, mixed fruit, SPLENDA(R) Brown Sugar Blend, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Mix well. Press the mixture into a 9-inch square baking pan. Bake in preheated oven until golden and firm to touch, about 35 minutes. Leave in baking pan to cool, then cut into squares.
