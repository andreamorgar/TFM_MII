Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat with garlic powder and minced garlic. Set aside. Sprinkle both sides of each steak with salt and pepper. Grill steaks 4 to 5 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. When done, transfer to warmed plates. Brush tops liberally with garlic butter, and allow to rest for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.
