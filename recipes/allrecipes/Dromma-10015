Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Place butter in a large heavy skillet and cook over medium-low heat without stirring for about 15 minutes, or until butter is a light tan color. Pour into mixing bowl. Place over a bowl of cold water and chill until firm. Add sugar, baking powder, vanilla and cardamom; beat until combined. Stir in flour. Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Place 1 inch apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. Top each with an almond; press almond slightly into dough. Bake until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove to wire rack and cool.
