Preheat oven to 390 degrees F (199 degrees C). Mix condensed chicken soup, mayonnaise, cream, onion, lemon juice, curry powder, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Add chopped chicken; stir to combine. Divide chicken mixture equally in the center of each crepe. Fold sides and roll crepes. Place rolled crepes, seam-side down, in a baking dish. Sprinkle crepes with Cheddar cheese and drizzle with 1/3 cup cream. Bake in preheated oven until crepes are heated through and Cheddar cheese is golden and bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes.
