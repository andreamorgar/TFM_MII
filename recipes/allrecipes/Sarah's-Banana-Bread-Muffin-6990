Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place muffin cups in muffin tin, or grease with a little butter. Mix sugar, oil, and egg until creamy and light yellow in a bowl. Add bananas and walnuts. Add flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir until completely smooth. Spoon the batter into the muffin tin. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until toothpick poked in center muffin comes out clean.
