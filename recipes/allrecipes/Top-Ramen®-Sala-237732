Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread ramen noodles, sunflower seeds, and almonds onto a baking sheet. Bake noodles, sunflower seeds, and almonds in the preheated oven until fragrant and toasted, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Combine coleslaw mix and green onions in a large bowl. Pour cooled noodle mixture over the top. Whisk olive oil, reserved ramen seasoning packets, vinegar, sugar, and black pepper together in a bowl until dressing is smooth. Pour dressing over coleslaw and toss to coat.
