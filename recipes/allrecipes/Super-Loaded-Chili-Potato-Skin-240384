Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Scrub potatoes and dry well. Pierce several times with tip of knife; arrange on large baking sheet. Bake 45 minutes or until tender. Cool. Slice each potato in half; scoop out flesh (reserve for mashing or potato pancakes), leaving 1/4-inch shell. Brush inside and outside of each potato half with oil; season with salt and pepper. Arrange potato halves on baking sheet. Bake 10 minutes, until crisp and golden brown, turning once. Spoon chili into potato shells; top with cheese. Bake 3 to 5 minutes or until cheese is melted. Top with sour cream and green onions.
