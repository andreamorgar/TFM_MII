Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place apples in a 9x9 inch square baking dish. In a bowl, mix together oats, baking mix, sugar, cinnamon and cloves. Stir in applesauce and vanilla and sprinkle crumble mixture over apples. Drizzle melted butter evenly over topping. Bake in preheated oven 30 minutes, until apples are tender and top is golden.
