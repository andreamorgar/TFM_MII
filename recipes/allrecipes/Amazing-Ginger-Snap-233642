Mix flour, 1 cup sugar, canola oil, molasses, egg, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, and salt in a bowl. Refrigerate dough for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour 1/4 cup sugar into a bowl. Roll dough into 1-inch balls and coat each ball in sugar. Flatten each coated ball onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until edges begin to harden, 7 to 8 minutes. Cool on the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
