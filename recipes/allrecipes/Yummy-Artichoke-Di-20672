Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix the artichoke hearts, mayonnaise, 1 cup Parmesan, cream cheese and green chile peppers. Scoop the mixture into a pie pan or medium baking pan. Top with the remaining 1/2 cup of Parmesan. Bake for 25 minutes or until bubbly and slightly browned. Serve warm.
