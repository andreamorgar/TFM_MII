Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a large bowl, cream together the shortening, white sugar and brown sugar. Mix in the egg and vanilla until well blended. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; stir into the batter until well blended. Mix in the oats, coconut and chocolate chips until evenly distributed. Roll dough into walnut sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are lightly browned.
