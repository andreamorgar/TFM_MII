In a medium bowl, whip cream with vanilla until stiff peaks form. Fold whipped cream into remaining cream cheese. Line a 7x11 inch dish with parchment paper. Place 10 ladyfingers in the bottom of the dish. Spoon one-half of the coffee mixture over the cookies. Top with one-half of the whipped cream mixture. Repeat layers. Sprinkle with cocoa.
