Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Combine sausage, cheese and about 2 cups of the baking mix; use hands to mix well. Gradually add in as much of the additional baking mix as possible. Roll into 1 to 1 1/2 inch balls. Roll balls in any excess baking mix to coat. Place on non-stick baking sheet and bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 20 minutes or until golden brown.
