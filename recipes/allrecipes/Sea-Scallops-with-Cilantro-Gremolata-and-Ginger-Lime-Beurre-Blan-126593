Make gremolata: Stir together cilantro, garlic, and zest in a small bowl. Make beurre blanc: Simmer shallot and ginger in lime juice and wine in a small heavy saucepan until liquid is reduced to about 2 tablespoons. Whisk in butter 1 tablespoon at a time, adding each new piece before previous one has completely melted and occasionally lifting pan from heat to cool mixture. (Sauce must not get too hot or it will separate.) Pour sauce through a fine sieve into a bowl (discard solids), then return to cleaned pan. Season with salt and white pepper and keep warm while cooking scallops. Saute scallops: Pat scallops dry and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then saute scallops, turning once, until golden and just cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes total. Sprinkle scallops with gremolata and serve with sauce.
