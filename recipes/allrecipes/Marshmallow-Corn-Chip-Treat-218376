Butter a 9x13-inch pan. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the marshmallow creme and stir until melted. Stir in the corn chips, making sure they are well coated with the marshmallow mixture. Using buttered spatula or waxed paper, press mixture evenly and firmly into the prepared pan. Cut into squares when cool.
