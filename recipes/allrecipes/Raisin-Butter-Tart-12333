Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the sugar using a fork until well blended. Stir in the melted butter, lemon juice, nutmeg, and raisins. Fill tart shells half full. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Allow tarts to stand for a few minutes in the pans before removing to racks to cool.
