Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix white sugar and cinnamon together in a large resealable bag; add biscuits and seal. Shake bag until biscuits are coated in cinnamon-sugar. Arrange half the apples and half the pecans in a round formation in an 8x8-inch pan; top with half the coated biscuits. Arrange half the remaining apples and pecans in a second layer and top with coated biscuits. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; dissolve brown sugar and vanilla extract in the melted butter. Pour butter-sugar mixture over biscuit mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are cooked through, about 35 minutes. Cool fritters in pan for 10 minutes before serving.
