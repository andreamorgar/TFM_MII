Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Combine the kiwi, mango, and banana in a bowl. Process the strawberries in a blender until they are liquefied and pour over fruit mixture. Stir to coat and refrigerate. Coat both sides of each tortilla with the cooking spray. Cut them into triangle-shaped wedges and place on a baking sheet. Sprinkle cinnamon sugar evenly over the chips. Bake in preheated oven until golden-brown, about 10 minutes. Allow to cool and serve with the fruit mixture.
