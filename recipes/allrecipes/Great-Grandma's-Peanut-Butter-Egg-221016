Place potato into a saucepan and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain. Mash potato in a bowl until no lumps remain; set aside to cool. Mix peanut butter, egg white, margarine, and confectioners' sugar in a bowl to make a stiff mixture that holds its shape when formed. Mix in the cooled mashed potato. Cover and refrigerate peanut butter filling overnight. Place chocolate chips into a microwave-safe bowl and heat in microwave on high power for 1 minute; stir. Continue to heat and stir the chocolate chips in 15-second intervals until just warm and smoothly melted; do not overheat. Scoop up about 1 tablespoon (or desired amount) of peanut butter filling, form into an egg shape, and dip into the melted chocolate. Set chocolate-covered egg aside on waxed paper to set up. Repeat with remaining filling and chocolate. Refrigerate leftovers.
