Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the blueberries, strawberries, and sliced bananas into a mixing bowl. Sprinkle with the sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, flour, and gluten; mix gently. Pour the fruit mixture into the pie shell, cover with the top crust, and pinch the seams shut. Cut slits in the top crust with a knife to create slots for the steam. Place the pie onto a baking sheet to catch drips. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 35 minutes.
