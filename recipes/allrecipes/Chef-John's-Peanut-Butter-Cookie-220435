Add egg and mix for about 1 minute. Slowly mix in flour with the mixer on low. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beater. Mix on medium until combined, about 30 seconds. Form dough into a ball, cover with plastic and refrigerate for 2-3 hours. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Portion out cookie dough in equal-sized balls on a baking sheet covered with a silicone baking mat. Use damp hands to roll dough into smooth balls. Stamp each ball with a fork in a criss-cross pattern. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes until golden. Leave on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.
