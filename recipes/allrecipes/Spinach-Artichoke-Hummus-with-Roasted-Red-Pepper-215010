Heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and sesame seeds; cook and stir until garlic is tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. Heat water in another skillet. Add spinach. Cook and stir until spinach is wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain and set aside. Place the garbanzo beans into a blender. Cover, and puree until smooth. Add the spinach, artichokes, and garlic mixture. Blend to desired consistency, pouring in reserved garbanzo bean liquid as needed. Spoon mixture into a bowl. Cover and refrigerate until chilled. Top with roasted red peppers before serving.
