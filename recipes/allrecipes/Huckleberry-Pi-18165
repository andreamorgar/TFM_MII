Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place huckleberries in pastry-lined pan. In a small bowl, mix together 3/4 cup sugar and flour. Spoon evenly over berries. Sprinkle lemon rind and lemon juice over top. Dot with butter. Cover with top crust. Seal edges and cut steam vents in top. Brush surface with cream, avoiding fluted edges of crust. Sprinkle with 2 teaspoons sugar. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake an additional 20 to 25 minutes, until crust is golden brown.
