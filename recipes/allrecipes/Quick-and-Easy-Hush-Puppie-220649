Mix corn muffin mix, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a bowl until blended. Stir eggs and evaporated milk into dry ingredients until moistened. Stir cream-style corn into mixture to make a moist batter. Let batter stand while oil heats. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Gently drop a teaspoon of batter at a time into the hot oil, staying as close to the oil as possible to avoid splattering. Fry hush puppies until golden brown, about 3 minutes per batch. Remove hush puppies with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Sprinkle with salt if desired.
