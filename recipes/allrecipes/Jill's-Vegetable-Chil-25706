In a large pot over medium heat, cook turkey until browned. Stir in onions, cover and cook 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, chili powder, cumin and cinnamon and cook until fragrant, about a minute. Pour in tomatoes and bring to a boil. Stir in broth, kidney beans, pinto beans and corn and bring to a boil again. Then reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes, or until thoroughly heated.
