Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix flour, 1/2 cup sugar, shortening, 2 eggs, baking powder, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl until dough comes together. Press dough into a 9-inch pie dish, reserving about 1 tablespoon of dough for topping. Beat ricotta cheese, 3/4 cup sugar, 2 eggs, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract in a bowl until smooth; pour cheese filling into prepared pie dish. Divide reserved dough into 3 balls. Flatten balls and arrange atop pie filling. Sprinkle a pinch of cinnamon and a pinch of sugar over pie, if desired. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown and filling begins to firm, about 75 minutes. Chill pie in refrigerator until fully firm, about 3 hours.
