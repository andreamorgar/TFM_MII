Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8 inch pans. Sift together the cake flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside. Using an electric mixer, whip the cream with the sugar until stiff peaks form. Beat in the eggs, then stir in the vanilla. Fold in the flour mixture, mixing just until incorporated. Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
