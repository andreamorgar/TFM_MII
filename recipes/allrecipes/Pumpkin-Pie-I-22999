Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together the pumpkin, sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and nutmeg. Blend in the eggs, milk and evaporated milk. Pour the mixture into the pie crust. Bake in the preheated oven 50 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool on a metal rack before serving.
