Preheat oven to 175 to 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Pour cream into shallow glass or ceramic baking dish (an 8- or 9-inch square pan is ideal). Cream should be about 1 1/2 to 2 inches deep. Place dish in preheated oven. Bake 12 hours. Do not stir. Carefully remove from oven and let cool to room temperature. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or until completely chilled. Turn over a corner of the top layer of thickened cream; carefully pour liquid underneath into a container to use for baking. Pack the thickened (clotted) cream into a ceramic crock or canning jar. Cover and refrigerate up to 5 days.
