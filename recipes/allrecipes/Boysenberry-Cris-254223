Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread boysenberries in a 7x11-inch baking pan. Mix flour, egg, baking powder, and salt together with a fork to make a crumble. Scatter over berries. Pour melted butter over crumble. Sprinkle sugar on top. Bake crisp until top is browned, 40 to 50 minutes.
