Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place a baking rack on top of a large baking sheet. Thread each slice of bacon onto a skewer; place skewered bacon on the baking rack. Bake bacon in the preheated oven until crisp; 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely. Combine chocolate chips and shortening in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave in 30 second intervals until chocolate is melted and smooth, stirring after each interval. Coat each side of the skewered bacon with the chocolate mixture using a pastry brush. Place coated bacon on a sheet of waxed paper. Refrigerate until firm, at least 30 minutes. Store in refrigerator until ready to serve.
