Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Press pie crust pastry into a 9-inch pie pan. Beat sugar, eggs, and salt together in a bowl until smooth. Mix coconut, butter, milk, and flour together in a separate bowl; stir coconut mixture into sugar mixture. Pour mixture into the pie crust. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Allow to cool completely for pie to fully set up.
