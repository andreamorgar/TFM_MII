Heat the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the cabbage; cook and stir until the cabbage has softened, about 20 minutes. While the cabbage is cooking, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the gnocchi and return to a boil. Cook until the gnocchi float to the top, about 3 minutes; drain. Stir the cooked gnocchi and ham into the cabbage and heat through. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
