Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place one pie crust in the bottom of a 9-inch pie plate. Mix elderberries, sour cream, sugar, flour, and almond extract together gently in a large bowl. Pour into pie crust and spread evenly. Place second pie crust on top; pinch edges to seal. Poke vent holes in the top crust with a sharp knife. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, about 45 minutes. Cool before serving, about 15 minutes.
