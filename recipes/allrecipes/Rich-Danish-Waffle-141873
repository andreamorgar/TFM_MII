Stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda in a bowl until well combined. Whisk together egg yolks, buttermilk, milk, vanilla extract, and butter in a large bowl until smooth. Whip egg whites in a clean bowl to soft peaks. Fold the flour mixture into the egg yolk mixture until blended, then fold in the whipped egg whites. Preheat a Belgian waffle iron and coat with cooking spray. Spoon about 1/2 cup of batter per waffle, depending on the size of your waffle iron, onto the center of the hot iron. Close the lid and cook until steam stops coming out and the waffle is golden brown, about 90 seconds.
