In a large bowl, dissolve the gelatin in boiling water. Drain the liquid from the blueberry and pineapple cans into a measuring cup and add enough water to make 1 cup of liquid. Stir the juice mixture, blueberries and crushed pineapple into the gelatin and pour into a 2 quart mold. Refrigerate until firm. Mix together softened cream cheese, sugar, sour cream and vanilla and spread over the congealed gelatin mixture. Sprinkle cream cheese layer with chopped pecans. Chill for approximately 30 more minutes, invert and serve.
