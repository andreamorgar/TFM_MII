Heat vegetable oil over medium heat in a large pot. Add ground beef, onion, bell pepper, and garlic. Cook until ground beef is browned and vegetables are starting to become tender. If desired, drain off fat. Stir black beans, red kidney beans, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato juice, chili powder, cumin, basil, oregano, salt, and black pepper into pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Serve with sour cream and cheese. [Cleaning tip: Once the stove top is cool, wipe up any oil splatters or spills with Clorox(R) Disinfecting Wipes*.]
