Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour egg beat into a shallow dish or bowl; do the same with the flour. Heat oil and margarine in a large, deep skillet over medium high heat. Dip wings in egg, then flour, then fry until browned and crisp. Lay browned wings in an 11x14 inch baking dish. To Make Sauce: In a small bowl combine the soy sauce, water, sugar, vinegar and MSG. Blend well and pour sauce over chicken. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour.
