Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Beat shortening, maple syrup, brown sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until combined. Stir oats, whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, sunflower seeds, golden raisins, dried pineapple, pineapple juice, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into the shortening mixture to make a sticky dough. Pinch off about 1 1/2 tablespoon of dough per cookie and roll into balls about 1 1/4 inch across; arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes.
