Place Bruce's(R) Yams Cut Sweet Potatoes and avocado in a blender or food processor, and process until smooth. Add half & half and process 30 seconds more. Transfer sweet potato mixture to a large saucepan along with chicken broth and white pepper. Heat until small bubbles appear around the edge of saucepan (do not boil). Reduce heat and simmer on low for 5 minutes; stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and stir in hot sauce. Divide between 6 warmed soup bowls and drizzle with avocado oil and sprinkle with a tiny amount of salt. Garnish each bowl with sliced Serrano pepper.
