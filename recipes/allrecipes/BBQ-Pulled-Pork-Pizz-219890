Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place the pizza crust onto a baking sheet. In a bowl, mix the barbeque sauce with chipotle chili powder; season with salt and black pepper. Spread the sauce over the pizza crust. Arrange pulled pork, sliced onion, and red bell pepper slices evenly over the pizza. Bake in the preheated oven until the toppings are hot and the pizza crust is crisp on the bottom, 12 to 15 minutes.
