Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease one 13x9 inch pan. Combine 1 cup of the sugar, the flour, baking powder, salt, ground cinnamon, shortening, and egg. Dough will be crumbly. Pat half of the dough into the prepared pan. Combine the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, the cornstarch and berries. Place mixture over dough in pan. Crumble the remaining dough over the tops of the berries. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 minutes or until the top is slightly brown.
