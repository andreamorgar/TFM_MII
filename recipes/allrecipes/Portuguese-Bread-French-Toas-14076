Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk together the eggs, milk, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and orange rind in a medium mixing bowl. Cut the bread into seven or eight slices, and lay them, overlapping, in a large baking dish. Pour the egg mixture over the bread, covering every slice. The bread should not be entirely submerged though; the higher parts should become toasted and crispy. Dot the bread with the butter. Bake the French toast in the oven for 35 to 45 minutes until the custard is set. Serve immediately.
