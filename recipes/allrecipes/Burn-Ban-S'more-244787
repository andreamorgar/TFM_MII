Arrange marshmallows in a small non-stick pan, adding more if needed to cover the bottom. Layer chocolate pieces on top of marshmallows. Cover pan and place over medium heat on the camp stove; cook until melted, trying not to stir the mixture. Scoop onto a graham cracker half and top with another graham cracker.
