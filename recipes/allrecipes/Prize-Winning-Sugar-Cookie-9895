Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Cream the margarine and sugar well. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Add the buttermilk. Sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, and baking powder and add to the creamed mixture. Add 1/4 cup of vanilla (yes, this is correct) and nutmeg, and blend well. Let dough rest for 10 minutes. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto greased cookie sheet. Sprinkle with additional sugar. Bake for 10 minutes.
