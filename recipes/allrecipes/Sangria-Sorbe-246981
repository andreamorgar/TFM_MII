Combine wine, water, raspberries, strawberries, apple, plum, grapefruit juice, orange zest and juice, and lemon zest and juice in a saucepan over medium heat; cook at just below a simmer for 30 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and cool to room temperature. Pour wine mixture into a blender and puree; strain through a fine-mesh sieve. Stir sugar into wine mixture and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour. Transfer wine mixture to an ice cream maker and follow manufacturer's instructions for sorbet.
