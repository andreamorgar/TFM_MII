Pour the apricot nectar into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in gelatin mix until completely dissolved. Whisk in sour cream until smooth or process in a blender. Pour into a serving bowl, and stir in the apricots. Chill until set, about 3 hours. Top with whipped topping just before serving.
