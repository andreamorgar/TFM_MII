Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Drain one can of the mixed vegetables and pour both cans into a 2 quart casserole dish (one with a lid, preferably). Pour cream of celery soup over vegetables (use only one can for a drier casserole); gently stir until well mixed. Spread fried onions over vegetables and then spread the stuffing on top of the onions. Pour melted butter over stuffing; cover dish with a lid or with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Cool for a few minutes before serving.
