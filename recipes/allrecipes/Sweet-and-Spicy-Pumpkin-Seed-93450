Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking pan with aluminum foil. Stir together the pumpkin seeds and butter in a bowl. Add the salt, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, and hot pepper sauce; stir. Spread the seeds in a single layer on the baking pan. Bake in preheated oven until crispy, about 45 minutes.
