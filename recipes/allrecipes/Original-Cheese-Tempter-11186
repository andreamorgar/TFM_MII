Wrap the rolls in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cut rolls into 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick slices. Place on a parchment paper lined baking sheet and press a pecan half or piece onto the top of each cookie. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 12 minutes or until set.
