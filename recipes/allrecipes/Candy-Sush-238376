Combine marshmallows and butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat; cook and stir until melted, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir rice cereal into marshmallow mixture until evenly coated. Remove saucepan from heat and cool mixture until easily handled, about 10 minutes. Unroll fruit rolls onto a work surface. Cut licorice to fit the length of each fruit roll. Spoon rice mixture onto half of each fruit roll. Place a piece of licorice on top of 1 rice mixture edge. Starting on the licorice edge, roll fruit roll around rice mixture ending with the fruit roll edge without rice mixture to seal. Repeat with remaining fruit rolls. Dip a knife in water and slice 'sushi' into equal-size pieces.
