Place noodles in a bowl of warm water and soak for 15 minutes or until soft. Whisk together the oil, sugar, vinegar and seasoning packs. Drain the noodles and combine in a large bowl with the coleslaw, oranges, water chestnuts, green onions and sunflower seeds. Pour dressing over salad and toss to coat evenly. Refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours. Add cashews before serving.
