In a medium bowl, mix together the skim milk, evaporated milk, sugar and vanilla. Pour into an ice cream maker, and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. When the ice cream is done freezing, add the bananas and raisins and let them mix in. Transfer to a freezer container, and freeze overnight before serving to improve the texture.
