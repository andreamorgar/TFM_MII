Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brown the sausage in a large skillet over medium heat. Set aside. Make a layer of sliced apples in the bottom of a 2 quart casserole dish. Sprinkle with a bit of the cinnamon. Layer half of the onion, then half of the sauerkraut over the apples. Place all of the sausage slices over the sauerkraut, reserving the drippings in the pan. Cover the sausage with the remaining sauerkraut, onion, and top with apple slices. Sprinkle the remaining cinnamon over the top. Pour the heavy cream and brandy into the skillet with the sausage drippings. Place over medium heat, and stir to remove the bits of sausage flavor from the bottom. Pour over the sausage and apple casserole. Cover, and bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven. Let stand for a few minutes before serving.
