In a Dutch oven, brown ground beef or turkey with chopped onion, stirring frequently. Once beef is browned drain grease from pan. Add canned tomatoes, kidney beans, hominy, taco seasoning and ranch salad dressing mix. Mix well and let simmer over low heat for two hours. (Add 1 to 2 cups of water if necessary to make soup the desired consistency) Ladle into soup bowls and garnish with shredded Cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream, if desired.
