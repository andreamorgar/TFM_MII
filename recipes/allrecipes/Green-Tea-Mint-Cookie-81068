In a medium bowl, mix together the butter and honey until smooth. Empty the contents of the tea bags into the mixture and discard the bags. Mix until well blended. Stir in the egg yolk and peppermint extract. Blend in the flour and baking powder. Divide into 3 sections, wrap in waxed paper or plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). On a floured surface, roll out one portion of the dough at a time to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into 2 inch round shapes using a cookie cutter. Place cookies onto ungreased baking sheets spaced 1 inch apart. Bake for 7 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until the tops are dry, and the edges begin to brown lightly. Transfer to wire racks to cool. Store in an airtight container at room temperature when completely cooled.
