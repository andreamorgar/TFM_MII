Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place butter in an 8-inch square baking dish. Melt butter in the preheating oven, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven. Mix flour, sugar, and milk in a bowl until combined; pour batter over melted butter. Scatter blueberries over batter. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
