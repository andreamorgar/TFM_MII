Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain. Gently stir egg noodles, sour cream, cottage cheese, pineapple with juice, eggs, orange juice, cranberries, melted butter, sugar, applesauce, orange zest, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Spoon the noodle mixture into prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until kugel is set and browned on top, 60 to 75 minutes.
