Place the sugar in a shallow bowl, and set aside. Combine the vanilla wafer crumbs, confectioners' sugar, and pecans in a bowl, and mix well. Place the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl, and microwave on High for 1 to 2 minutes to melt the chips. Stir the melted chips until smooth, and beat in the corn syrup and whiskey. Scrape the chocolate mixture into the crumb mixture, and stir well to mix. Form the dough into 1-inch balls, and roll each ball in sugar. Place the finished bourbon balls on a cooling rack to finish setting up.
