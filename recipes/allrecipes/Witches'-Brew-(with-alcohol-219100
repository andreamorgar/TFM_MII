Fill plastic glove with water, pour in the grenadine, and secure the glove closed with a rubber band. Freeze until solid, 4 to 5 hours. Lightly stir the orange juice, lemon-lime soda, vodka, and champagne together in the cauldron; add the orange sherbet in large scoops. Allow the sherbet to melt and form an orange layer over the punch. Float the peeled grapes on the mixture. Carefully peel the glove from the grenadine ice hand and float the ice hand in the punch to serve.
