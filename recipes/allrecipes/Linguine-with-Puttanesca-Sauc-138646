Stir together all ingredients except linguine in a large bowl. Cook linguine in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water until al dente. Reserve 1 cup cooking water and drain linguine in a colander. Add hot linguine and 1/3 cup pasta cooking water to sauce and toss to coat, adding more water if necessary. Season with salt and pepper.
