Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Mix sugar, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk egg white and water together in a separate bowl until frothy. Toss pecans in the egg white mixture. Mix sugar mixture into pecan mixture until pecans are evenly coated. Spread coated pecans onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 15 minutes, until pecans are evenly browned, 1 hour.
