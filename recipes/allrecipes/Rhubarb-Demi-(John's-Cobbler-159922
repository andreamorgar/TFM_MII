Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and 8 inch square baking dish. Place the rhubarb into the baking dish and sprinkle 3/4 cup of sugar over it. Stir to coat completely. In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, salt and remaining 3/4 cup of sugar. Add the walnuts, egg and sour cream; stir until smooth. Pour over the rhubarb and spread evenly. Bake in the preheated oven until rhubarb is tender and the top is browned, about 40 minutes.
