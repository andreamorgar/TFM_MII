In a large bowl, combine pudding mix and pineapple; mix well. Add marshmallows and 3/4 of the container of dessert topping (add more to get a creamier consistency). Toss in the coconut; mix well. Transfer to a serving dish and top with halved cherries and any extra coconut. Chill for at least an hour before serving. Will be good the next day.
