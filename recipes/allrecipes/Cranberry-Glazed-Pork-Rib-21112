In a small saucepan stir cranberry sauce, cinnamon stick, mustard and orange zest over medium heat for 5 minutes or till bubbly. Set aside. On preheated coals (medium heat) with a drip pan, place ribs on grill. Brush with sauce. Cover and grill for 45 to 60 minutes, brushing occasionally with sauce, until ribs are tender and no pink remains. Heat remaining sauce. Remove and discard cinnamon stick. Serve sauce with ribs.
