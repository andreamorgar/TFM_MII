Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease baking sheets or line with parchment paper. In a large bowl, beat sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Mix in the eggs one at a time. Sift together the matzo cake meal, salt and potato starch. Stir into the batter just until blended. Gently mix in the walnuts and chocolate chips. Chill the dough briefly so it will be easy to handle. Divide the dough into halves and form each half into a 5 inch wide loaf that is about 1 inch thick. Sprinkle cinnamon sugar over the top. Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool, then slice into 1 inch slices to serve.
