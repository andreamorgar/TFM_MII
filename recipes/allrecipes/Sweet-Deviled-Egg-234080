Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water and place in a bowl of ice water. Peel. Slice eggs in half lengthwise. Remove yolks and transfer to a bowl; mash with a fork or pastry blender until yolks resemble powder. Stir mayonnaise, sugar, honey mustard, vinegar, salt, and pepper into yolks until smooth. Spoon yolk mixture into the egg whites and lightly sprinkle with paprika. Chill before serving.
