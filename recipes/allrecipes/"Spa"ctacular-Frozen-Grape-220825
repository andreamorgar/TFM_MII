Remove grapes from stems and place in a colander. Wash thoroughly. Place grapes in a gallon-size resealable bag. Pour sugar into the bag and seal. Gently shake the bag to evenly coat grapes with sugar. Arrange grapes on a paper towel to air-dry any remaining water, about 15 minutes. Place grapes in a single layer on a shallow pan or baking sheet. Freeze for at least 2 hours.
