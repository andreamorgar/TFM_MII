Place kumquat peels in a sauce pan and cover with water; bring to a boil, drain. Cover with water and boil again. Mix sugar and 1/4 cup water in a separate sauce pan and bring to a boil; add peels, lower heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer for 10 minutes. Transfer peels to waxed paper and allow to dry, 8 hours or overnight.
