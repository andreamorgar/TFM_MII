Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place tart shells on a baking sheet. Mash blackberries and lemon zest together lightly in a small bowl. Divide blackberry mixture evenly into the bottom of tart shells. Whisk brown sugar, honey, egg, butter, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl; spoon mixture evenly over blackberries in shells. Bake in the preheated oven until filling is bubbly and shells are golden, 22 to 27 minutes.
