Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a very large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, salt and baking soda; stir into the sugar mixture until well incorporated. Mix in oats, then stir in the chocolate chips, nuts, coconut and raisins. Drop by heaping teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. Let cookies cool for a few minutes on the cookie sheets before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
