Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9-inch pie plate with cooking spray and coat with bread crumbs. Mix eggs, zucchini, biscuit mix, onion, Cheddar cheese, vegetable oil, parsley, Parmesan cheese, garlic, oregano, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl until well blended. Pour mixture into prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown and eggs are set, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Allow quiche to cool for 10 minutes before serving.
