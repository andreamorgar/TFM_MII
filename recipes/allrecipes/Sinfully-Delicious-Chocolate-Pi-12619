In a large bowl, beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Blend in chocolate and vanilla. At medium speed, beat in eggs, one at a time, taking 5 minutes for each egg. (This is very important, 5 minutes for each egg!) Spoon into pie shell and chill. Top with whipped cream before serving, if desired.
