Drain olives well on paper towels. Place Gorgonzola cheese in a pastry bag, or a heavy plastic bag, and squirt into each olive. Whisk together the eggs and milk; place the bread crumbs in a shallow bowl. Dip olives in the egg mixture, shake off the excess, and roll in bread crumbs to coat; set aside. Heat at least 4 inches of oil in a large pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry olives in hot oil until golden brown and drain on paper towels. Allow to cool slightly before serving.
