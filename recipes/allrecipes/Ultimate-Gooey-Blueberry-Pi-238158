Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9-inch pie dish with cooking spray. Mix blueberries and cornstarch together in a bowl until all the blueberries are coated. Add sugar, orange juice, orange zest, vanilla extract, and cinnamon to blueberries; stir until well mixed. Press 1 pie crust into the prepared pie dish. Brush the bottom crust with ½ of the beaten egg white. Pour blueberry mixture into the pie crust. Lay the second crust over the blueberry filling, crimping the 2 crusts together to seal. Cut 4 1/2-inch slits into the top crust. Brush the top crust with the remaining egg wash. Cover crust edges with strips of aluminum foil to prevent burning. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling, 50 to 60 minutes.
