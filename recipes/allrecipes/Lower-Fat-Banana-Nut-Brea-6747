Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly spray two 8x4x2 inch loaf pans with a non-stick cooking spray. Combine the fat free sour cream, egg whites, vanilla, bananas and margarine and mix on medium speed of electric mixer until smooth, creamy and well blended. Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and light brown sugar into the banana mixture. Stir with a spoon until combined. Add more flour if necessary until a thick and rather resistant dough is formed. Fold in the optional nuts and raisins. Mix for 1 minute on the low speed of an electric mixer. Divide dough evenly between the two loaf pans. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) until golden and the center tests done. Remove breads from pans immediately and allow to cool on a rack before slicing.
