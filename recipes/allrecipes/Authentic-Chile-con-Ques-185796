Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion and tomato; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the green chile; cook for 2 minutes then stir in the cheese and milk. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring frequently, until the cheese has melted.
