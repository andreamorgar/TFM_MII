In the bowl of a food processor add the Traditional Basil Pesto and avocado; mix to combine; set aside. In a large pot bring 4 to 6 quarts of water to a rolling boil; add salt to taste and the Farfalle; stir gently. Cook pasta according to package directions; remove from heat and drain well, reserving 1/2 cup pasta cooking water. Return pasta to pot; stir in the baby greens and Traditional Basil Pesto mixture; add pasta water as needed to reach desired consistency. Serve topped with fresh basil leaves and Parmesan, if desired.
