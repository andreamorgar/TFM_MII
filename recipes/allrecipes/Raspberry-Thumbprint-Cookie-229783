Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat butter, vegetable shortening, and brown sugar together in a bowl until smooth and creamy; beat in egg yolks and vanilla extract. Retain egg whites for a later step. Stir flour into butter mixture 1 cup at a time; mix in salt. Beat egg whites in a separate bowl; transfer pecans to a shallow bowl. Pinch off and roll dough into 1-inch balls, dip each in beaten egg white, and roll in pecans. Place cookies on an ungreased baking sheet. Use your thumb to form an indention into the top of each cookie and spoon a small amount of raspberry jam into the hollow. Bake cookies in the preheated oven until very lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes.
