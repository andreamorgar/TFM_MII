Slice the bread in thick slices and place on the rack in the oven. Heat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Check bread periodically throughout following steps and remove from oven when golden. In a saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Cook onion in butter, stirring, until golden, 15 minutes.

Stir in beef broth and simmer 10 minutes, or until onions reach desired consistency. Place slices of bread in ovenproof bowls and top with Swiss cheese. Ladle soup into bowls and top with Parmesan. Place in oven until Parmesan melts. Serve at once.
