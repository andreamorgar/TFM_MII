Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix cake mix, eggs, and vegetable oil together in a bowl until well mixed; fold in chocolate chips. Roll cookie dough into 12 balls and arrange on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned around the edges, 7 to 9 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet 2 to 3 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool.
