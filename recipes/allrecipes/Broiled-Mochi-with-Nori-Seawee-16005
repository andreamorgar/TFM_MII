Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (275 degrees C). Dip mochi into soy sauce, then place on a baking sheet. Let bake for about 5 minutes, or until heated through. While mochi is cooking, cut the dried seaweed into 8 strips. Place these strips in a large frying pan over medium heat. When they are warmed, after approximately 1 to 2 minutes, remove them from the heat. Wrap each mochi cake in seaweed; serve warm.
