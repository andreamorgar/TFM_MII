Place about 1/2 cup strawberry slices into 2 glasses or parfait dishes. Spoon about 1/2 cup yogurt into each glass and top with about 1/4 cup granola. Divide remaining strawberries into glasses and top with banana slices. Place about 1/4 cup blueberries over bananas and top with remaining 1 cup yogurt. Layer remaining 1/2 cup granola over yogurt and drizzle each parfait with honey.
