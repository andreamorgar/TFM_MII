Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in yeast mixture; mix well. Turn onto a floured surface; gently knead for 1 minute. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; roll to 3/4-in. thickness. Cut with a floured 2-1/2-in. round biscuit cutter. Place 2 in. apart on a greased baking sheet. Prick tops with a fork. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to cool on a wire rack. Serve warm.
