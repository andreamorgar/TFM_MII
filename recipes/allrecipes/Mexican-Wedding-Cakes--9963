Cream together confectioner's sugar and butter. Add vanilla, cinnamon and almonds. Knead in flour by hand until completely mixed. Chill dough for about an hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Roll out dough to one inch thickness. Cut into 1 inch pieces, and roll quickly and gently into a ball. Place 2 inches apart on cookie sheets. Bake for about 15 minutes. When baked, dip or roll in confectioner's sugar. Store airtight in layers with waxed paper in between.
