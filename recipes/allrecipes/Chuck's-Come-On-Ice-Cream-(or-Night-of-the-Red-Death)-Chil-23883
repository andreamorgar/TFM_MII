To Marinate: The day before preparing the chili, in a large bowl mix together the sage, thyme, basil, marjoram, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, black pepper and cayenne pepper. Cut beef and pork into 1/2 inch cubes and add to bowl. Mix meat and seasoning together, cover bowl and refrigerate overnight. To Make Chili: Begin to heat tomatoes, tomato sauce, salsa and 2 teaspoons chili powder in a large pot over medium low heat. Meanwhile, heat bacon grease in a large skillet over medium heat. Add jalapeno peppers and saute until soft, 1 to 2 minutes, then add them to large pot. In same skillet fry beef and pork with onion and garlic, in small batches, about 15 to 20 minutes each. As each batch is done add to large pot. When all ingredients are in the large pot, season with salt to taste. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to medium low and simmer for about 3 hours. After eating chili, eat ice cream and say "Come on, ice cream!"
