Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and cool. Cut potatoes in half. Heat a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onions until softened and golden brown, about 20 minutes. Add tarragon; pour in white wine to deglaze pan. Simmer until wine evaporates, 2 to 3 minutes. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels. Mix potatoes, onion, and bacon together in a large bowl. Fold tzatziki sauce, chives, salt, and black pepper into potato mixture.
