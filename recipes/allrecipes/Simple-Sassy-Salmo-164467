Combine the melted butter, vegetable oil, Worcestershire sauce, honey mustard sauce, brown sugar, and garlic powder in a large bowl. Whisk to combine. Reserve 2 tablespoons marinade for basting. Place the salmon in a shallow dish and pour the remaining marinade over. Cover and chill for 45 minutes. Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 5 inches from the heat source. Broil salmon for 12 minutes, brushing occasionally with the reserved marinade. Salmon is done when it is glazed from the marinade and flakes easily with a fork.
