Scrub potatoes (don't peel). If large, cut in half or in quarters. Boil potatoes in their skins until fork-tender. Drain, dry and cut into 1/2 inch cubes. In a salad bowl, combine the potatoes, sour cream, yogurt, and chives; toss gently to coat. Add salt, and pepper to taste; refrigerate until chilled.
