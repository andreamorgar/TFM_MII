Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x9 inch baking dish. In a medium bowl, mix flour, baking powder, butter and sugar. Stir in eggs and milk. In a separate medium bowl, mix cottage cheese, butter, egg, sour cream and salt. Place 1/2 the flour mixture in the baking dish. Cover with the cottage cheese mixture, and top with remaining flour mixture. Bake 50 minutes in the preheated oven, until puffed and golden brown. Allow to cool slightly, and cut into squares to serve.
