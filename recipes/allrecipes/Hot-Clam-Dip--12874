Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine minced clams and lemon juice in a small saucepan. Bring mixture to a simmer. Simmer for 15 minutes. In a medium-size saucepan, combine butter, onion, green bell pepper, parsley, oregano, hot sauce, and red pepper. Stir vegetables over a medium-low heat until butter or margarine is melted. Mix in the clams and breadcrumbs. Pour mixture into an ovenproof baking dish and top with 1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese and sprinkle with paprika. Bake uncovered for 20 minutes.
