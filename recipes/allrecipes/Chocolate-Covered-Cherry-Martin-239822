Fill a cocktail shaker halfway with ice. Pour vodka, chocolate liqueur, Irish cream, and a splash of maraschino cherry juice over ice; cover the shaker and shake until chilled. Drizzle the bottom of a martini glass with chocolate sauce and drop maraschino cherry into the bottom of the glass. Strain shaker contents into prepared glass.
