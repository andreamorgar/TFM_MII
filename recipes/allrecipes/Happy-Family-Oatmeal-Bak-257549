Combine milk, oats, coconut, brown sugar, beaten eggs, golden raisins, chocolate chips, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl; mix well. Pour mixture into a 1.8-quart baking dish. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven until edges are firm and center is still slightly soft, about 45 minutes. Stir before serving.
