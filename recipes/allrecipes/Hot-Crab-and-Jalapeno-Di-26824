Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the red bell pepper. Cook 5 minutes, or until tender. In a medium bowl, mix together red bell pepper, artichoke hearts, mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, green onions, Worcestershire sauce, jalapeno peppers, celery salt, crabmeat and lemon juice. Transfer the mixture to an 8x8 inch baking dish. Sprinkle with almonds. Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until bubbly and lightly browned.
