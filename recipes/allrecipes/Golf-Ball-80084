Mix sugar, peanut butter, butter, coconut, walnuts, and graham cracker crumbs in a large bowl using hands until thoroughly blended. Roll 1 inch balls and place on a baking sheet. Chill for 1 hour in the refrigerator. Melt the chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30 second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave). Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch. Dip peanut butter balls into the chocolate until they are completely coated. Allow chocolate to harden before serving.
