Place the garbanzo beans, tahini, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and red peppers in the bowl of a food processor. Add 2 tablespoons of the reserved juice from the garbanzo beans. Pulse until the mixture is smooth, scraping the sides and blade to mix completely. Cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.
