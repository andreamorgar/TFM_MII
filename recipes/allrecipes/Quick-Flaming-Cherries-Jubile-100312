In a saucepan, stir together the cherry pie filling and brown sugar. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently. When it begins to boil, pour the brandy over the top and do not mix. Carefully touch a lit match to the side of the pan to light a flame. Allow the flame to burn out, then mix the brandy into the cherries. Serve hot over scoops of vanilla ice cream.
