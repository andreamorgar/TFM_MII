Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Place hot dogs on the grill; cook until browned, 5 to 8 minutes, turning once, or until done to suit your taste. Lightly grill hot dog rolls. Meanwhile, place the chile sauce in a small microwave-safe bowl; cook 1 minute. Stir, and cook 1 minute more. Place hot dogs on buns. Top each with chile sauce, onion, and 1 tablespoon mustard, or to taste.
