Place ice cream in the refrigerator until softened to the texture of soft-serve ice cream, 20 to 30 minutes. Combine peaches, lemon juice, and almond extract in a blender. Add 1/2 cup softened ice cream; blend until smooth. Fold blended peach mixture into the remaining 2 1/2 cups softened ice cream, creating a marble effect. Cover and freeze until firm, 30 minutes to 1 hour.
