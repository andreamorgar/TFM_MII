Press pecans into unbaked pie shells. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until light brown. Slice bananas into cooled crusts. Cream sugar and cream cheese together. Add nondairy whipped topping to cream cheese mixture. Pour mixture over bananas in both pie pans. Top pies with blueberries. Chill at least 4 hours before serving, or freeze for later use. Enjoy!
