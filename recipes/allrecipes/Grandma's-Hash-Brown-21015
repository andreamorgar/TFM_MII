In a large saucepan, cover potatoes with water. Bring water to a boil and cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Let cool in refrigerator overnight. The next morning, heat butter in a large skillet or frying pan. Shred potatoes and add to pan. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until golden brown on bottom, flip and brown on other side.
