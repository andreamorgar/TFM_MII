Microwave 1 cup chocolate chips in a small, microwave-safe bowl on high for 1 minute; stir. Cook at additional 10 to 20 second intervals, stirring until smooth. Cool to room temperature. Beat melted chocolate, sour cream, oil and eggs in large mixer bowl. Beat in sugar, flour, baking soda and salt. Dissolve coffee crystals in water; gradually beat into batter. Pour into greased 13 x 9-inch baking pan. Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup chocolate chips and the chopped nuts over the top of the cake. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 40 minutes or until cake tests done.
