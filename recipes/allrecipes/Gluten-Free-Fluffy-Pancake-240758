Preheat a griddle to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Stir milk and vinegar together in a bowl; let sit until the milk 'sours,' about 5 minutes. Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, xanthan gum, baking soda, and salt together in large mixing bowl. Beat eggs and melted butter into soured milk; pour into the flour mixture and stir with a whisk until no lumps remain. Pour batter by the 1/4 cup onto the hot griddle and cook until browned completely, about 3 minutes per side.
