Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line muffins tins with paper muffin liners. Spray with non-stick cooking spray. Whisk flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, ground ginger, and nutmeg together in a mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk eggs, white sugar, and brown sugar together until mixture gets light and foamy, about 2 minutes. Pour in vegetable oil and melted butter; whisk together thoroughly. Add mashed sweet potatoes and chopped pecans. Add dry ingredients. Whisk together until dry ingredients disappear into the batter, about 1 minutes. Let batter set for 10 minutes before filling muffin cups. Fill muffin cups about 3/4 of the way to the top. Sprinkle tops with pecans and a pinch of demerara sugar. Bake until a bamboo skewer inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let cool in pan about 10 minutes; transfer muffins to a cooling rack to cool completely.
