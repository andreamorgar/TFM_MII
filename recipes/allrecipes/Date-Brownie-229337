Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan. Mix graham cracker crumbs with melted butter in a bowl; press into the bottom of the prepared pan to make a pie crust. Beat sweetened condensed milk, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Fold walnuts and dates into the milk mixture with a spatula; pour into prepared pie crust. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes; cut into bars while still warm. Place each square on a cupcake liner to serve.
