In a medium bowl, combine fruit with fruit juice and spices. Cover, and allow to stand overnight. The next day mix together soaked fruits, almonds, cream, and ice cream. Pour mixture into a large mold, and cover with foil. Freeze for at least one week to allow flavour to develop. Unmold by quickly dipping into hot water, and inverting onto serving plate.
