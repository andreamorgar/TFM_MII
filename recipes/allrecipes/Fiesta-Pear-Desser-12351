To Prepare Tortilla Shells: In a deep fryer bring oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place one tortilla in the hot oil gently pressing the center with a wooden spoon or ladle until the tortilla forms a cup. Gently turn and fry each tortilla separately until golden brown on both sides. Combine pears, sugar, cornstarch, 1 teaspoon cinnamon and lemon zest. Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture comes to a boil; cook 1 minute longer. Let mixture cool. Combine cookie crumbs, pecans and remaining cinnamon. Form ice cream into 4 - 6 balls; roll in crumb mixture to coat. Place an ice cream ball in each fried tortilla shell. Top with the cooled pear mixture. Fried tortilla shells can be brushed with honey and dusted with ground cinnamon and sugar before filling, if desired.
