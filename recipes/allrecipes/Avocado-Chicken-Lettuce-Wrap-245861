Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Coat chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle mango and lime seasoning on both sides. Place in a shallow baking dish and cover with aluminum foil. Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven and cool until easily handled, about 10 minutes. Chop chicken into small pieces and place in a large bowl. Add avocado, lime juice, salsa, cilantro, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper; mix well to combine. Serve on top of lettuce leaves to make wraps.
