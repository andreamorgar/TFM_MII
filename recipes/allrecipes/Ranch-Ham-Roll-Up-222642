Beat cream cheese, avocado, and salad dressing mix in a small bowl; stir in onions and bell peppers. Spread 3 tablespoons cream cheese mixture over each tortilla; top each tortilla with two slices ham. Roll tortillas up tightly and wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Unwrap and cut into 3/4-inch slices.
