Whisk together the mayonnaise and half-and-half in a large bowl until smooth, then whisk in the eggs, dill weed, and garlic powder. Set aside. Heat the bacon drippings in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the red bell pepper; cook and stir until the bell pepper begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Stir in the ham and onion. Continue cooking and stirring until the onion is translucent and softened, about 5 minutes more. Pour in the egg mixture. Cook and stir until the eggs are set, about 5 minutes.
