Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place a 1 1/2 to 2 feet long sheet of Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil on a table and place the eggplant and garlic cloves in the center. Drizzle with olive oil and fold up the ends and the outside of the foil to create a foil packet. Put the foil packet on a cookie sheet and bake in the oven for 35 minutes. Transfer the cooked eggplant and garlic cloves to a food processor and add in the cumin, cayenne pepper, lemon juice, tahini and salt and pepper and pulse 7 to 8 times until slightly chunky. Optional Serving: Serve alongside warm pita bread.
