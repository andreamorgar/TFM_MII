Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Beat eggs slightly in medium bowl. Beat in sugar, and then blend in syrup, butter or margarine, vanilla, salt, and pecans. Pour filling into unbaked pie shell. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and continue baking 35 to 40 minutes; the pie will be brown and slightly puffed.
