Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan. In a large bowl, combine toasted coconut, cake mix, and gelatin mix. Make a well in the center and pour in the water, oil and eggs. Beat until smooth. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Pour glaze over cake while still hot. To make the Glaze: in a small bowl, combine confectioners' sugar, orange juice and lemon juice. Stir until smooth.
