Grease and flour a 9 or 10 inch bundt pan. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix together oil, sugar, eggs, pineapples, bananas, pecans, flour, vanilla, soda, cinnamon, and salt. (Optional: adding I cup maraschino cherries to mixture makes a nice fruit cake.) Pour into prepared bundt pan. Bake for about 1 1/2 hours at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
