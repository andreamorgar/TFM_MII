Combine turmeric root, ginger root, and honey together in a bowl, crushing the turmeric and ginger as much as possible. Heat almond milk in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Once small bubbles begin to form around the edges, reduce heat to low. Transfer about 2 tablespoon milk to turmeric mixture to allow mixture to soften and honey to melt into a paste-like mixture. Mix the turmeric paste into milk in the saucepan; raise temperature to medium-low and cook, stirring continuously, until fully combined. Blend with an immersion blender for a smooth texture. Pour turmeric tea into a mug and top with ground turmeric and cinnamon.
