Place the pears into a large saucepan. Fill with enough water to cover the pears by 1 inch. Stir in the sugar and bring to a boil. Cook uncovered until the liquid has reduced into a light syrup, this may take up to 1 hour. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Cool until just warm, then stir in the liqueur and serve.
