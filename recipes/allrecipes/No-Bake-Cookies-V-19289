In a medium saucepan, over medium heat, combine the sugar, salt, butter and milk. Bring to a boil, then boil for 1 full minute. Remove from heat and stir in the peanut butter, oats, vanilla and chocolate drink mix. Drop by spoonfuls onto waxed paper. Let stand until completely cool. Have a wonderful day!!!
