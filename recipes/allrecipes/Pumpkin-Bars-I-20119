Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12x18 inch half sheet pan. In a large bowl, using a wooden spoon, mix together the eggs, oil, sugar and pumpkin until well blended. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and nutmeg; stir into the pumpkin mixture until just blended. Spread evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until bars spring back when lightly touched. Cool before cutting into bars.
