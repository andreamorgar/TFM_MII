Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Mix butter, Worcestershire sauce, seasoned salt, garlic powder, and onion powder in a bowl. Combine rice cereal squares, corn cereal squares, wheat cereal squares, pretzels, goldfish crackers, bagel chips, and peanuts in a bowl. Mix about 1/4 the cereal mixture with 1/4 the butter mixture in a separate bowl until coated; continue adding more cereal mixture and more butter mixture until cereal mixture is fully coated in butter mixture. Pour onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 15 minutes, until butter mixture is baked into cereal mixture, about 1 hour.
