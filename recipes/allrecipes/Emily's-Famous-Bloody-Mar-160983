Run the lemon wedge around the rim of a pint glass and dip in celery salt. Fill with ice cubes and set aside. In a cocktail mixer full of ice, combine the vodka, steak sauce, hot sauce, and vegetable juice. Shake vigorously and strain into the glass. Garnish with green olives, the lemon wedge and a stalk of celery. Season with black pepper and serve immediately.
