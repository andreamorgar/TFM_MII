Beat cream cheese, sour cream, and milk together in a bowl. Stir pudding mix into the cream cheese mixture. Fold about half the cherry pie filling into the cream cheese mixture; spread into the prepared pie crust and top with remaining pie filling. Refrigerate until set and chilled completely, about 2 hours.
