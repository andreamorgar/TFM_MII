Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 x 9 inch casserole dish. In a large bowl combine biscuit mix, oregano, seasoning salt, garlic powder, salt, parsley and Parmesan cheese. Stir in onion, eggs and oil. Mix well and add zucchini. Pour into prepared casserole dish. Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until cooked through and golden brown. Let cool for 5 minutes before slicing.
