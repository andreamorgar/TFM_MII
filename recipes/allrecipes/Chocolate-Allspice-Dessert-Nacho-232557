Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix sugar, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and allspice together in a bowl. Coat both sides of flour tortillas with melted butter; cut tortillas into quarters. Coat 1 side of tortillas with sugar mixture. Arrange tortilla pieces in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and crispy, 12 to 16 minutes. Arrange baked tortilla pieces on a serving platter; drizzle with peanut butter, caramel dip, and chocolate syrup. Top with whipped topping.
