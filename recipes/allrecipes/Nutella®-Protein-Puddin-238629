Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spread hazelnuts onto a baking sheet. Toast hazelnuts in the preheated oven until golden and fragrant, 7 to 12 minutes. Cool nuts completely. Process ricotta cheese, hazelnuts, cocoa powder, stevia, vanilla protein powder, and vanilla extract in a food processor until smooth.
