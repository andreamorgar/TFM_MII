Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat margarine, brown sugar, and white sugar together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth and creamy. Beat first egg into butter mixture. Beat second egg into mixture along with vanilla extract. Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl; stir into creamed margarine mixture until dough is almost white. Fold chocolate chips into dough. Drop small spoonfuls of dough onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes.
