Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Generously season tenderloin with salt and pepper. Set aside. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together mustard, brown sugar and thyme. Place a large sheet of Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil onto a baking sheet. Place onion slices in the center of the foil, in a single layer. Place pork over the onions and brush with 1/2 of the mustard mixture. Bring up foil sides. Double fold top and ends to seal packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until the internal temperature reads 130 degrees F. Remove from oven. Open packet carefully by cutting along top fold with a sharp knife, allowing steam to escape. When uncovered, brush with remaining mustard mixture. Leaving the packet open, broil for about 1 minute or until a nice crust forms on top. Remove from the oven and allow tenderloin to rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving.
