Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, stir together the cream cheese, imitation crab, green onion, garlic, lemon juice, jalapeno and 1 cup shredded cheese. Transfer to an oven safe serving dish, or nice pie plate. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese over the top. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until the edges are boiling and cheese has melted in the center.
