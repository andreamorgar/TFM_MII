Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Combine flour, brown sugar, raisins, coconut, wheat germ, wheat bran, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Whisk vegetable oil and eggs together in a separate bowl. Stir oil mixture, carrots, and beets into flour mixture until just combined. Pour batter into prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until center of cake bounces back when touched, about 1 hour.
