Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt pan. In large mixing bowl, combine spice cake, butterscotch pudding mix, eggs, water and oil. Beat with an electric mixer for 4 minutes. Pour into prepared Bundt pan, and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), for 55 to 60 minutes, or until cake tests done. Allow cake to cool 15 minutes before serving.
