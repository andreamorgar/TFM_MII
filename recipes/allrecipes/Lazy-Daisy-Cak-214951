Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt; set aside. Grease and flour an 8-inch cake pan. Combine the milk, 1 tablespoon butter, and vanilla extract in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then remove from the heat and set aside. Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl with a hand mixer until smooth. Slowly pour in the white sugar while beating on high speed. Stir in the flour mixture until a few large lumps of flour remain, then pour in the warm milk mixture, and continue stirring until smooth. Pour into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. Stir 6 tablespoons butter, brown sugar, coconut, and cream together in a bowl until evenly mixed. Spread over the cooled cake to serve.
