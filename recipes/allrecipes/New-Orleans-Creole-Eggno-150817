Beat the eggs with the white sugar, and light and dark brown sugars in a stand mixer until completely blended. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve into a bowl. Stir in the allspice, mace, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla. Pour the bitters, bourbon, rum, almond-flavored liqueur, and brandy into a large, 4 gallon bowl or food safe bucket. Stir in the egg mixture until thoroughly blended. Pour in the heavy cream and continue stirring. Divide into smaller containers and refrigerate. Shake or stir the containers 2 to 4 times each day for 30 days.
