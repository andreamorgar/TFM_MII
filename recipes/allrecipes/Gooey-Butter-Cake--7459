Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter one 9x13 inch cake pan. Melt the butter slightly. Mix it with 2 of the eggs and cake mix. Pour batter into prepared pan. Mix the remaining 2 eggs with the cream cheese, and the confectioner's sugar. Pour this mixture evenly over the first mixture. Do not stir. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes.
