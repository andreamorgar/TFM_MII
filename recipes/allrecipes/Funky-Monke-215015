Place the hot coffee, banana, condensed milk, chocolate syrup, and protein powder into a blender. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the coffee moving before leaving it on to puree until smooth. Divide ice cubes into 4 large glasses, and pour coffee mixture over the ice.
