Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Spread pecans over a cookie sheet. Bake pecans in preheated oven until toasted, about 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes. Check pecans after 30 minutes. Allow pecans to cool completely. Increase oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk eggs, brown sugar, light corn syrup, flour, butter, white sugar, bourbon, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth. Fold pecan pieces and chocolate chips into the egg mixture until combined; pour into prepared pie crust. Bake in preheated oven until pie is set, 50 to 60 minutes. Serve warm or chilled.
