Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Layer asparagus in the bottom of a medium baking dish. Top with water chestnuts, peas and cream of mushroom soup. Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese. Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Slice bread into 1/4 to 1/2 inch strips, and place in the butter. When butter has been absorbed, layer bread in the baking dish on top of the Cheddar cheese. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake in the preheated oven 35 minutes, or until bubbly and golden brown.
