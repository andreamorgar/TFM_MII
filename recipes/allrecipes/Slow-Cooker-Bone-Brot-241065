Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; spread beef bones out on prepared baking sheet. Roast bones in the preheated oven until browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Place carrots, celery, onion, garlic, peppercorns, and bay leaves in a slow cooker. Place roasted bones over vegetables; pour in enough cold water to cover bones. Add apple cider vinegar and kosher salt. Cook on Low for 8 hours. Pour broth through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl and discard any strained solids.
