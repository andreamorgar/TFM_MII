Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Thoroughly mix beef, pork, lamb, mushrooms, bread crumbs, eggs, garlic, thyme, soy sauce, soup base, parsley, and sage in a large bowl; shape into 2 loaves. Wrap bacon strips around the loaves to cover completely. Place loaves on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the loaves are no longer pink in the center, 90 minutes to 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
