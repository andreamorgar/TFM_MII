Place water in a medium saucepan, and stir in the rice. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes. Remove from heat, cool slightly, and fluff with a fork. In a medium bowl, mix until well combined the plums, onion, habanero peppers, cilantro, and sugar. Cover, and refrigerate about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, season chicken with fresh rosemary, salt, and pepper. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken breasts in hot oil, and brown about 1 minute per side. Reduce heat to medium, and cook chicken about 5 more minutes per side. Serve over rice with plum salsa.
