In a large bowl, combine ground beef with chopped apple, bread crumbs, egg and onion salt. Divide into 18 to 20 meatballs. Roll each one between your hands to shape into a ball. Heat a large skillet and add oil. Cook the meatballs until browned; pour off fat. Stir in water, brown sugar and gravy mix. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes
