Combine dates and walnuts in a food processor; pulse until a loose dough forms. Mix in wheat cereal biscuits until a pliable dough forms. Grease a muffin tin lightly with cooking spray. Line muffin cups with strips of parchment paper. Drop 1 tablespoon of dough into each muffin cup; press over the bottom with your fingers. Freeze until firm, 10 to 15 minutes. Combine soaked cashews, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons coconut milk, maple syrup, coconut oil, and lemon juice in a blender; blend until smooth. Divide cashew mixture evenly among muffin cups. Tap muffin tin against a work surface to release any air bubbles in the cashew mixture. Cover with plastic wrap. Freeze until firm, 4 to 6 hours. Pull cheesecakes out of muffin cups using the parchment paper ends. Drizzle caramel sauce and peanut butter on top; garnish with blueberries.
