Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in kluski noodles and return to a boil. Cook kluski noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender but still slightly firm, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain well and set noodles aside. Place chopped bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until evenly browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Cook and stir cabbage and onion into the bacon and drippings until the cabbage is wilted and tender, about 10 minutes. Gently mix the cooked kluski noodles into cabbage mixture; season with hot sauce.
