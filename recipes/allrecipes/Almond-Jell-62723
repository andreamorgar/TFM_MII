Pour 1 cup water in a bowl; sprinkle the gelatin over the water; stir until the gelatin is partially dissolved. Set aside. Bring 1 cup water to a boil in a large saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low and slowly pour in the gelatin mixture. Add the milk, sugar, and almond extract; stir until the sugar and gelatin are completely dissolved; pour mixture into a large, shallow container. Refrigerate until firm, 3 to 4 hours. Cut into small squares to serve.
