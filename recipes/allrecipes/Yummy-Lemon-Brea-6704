Generously grease a 9 x 5 inch loaf pan. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine melted butter or margarine and sugar. Add eggs, and mix until light and fluffy. Add milk, baking powder, lemon rind, and chopped nuts. Mix well. Sift flour, and gradually add to mixture; mix to just combine. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until tester inserted in the center comes out clean. While bread is baking, combine lemon juice and confectioners' sugar in small dish. Stir well before using. Immediately upon removing bread from oven, place pan on a cooling rack. Using a large fork, poke holes all over the bread. Pour lemon juice mixture over the top of the bread. Cool for 15 minutes, and then remove from pan.
