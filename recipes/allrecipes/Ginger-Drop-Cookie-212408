Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon and cloves in a medium bowl; set aside. Beat butter, Stevia in the Raw, and 1/4 cup Sugar in the Raw in a large bowl with mixer at medium high speed until well mixed. Beat in egg and corn syrup until smooth. Stir in flour mixture. Refrigerate dough 1 to 2 hours or until easy to handle. (See TIP below.) Place 1/3 to 1/2 cup Sugar in the Raw in a small dish. Shape dough into 3/4-inch balls; roll in sugar. Place balls 2 inches apart on greased cookie sheets. Bake 7 to 10 minutes or just until edges begin to brown. (Do not overbake or cookies will be dry.) Cool 1 minute on baking sheet, then remove to wire racks to finish cooling.
