Spray the bottom of the inside of a slow cooker crock with cooking spray to coat. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Spread hash-brown potatoes into the bottom of the slow cooker crock to cover. Top with cooked sausage. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over the sausage and stir. Beat eggs in a large bowl until smooth; add milk and beat to integrate. Stir mustard, salt, and pepper into the egg mixture; stream over the potato mixture. Cook on Low for 6 to 8 hours.
