Preheat broiler. Cut cheese into 1/2-inch-thick slices and divide evenly among 4 small flameproof baking dishes (or arrange in 1 layer in a large one). Sprinkle oregano and pepper over cheese. Stir together roasted peppers, olives, and oil in a small bowl, then spoon mixture over and around cheese. Broil 2 to 4 inches from heat until edges of cheese are golden, about 5 minutes.
