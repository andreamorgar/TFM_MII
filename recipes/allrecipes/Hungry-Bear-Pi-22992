Reserve one pinch of gelatin. Combine most of gelatin with applesauce. On a serving platter, place 4 graham cracker sheets, long edges together, in a single layer. Spread 1/2 cup of applesauce mixture over crackers. Repeat layers until all crackers and applesauce are used. Frost with whipped topping. Sprinkle reserved gelatin over top of cake. Chill in refrigerator 6 hours or overnight before serving. Cut crosswise like a loaf of bread to serve.
