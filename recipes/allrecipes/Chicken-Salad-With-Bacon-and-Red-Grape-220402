Cook bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate and allow to cool; crumble. Mix cooked chicken, crumbled bacon, water chestnuts, celery, and red grapes in a large salad bowl. Whisk mayonnaise, dried parsley, lime juice, onion powder, ground ginger, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and black pepper together to make a smooth dressing. Pour dressing over chicken mixture and stir to coat. Cover the bowl and refrigerate until cold, at least 30 minutes.
