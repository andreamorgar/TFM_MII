Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir potatoes into hot oil to coat; season with garlic powder and onion powder. Place a cover on the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are browned and tender, about 15 minutes. Drain excess oil. Mash braunschweiger into the potato mixture. Cook and stir until the braunschweiger is hot and slightly crisp, about 5 minutes.. Season with salt and pepper to serve.
