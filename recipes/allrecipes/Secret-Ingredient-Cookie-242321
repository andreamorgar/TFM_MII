Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat white sugar, brown sugar, and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat ice cream, egg, and vanilla extract into butter mixture until smooth. Whisk flour, malt powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Add flour mixture to butter mixture and stir until just combined. Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned, about 8 minutes.
