Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine rhubarb, raspberries, white sugar, orange juice, cornstarch, and cinnamon together in a casserole dish; cover with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir macadamia nuts until toasted and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Combine macadamia nuts, flour, oats, butter, brown sugar, and dark chocolate in a food processor; pulse until crumbly. Remove aluminum foil from casserole dish and stir rhubarb mixture; top with oat mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until rhubarb is soft and top is lightly browned, about 45 minutes.
