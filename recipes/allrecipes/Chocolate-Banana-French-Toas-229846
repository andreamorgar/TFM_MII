Whisk eggs in a large bowl until well blended. Whisk in chocolate milk and bananas. Dip bread slices into egg mixture; let soak briefly to coat both sides. Remove bread, letting excess egg mixture drip back into bowl, and place in a large lightly buttered or oiled frying pan over medium heat. Cook bread for a few minutes on both sides until golden brown. Serve topped with bananas and strawberries, if desired, and drizzled with syrup. Or, spread with jam.
