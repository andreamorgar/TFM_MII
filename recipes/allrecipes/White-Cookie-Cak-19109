Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan. In a large bowl cream the margarine and sugar. Beat in eggs one at a time. Mix in the crushed cookies, and coconut alternately with the milk. Stir in the applesauce. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until the top springs back when lightly touched.
