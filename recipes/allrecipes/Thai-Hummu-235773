Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant and lightly browned, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Pour mixture into a ramekin or small bowl and cool. Blend cooled garlic-oil mixture, garbanzo beans, lime juice, peanut butter, coconut milk, chili sauce, lemon grass, basil, ginger, curry paste, jalapeno pepper, salt, cayenne pepper, and chili powder together in a blender until smooth.
