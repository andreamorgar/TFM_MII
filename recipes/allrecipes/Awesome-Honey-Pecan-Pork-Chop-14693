In a shallow dish, mix together flour, salt and pepper. Dredge pork cutlets in the flour mixture. In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add chops, and brown both sides. Transfer to a warm plate. Mix honey and pecans into the pan drippings. Heat through, stirring constantly. Pour sauce over cutlets.
