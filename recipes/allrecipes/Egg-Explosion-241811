Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 13x9-inch baking dish. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Beat eggs with sour cream in a large bowl until smooth; pour into prepared baking dish. Bake eggs in preheated oven until set, about 15 minutes. Spread layers of sausage, green chiles, salsa, Cheddar cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, and jalapeno slices, respectively, over the baked eggs. Bake casserole until the cheese melts completely and the layers are hot in the middle, 20 to 25 minutes. Arrange avocado slices over the top of the casserole.
