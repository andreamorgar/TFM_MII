Sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Set aside. In a large bowl, cream together 1/2 cup butter and 1 1/2 cup sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk. Fold in the rhubarb mixture. Stir in the coconut and chopped almonds. Pour batter into prepared pan. To make streusel topping: In a small bowl, combine 4 tablespoons flour and 4 tablespoons brown sugar. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
