Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Beat butter, brown sugar, white sugar, tahini, honey, and ground cinnamon together in a separate large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add eggs; mix well. Beat flour mixture in gradually until dough is just combined. Stir in coconut, oats, and almonds. Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until edges are golden, 9 to 11minutes. Cool on baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
