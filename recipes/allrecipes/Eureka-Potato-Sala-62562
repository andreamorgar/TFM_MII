Place the potatoes into a large pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook for about 10 minutes, or until easily pierced with a fork. Drain, and set aside to cool. In a serving bowl, mix together the sour cream, salad dressing, shredded cheese and hard-cooked eggs. When the potatoes are cool, stir into the dressing. If you like it creamier, mix longer. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
