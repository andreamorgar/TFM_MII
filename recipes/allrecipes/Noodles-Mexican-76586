In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef, onion, and garlic until beef is evenly brown. Drain. Mix the corn, olives, tomatoes, chili beans, and green onions into the skillet. Season with taco seasoning and salt. Cover, and cook 15 minutes. Mix the egg noodles into the skillet. Cover, and continue cooking 12 minutes, or until egg noodles are tender. Top each serving with a dollop of sour cream.
