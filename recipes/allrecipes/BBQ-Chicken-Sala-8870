Preheat grill for high heat. Lightly oil grate. Grill chicken 10 minutes on each side, or until juices run clear. Remove from heat, cool, and cube. In a large bowl, toss together the chicken, celery, red bell pepper, onion, and corn. In a small bowl, mix together the barbeque sauce and mayonnaise. Pour over the chicken and veggies. Stir, and chill until ready to serve.
