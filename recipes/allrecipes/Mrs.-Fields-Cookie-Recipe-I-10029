Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Cream together butter or margarine, white sugar, and brown sugar. Add eggs and vanilla. Mix together in a separate bowl: salt, baking powder, baking soda, flour and oatmeal (put small amounts of oatmeal in blender until it turns to powder. Measure out 5 cups of oatmeal and only "powderize" that, NOT 5 cups "powderized" oatmeal). Mix all of the above. Add: chocolate chips, grated chocolate bar, and chopped nuts (any kind). Bake on greased cookie sheet (make golf ball sized balls) and bake about two inches apart. Bake for 8 -10 minutes. Do not overbake.
