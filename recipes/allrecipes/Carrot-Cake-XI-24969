Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Sift together the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. Set aside. In a large bowl, beat eggs, sugar and oil until smooth. Beat in flour mixture. Stir in pureed carrots, pineapple, walnuts and coconut. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
