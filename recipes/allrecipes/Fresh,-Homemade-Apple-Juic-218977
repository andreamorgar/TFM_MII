Place the peelings and cores into a saucepan, and stir in the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the water picks up the apple flavor and color, about 30 minutes. Drain the apple juice, discarding solid pieces, and stir in the sugar until dissolved. Allow to cool before drinking.
