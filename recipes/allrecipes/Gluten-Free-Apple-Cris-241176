Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine apples, 1/4 cup rice flour, white sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl; transfer to an 8-inch baking dish. Mix brown sugar, butter, 1/2 cup rice flour, quinoa flakes, and rice flakes in the same bowl used for apple mixture. Sprinkle crumble topping over apple mixture and pat down gently. Bake in the preheated oven until apples are tender and topping is slightly browned, 35 minutes.
