Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly spray a large, deep casserole dish with cooking spray. Cook pasta according to package instructions. While pasta cooks, melt butter in large, heavy-bottomed skillet; add onions and saute for 5 minutes. Add ground beef and cook until no longer pink. Add salt, tomatoes, chili seasoning, and Ragu(R) Old World Style(R) Traditional sauce. Stir to combine and cook over medium-low heat for 5 minutes or until ready to add to pasta. Drain pasta and return to pot. Stir in corn and 1 1/2 cups of cheese; mix until evenly combined. Stir in the chili. Pour into the casserole dish and top with remaining cheese. Bake until hot and bubbling, about 15 minutes. Top with cilantro before serving.
