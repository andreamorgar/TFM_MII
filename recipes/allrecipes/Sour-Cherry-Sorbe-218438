Place the cherries into the work bowl of a food processor, and process until pureed, about 1 minute. Add sugar, white wine, almond extract, and salt to the pureed cherries, and process again to mix well, about 30 seconds. Pour the mixture into a 6-cup freezer container with a flat bottom. Cover the sorbet, and freeze until partially frozen, 3 to 4 hours. Stir and scrape the frozen sorbet into the soft part of the sorbet to mix well; cover and freeze 2 to 3 more hours. Repeat stirring and scraping, cover again, and freeze overnight.
