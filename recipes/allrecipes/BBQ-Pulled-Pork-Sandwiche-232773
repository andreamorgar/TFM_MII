Heat oil over medium-high heat in a very large skillet. Brown pork in hot oil on all sides. [Cleaning tip: Once the stove top is cool, wipe up any oil splatters with Clorox(R) Disinfecting Wipes*. Rinse hands once complete.] Place browned pork and onions in a 5- to 6-quart slow cooker. Combine tomato sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, the 1/2 teaspoon salt, cayenne pepper, and black pepper in a medium bowl. Pour over pork and onions. Cover and cook on low for 10 to 12 hours or on high for 5 to 6 hours. Transfer pork to a cutting board; reserving cooking juices and onions. When cool enough to handle, cut pork off bones and coarsely chop. Combine pork, onions, and as much of the juices as desired to moisten in a bowl. Serve pork on buns with Creamy Coleslaw. For Creamy Coleslaw: Combine mayonnaise, sour cream, vinegar, sugar, celery seed, and the 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Stir in cabbage and carrot. Cover and chill for at least 2 hours before serving. Store in the refrigerator up to 24 hours. Stir before serving. Makes 3 1/2 cups.
