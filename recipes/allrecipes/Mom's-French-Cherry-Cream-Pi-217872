In a small bowl, combine cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and almond extracts. Beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. In a separate medium bowl, beat whipping cream until stiff. Carefully fold cream cheese mixture into whipped cream. Spread beaten mixture in the bottom of pie crust. Cover with cherry pie filling. Refrigerate pie until set and cold, about 30 minutes.
