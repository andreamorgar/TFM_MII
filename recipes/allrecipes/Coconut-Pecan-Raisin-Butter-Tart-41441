Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place tart shells on a baking sheet. Beat brown sugar, corn syrup, and butter together in a bowl until creamy; beat in egg just until combined. Stir in pecans, raisins, coconut, vinegar, and salt; divide mixture evenly into tart shells. Bake in the preheated oven until filling is bubbly and crust is golden, about 20 minutes.
