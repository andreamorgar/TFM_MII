Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix 1/4 cup tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, spicy mustard, and honey together in a bowl; set aside. Mix thoroughly ground beef, ground turkey, ground lamb, 2 1/4 cup tomato sauce, oats, egg, sweet onion, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; divide into halves and form 2 loaves. Put loaves into loaf pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, brush tops with sauce, and continue baking until no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Cool slightly in pans before serving.
