Beat together the cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Beat in the whipped topping until well mixed. Spread about half of the cream cheese mixture into the graham cracker crust. Spread the strawberry preserves in an even layer over the cream cheese mixture. Top the preserves with the remaining half of the cream cheese filling. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.
