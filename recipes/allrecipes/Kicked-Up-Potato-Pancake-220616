Combine potatoes, ham, eggs, mozzarella cheese, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat. Pour enough olive oil to cover bottom of pan. Scoop up about 1/2 cup of potato mixture per pancake and form into a patty. Repeat, making 8 patties in all. Place 4 pancakes at time in hot olive oil. Cook until browned, about 4 minutes on each side. Transfer to paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle with green onion and Parmesan cheese.
