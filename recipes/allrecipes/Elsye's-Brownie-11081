Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with 1 inch sides. Mix together 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup butter or margarine, eggs, chocolate syrup, and flour. Spread batter into prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the pan. Combine 6 tablespoons butter or margarine, milk, and 1 1/4 cups sugar in a saucepan. Stir and boil for 3 minutes. Add 1 Cup chocolate chips, and stir over low heat until melted. Frost cooled brownies immediately so frosting does not cool and harden. Cut into bars.
