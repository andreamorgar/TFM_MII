Cut meat into 8 slices. Cook in a large skillet until browned on both sides. Remove from skillet, and keep warm. In a shallow dish, beat eggs and milk together. Dip bread quickly in egg mixture, coating both sides. Fry two at a time in skillet until done on both sides. Wrap one piece of meat with one slice of French toast.
