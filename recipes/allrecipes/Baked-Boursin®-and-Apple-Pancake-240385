Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a pie plate with cooking spray. Blend milk, flour, eggs, and salt together in a blender or food processor until batter is smooth. Melt butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir apple in hot butter until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir lemon juice and sugar into apples until sugar dissolves; pour apple mixture into prepared pie plate. Top with crumbled cheese spread and pour batter over apples and cheese into pie plate. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and set, about 25 minutes.
