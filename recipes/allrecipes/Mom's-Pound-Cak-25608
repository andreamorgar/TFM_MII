Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and confectioners' sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the orange juice, vanilla and salt. Beat in the flour. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 70 to 80 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
