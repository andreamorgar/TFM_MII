Heat a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add ground beef, and cook until evenly browned. Stir occasionally to crumble. Season the beef with chili powder, onion flakes, cumin, paprika, garlic and red pepper flakes, and mix well. Pour in the tomatoes, chili beans, and tomato sauce. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for at least 30 minutes, or longer for thicker chili. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
