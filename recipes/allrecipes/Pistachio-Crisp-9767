Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Cream together the butter and salt while slowly adding the powdered sugar. Add the nuts, vanilla and flour and mix until well blended. On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough in the shape of logs about 1/2 inch in diameter. Cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces and bake for 15 to 18 minutes. Roll cookies in powdered sugar when they are still warm. Let cool on wire racks.
