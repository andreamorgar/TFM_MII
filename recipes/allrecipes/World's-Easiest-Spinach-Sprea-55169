Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Wrap garlic cloves in aluminum foil, and bake for 45 minutes, or until soft. Bring 3 inches of water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add spinach, cover, and cook for about 2 minutes, just until wilted and soggy. Remove from heat and drain. Mix the garlic, spinach, olive oil, and Romano cheese. In small batches, use a food processor to process to your desired consistency. Transfer to a serving dish.
