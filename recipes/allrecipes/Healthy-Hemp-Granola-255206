Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a large rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil; grease with cooking spray. Mix oats, almonds, hemp seeds, and flaxseed meal together in a large bowl. Whisk honey, water, flaxseed oil, vanilla extract, and almond extract together in a bowl until blended. Pour over oat mixture and stir quickly until distributed. Spread evenly on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 3 to 5 minutes, until oats are golden and nuts appear toasted, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely, about 20 minutes.
