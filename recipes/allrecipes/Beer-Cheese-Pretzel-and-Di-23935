Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix the hot bread roll mix with yeast and Cheddar cheese. In a microwave or small saucepan, heat the beer to almost boiling. Stir beer and egg into the flour mixture and knead 5 minutes. Allow the dough to rest 5 minutes, then roll into desired shape. Sprinkle with kosher salt. Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. In a food processor, blend the cream cheese, processed cheese, garlic powder and room temperature beer. Refrigerate until serving with the baked dough.
