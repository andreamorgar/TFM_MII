Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine oats, flour, coconut, fruit bits, brown sugar, cinnamon and baking soda in large mixing bowl. In separate bowl, mix together melted butter, applesauce and egg. Stir applesauce mixture into dry ingredients until just combined. Spread mixture into lightly greased 9 x 13-inch baking pan. Bake 20-25 minutes, until lightly browned. Remove from oven and cool before cutting into squares or bars.
