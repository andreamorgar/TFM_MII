Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl mix together zwieback crumbs and white sugar. Stir in butter or margarine. Mix well and pat mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake in preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until lightly browned. Set aside and allow to cool. In a large mixing bowl, whip cream cheese until fluffy. Add confectioners' sugar and beat until smooth. Fold in whipped topping and marshmallows. Spread mixture evenly onto cooled crust. Boil water in a medium saucepan. Remove from heat and add gelatin. Mix until dissolved, then stir in partially frozen strawberries. Pour mixture over cream cheese layer. Chill until very firm.
