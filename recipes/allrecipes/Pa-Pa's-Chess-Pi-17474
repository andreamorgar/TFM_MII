Mix in flour, then 1/2 cup milk. Add egg yolks, vanilla extract, and lemon extract. Mix until smooth, then stir in the remaining 1 cup milk. Gently fold egg whites into milk mixture. Pour half of mixture into each pastry shell. Bake in preheated oven for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and bake an additional 35 to 40 minutes, until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.
