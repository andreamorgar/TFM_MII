In 2 quart saucepan, sift and mix together flour, cocoa, 2/3 cup sugar and salt. Whisk in milk. Over medium heat, and stirring constantly, cook until it reaches pudding thickness. Remove from heat. Very quickly beat in egg yolks, 1 teaspoon vanilla and butter; beating briskly until completely mixed and smooth. Cool in pan. Pour into baked, cooled pie shell. Top with meringue. Meringue: chill beaters and bowl. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). With electric mixer on high, beat 3 egg whites and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to stiff peaks. While still beating egg whites, add 10 tablespoons sugar, one tablespoon at a time. Spread meringue over pie, and bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 12 minutes or until meringue turns pale brown. Remove from oven. Place on level, draft-free area at least 30 minutes to cool before serving.
