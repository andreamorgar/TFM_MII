Cook peas in a saucepan of boiling salted water just until they turn a brighter shade of green, about 30 seconds. Drain in a colander and rinse under cold water to stop cooking. Cut halved cucumber and radishes crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Toss peas, cucumber, radishes, and sesame seeds with vinegars and season with salt and pepper.
