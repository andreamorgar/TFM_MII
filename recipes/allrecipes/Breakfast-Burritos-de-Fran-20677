Pour the drained can of black beans into a small saucepan and cook over medium-low until heated through. While the beans are heating, heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet. In a large bowl, scramble the eggs together. Pour the eggs into the hot skillet and scramble until cooked to desired wetness. Heat the tortillas in a microwave or in the oven until soft. Lay the tortillas flat and spoon as many black beans onto each tortilla as you like. Follow with eggs, cheese and salsa. Roll the tortillas into burritos. Serve or let cool and freeze for reheating and eating another morning.
