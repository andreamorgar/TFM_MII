In a saucepan over medium heat, combine water, sugar, vanilla and ground coffee. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Allow to cool, then remove grounds through a strainer. When cool, stir in vodka. Pour into a liquor bottle, and keep in a cool place.
