Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9 inch pans. In a large bowl, stir together cake mix and cocoa. Make a well in the center and pour in water, mayonnaise and eggs. Beat on low speed until blended. Scrape bowl, and beat 2 minutes on medium speed. Stir in chopped nuts and cherries. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
