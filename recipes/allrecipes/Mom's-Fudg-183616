Combine the chocolate chips, milk, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth. Line a 9-inch square baking dish with waxed paper; pour the fudge into the dish and smooth into an even layer. Allow to cool until firm, about 2 hours. Cut into squares; store wrapped in plastic or in a sealable container in the refrigerator.
