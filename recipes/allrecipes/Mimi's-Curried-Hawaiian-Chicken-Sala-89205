Place chicken in a large pot of lightly salted water, and bring to a boil; simmer until tender and cooked through, about 25 minutes. Drain, set aside. When cool enough to handle, chop coarsely, and place into a large bowl. In a separate bowl, stir together mayonnaise, curry powder, lemon juice, and soy sauce. Stir into the chopped chicken 2 1/4 cups of the toasted almonds. Stir in grapes, celery, water chestnuts, and pineapple. Gently fold in all but 1/2 cup of the dressing. Cover, and refrigerate salad and reserved dressing for several hours (or overnight). Before serving, adjust dressing to taste, and garnish with paprika and remaining 1/4 cup almonds.
