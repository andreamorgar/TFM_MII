Bring 5 cups of water and the sugar to a boil in a saucepan, then remove from the heat and add the tea bags. Allow tea to steep while you mix the lemonade concentrate and remaining water in a large pitcher. Pour the tea mixture into the lemonade, discarding tea bags. Stir and refrigerate until cold before serving.
