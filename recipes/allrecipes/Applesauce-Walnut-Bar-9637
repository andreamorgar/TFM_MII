Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 13x9 inch baking pan. Melt chocolate in the microwave or in a bowl over a pan of simmering water. Stir frequently until smooth. Remove from heat, and let cool. Cream together the shortening and sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, stirring constantly until well blended. In a separate bowl, mix together applesauce, melted chocolate and vanilla. Add to the egg mixture, stirring until smooth. Combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt; gradually stir into the batter. Fold in chopped walnuts. Spread evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle of cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan before cutting.
