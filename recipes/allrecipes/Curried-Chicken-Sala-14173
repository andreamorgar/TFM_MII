Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Crumble and set aside. In a large bowl, combine bacon, chicken, celery, and grapes. Prepare the dressing in a small bowl by whisking together the mayonnaise, onion, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, curry and salt and pepper. Pour over salad and toss well.
