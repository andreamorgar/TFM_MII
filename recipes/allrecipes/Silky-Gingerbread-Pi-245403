Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Press pie crust into a 9-inch pie pan and prick bottom and sides with a fork. Bake crust in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Set a fine-mesh sieve over a bowl. Whisk brown sugar, white sugar, cornstarch, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, salt, and allspice together in a saucepan; gradually whisk in half-and-half and molasses until smooth. Whisk egg yolks into molasses mixture. Cook molasses mixture, whisking constantly, over medium heat until large bubbles appear on surface, about 7 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook, whisking constantly, for 1 minute more. Remove saucepan from heat and pour filling through sieve. Whisk butter into filling until smooth. Pour filling into pie crust, place a sheet of plastic wrap directly on surface of filling, and refrigerate until set, about 3 hours. Lightly beat cream in a bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Top each pie slice with a heaping tablespoon of whipped cream.
