Heat grill to medium-high. Cut peaches in half; remove pits. Brush cut sides with oil. Place cut-sides down on grill. Grill 3 to 4 minutes until grill marks appear. Brush tops with oil, turn over and move to indirect heat. Grill about 10 minutes longer until warm and tender. Serve warm peach halves topped with ice cream.
