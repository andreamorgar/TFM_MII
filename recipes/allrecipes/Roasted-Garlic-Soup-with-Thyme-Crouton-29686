Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat the heads of garlic with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and place them in a baking dish or on a cookie sheet. Bake for about 40 minutes, or until golden brown. While the garlic is roasting, stir together 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 tablespoon of thyme, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Add the bread cubes, and stir to coat. Spread the cubes out on a baking sheet. Bake for about 10 minutes in the oven with the garlic, or until golden brown. Stir occasionally for even toasting. Once the garlic is roasted, cut the heads in half horizontally, so that all of the cloves are exposed. Squeeze both halves to release the roasted cloves into a medium bowl. Pick out any pieces of skin that fall in. In a large saucepan, combine the roasted garlic, milk, cream and thyme. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer for 10 minutes, then puree in a blender. Strain through a sieve back into the pan. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls, and top with croutons to serve.
