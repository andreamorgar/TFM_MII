Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large bowl, cream together the shortening, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg and vanilla until well blended. Combine the oats, flour, baking powder and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Mix in the candy-coated chocolate pieces. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until light golden brown.
