In a stock pot, combine the wine, juice cocktail, garlic and pepper flakes. Bring to a boil and add mussels. Cover and continue to boil for about 4 to 6 minutes or until all the mussels have opened. Discard any mussels that haven't opened. Remove mussels from liquid and keep warm. Pour off liquid to leave about 1 cup. Try not to discard the garlic. Boil the 1 cup of liquid until it's reduced to about 3/4 of a cup. Add butter and stir until butter has melted and sauce has thickened slightly. Serve mussels with sauce.
