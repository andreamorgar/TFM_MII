Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly coat 12 (2/6.5 cm) non-stick muffin pan cups with cooking spray. In medium bowl, combine cereal and milk. Let stand for about 2 minutes or until cereal softens. In large bowl, combine flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside. Add egg, oil and mashed bananas to cereal mixture; beat well. Add liquid mixture to dry ingredients, stirring only until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips. Portion batter evenly into prepared muffin cups. Top each cup with a reserved banana slice. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes or until tops spring back when lightly touched.
