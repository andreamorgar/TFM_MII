Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets with cooking spray. Make a lengthwise cut partway through the middle of each sweet potato. Cut potatoes into coins using the slicer attachment on a spiralizer. Arrange coins on the baking sheets. Spray with cooking spray. Season both sides with seasoned salt. Bake in the preheated oven until edges start to curl, 20 to 25 minutes. Season with more salt. Let cool until crisp, about 10 minutes.
