Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan. Whisk vegetable oil, white sugar, eggs, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth. Combine flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Stir oil mixture into flour mixture until a well-mixed batter forms. Fold carrots, pineapple, coconut, and walnuts into batter; pour into prepared baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour; cool completely, about 1 hour. Whisk confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, butter, and a dash vanilla extract together in a bowl until well blended; spread over cooled cake.
