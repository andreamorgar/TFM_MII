Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8 inch baking pan. In a medium bowl, stir together the egg, brown sugar and vanilla until just blended. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt, quickly stir into the egg mixture. Fold in the coconut and raisins, then spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until bars are golden brown. Cool and cut into squares.
