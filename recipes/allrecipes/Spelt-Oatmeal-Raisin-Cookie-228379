Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix spelt flour, salt, cinnamon, and baking soda together in a bowl. Mix banana, brown sugar, shortening, applesauce, egg, and maple syrup together in a separate bowl; add to flour mixture. Stir to combine. Fold in oats and raisins. Drop tablespoonfuls of batter onto an ungreased baking sheet. Bake cookies in the preheated oven until the edges are light brown, about 12 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack.
