Place the strawberries in a bowl with the sparkling wine and let marinate at least 20 minutes. Drain the strawberries, reserving the sparkling wine. Set aside 1/2 cup of strawberries for a garnish. Meanwhile, combine the cream cheese, white chocolate, orange zest, and orange juice in a separate bowl; stir and blend until smooth. Spread 4 slices of raisin bread with the cream cheese mixture. Arrange the drained strawberries over the cream cheese. Top with remaining 4 slices of raisin bread to make a sandwich. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place the sandwiches in the skillet; cook until lightly toasted on each side, about 2 minutes per side. Place the toasted sandwiches on serving plates, and cut in half. Drizzle evenly with maple syrup, and garnish with remaining strawberries. Serve with the reserved sparkling wine.
