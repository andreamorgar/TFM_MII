Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Coat the inside of spaghetti squash with olive oil and place, cut-side down, onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until squash is tender and a fork can easily puncture the flesh, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove baking sheet from oven and cool squash until easily handled, about 15 minutes. Heat coconut oil in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir asparagus until tender yet firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Shred the squash flesh using a fork to create long strands that resemble noodles. Mix squash and basil into asparagus, adding more coconut oil if too dry; cook and stir for 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat and mix tomatoes and pine nuts into squash mixture.
