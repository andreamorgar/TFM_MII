Over medium heat in a medium saucepan, heat butter and garlic. Place the snails in the saucepan and slowly cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Remove and discard mushroom stems. Fill the mushroom caps with 1/2 teaspoon melted butter with garlic from the saucepan. Microwave 2 to 3 minutes. Insert the snails in the mushroom caps. Microwave another 3 minutes.
