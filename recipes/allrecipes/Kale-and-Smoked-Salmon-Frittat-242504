Heat butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat; cook and stir kale, about 2 minutes. Add water and cover skillet; cook, stirring frequently, until kale is wilted, about 5 minutes. Remove lid and cook, stirring frequently, until water is evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix potatoes, salmon, and capers into kale; cook and stir until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Pour eggs over kale-salmon mixture; cook, stirring gently and scraping the bottom of the skillet to prevent sticking, until barely set, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle feta cheese over egg mixture. Broil in the preheated oven until top is browned and eggs are set and puffed, about 5 minutes. Allow frittata to sit in skillet for a few minutes before serving.
