Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat; gently cook and stir rice in the hot oil until toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Add coconut milk, water, sugar, and salt; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover saucepan, and simmer until rice is tender and has absorbed all the liquid, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir coconut cream into rice. Scoop rice into a serving bowl and top with mango.
