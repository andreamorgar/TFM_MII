Spread butter on both sides of each pound cake slice. Heat a griddle over medium heat. Cook cakes slices on hot griddle, turning once, until golden brown on each side, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer cake slices to a wire rack to cool completely. Stir frosting, yellow food coloring, and red food coloring together in a bowl until frosting is the color of American cheese. Spread frosting on 1 side of half of the pound cake slices and top with another slice of pound cake.
