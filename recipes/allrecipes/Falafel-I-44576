Place split peas in a large bowl, and cover with water (roughly twice as much water as split peas by volume). Cover, and refrigerate for 24 hours. Drain the water from the peas, and mash the peas thoroughly. Mix in onion, garlic, mint, egg, coriander, and cumin. Season with cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper to taste. Cover, and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. Heat oil in a deep fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Form split pea mixture into small rounds, flatten slightly, and drop into hot oil. Fry until the falafel are a rich brown color.
