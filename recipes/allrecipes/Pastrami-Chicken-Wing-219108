Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicon mat. Combine the chicken wings, vegetable oil, white pepper, black pepper, coriander, paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt in a large mixing bowl; toss with a spatula to coat evenly. Sprinkle with flour; toss again to coat evenly. Bake in the preheated oven until browned on top, about 25 minutes. Turn the wings and return to oven to bake until crisp, no longer pink in the center, and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes more. Remove immediately to a serving dish.
