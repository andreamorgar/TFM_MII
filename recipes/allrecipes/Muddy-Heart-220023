Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine egg, peanut butter and sugar in a bowl. The dough should be slightly dry; add small amounts of sugar if it seems too wet. Place dough between two sheets of wax paper and roll to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut the dough with a heart-shaped cookie cutter. Place the hearts on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, 7 to 10 minutes. Cool completely on the baking sheet. Melt the chocolate chips in the microwave at 30 second intervals until fully melted, stirring between intervals. Dip the bottom and sides of each cookie in the melted chocolate. Place cookies on wax paper to dry.
