Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Place 40 - 45 small graham crackers on cookie sheet. Combine margarine, butter (yes... 1 stick of each!) sugar, and nuts in a saucepan over medium heat. Let boil for 2 minutes. Spread over crackers. Bake 10 minutes. Remove and immediately transfer to foil with spatula.
