Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a foil-lined sheet pan on a lower oven rack. Wash and stem the grapes. Squeeze the pulp out of the skins into a saucepan, saving the skins in a bowl. Cook the pulp in a saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the seeds are beginning to come out. Strain the pulp into the skins, using a spoon to rub the pulp off the seeds. Add sugar, flour and lemon juice. Fit pastry into a 9-inch pie pan. Pour filling into crust. Use remaining pastry to make a lattice top. Bake in the preheated oven on the sheet pan for about 50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly.
