Whip the butter, olive oil, celery salt, poultry seasoning, cumin, onion powder, and garlic powder together until light and fluffy. Cover; refrigerate at least 4 hours. Allow the mixture to return to room temperature before using. Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Open the loaves of Italian bread with your fingers (do not use a knife) by pulling edges and ripping the bread into two equal portions (top and bottom). Spread the garlic butter evenly over the torn sides of the bread and place buttered-side-up onto a baking sheet. Broil in the preheated oven until golden brown and crunchy on top, 4 to 5 minutes. Serve hot.
