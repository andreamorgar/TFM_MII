In a shallow dish or bowl mix together the flour, cornstarch, seasoning salt, paprika, baking soda, dressing mix, soup mix, spaghetti sauce mix and sugar. Place cereal crumbs in another shallow dish or bowl, and mix together eggs and water in a third shallow dish or bowl. Heat oil (1 inch deep) in a large skillet over medium high heat. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dip chicken pieces into dry coating mix, egg/water mixture, cereal crumbs, briefly into dry mix once more, then drop into hot oil skin side down. Brown for 3 to 4 minutes, then brown other side of each piece. Place browned chicken pieces in a 9x13 inch baking dish, skin side up, and cover dish with aluminum foil leaving one side open for escaping steam. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 to 45 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and tender and juices run clear. Remove cover and bake another 5 minutes to let coating become crisp; serve.
