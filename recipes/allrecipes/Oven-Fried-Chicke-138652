Put oven rack in middle position and preheat to 450 degrees F. Bake bread crumbs in a small shallow baking pan until dry but not browned, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a shallow bowl and mix in 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Leave oven on. Stir together butter, mustard, mayonnaise, lemon juice, curry powder, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl. Brush butter mixture all over chicken, then transfer chicken to bowl of crumbs to coat evenly on both sides, pressing crumbs to help adhere. Bake chicken, skin sides up, in baking pan until well browned and cooked through, 30 to 40 minutes. Let chicken stand 5 to 10 minutes (do not cover).
