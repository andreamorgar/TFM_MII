Melt butter in a saucepan and stir honey and horseradish mustard into butter. Bring to a boil and remove from heat. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Place corned beef, fat side down, into a roasting pan. Pour half the honey-mustard sauce over brisket; broil until corned beef is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Serve corned beef with boiled potatoes and cabbage, topped with remaining honey-mustard sauce.
