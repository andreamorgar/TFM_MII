Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease baking sheets. In a medium bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Gradually blend in the egg yolk, orange zest, and honey. Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and mace; stir into the creamed mixture. Drop cookie dough by teaspoonfuls about 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheet. Flatten cookies with a fork dipped in flour. Brush lightly with egg white. Bake for 10 to 14 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool on wire racks after removing from oven.
