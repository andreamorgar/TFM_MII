Heat a skillet over medium heat. Place 1 tortilla in the skillet and top with 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese, turkey, cranberry sauce, jalapeno pepper, green onion, and remaining Cheddar cheese, respectively. Place remaining tortilla over the top. Cook until tortilla is golden brown and cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes per side.
