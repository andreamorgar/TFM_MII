Melt the butter or margarine, and add 1 cup sugar and the graham crackers. Press this mixture into a 9x13 pan. Beat the eggs. Gradually beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla into the eggs. Pour egg and cream cheese mixture over the graham cracker crust. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 15-20 minutes. Cool. Pour blueberry or cherry pie filling over the top of the baked dessert. Spread nondairy whipped topping on top of fruit. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
