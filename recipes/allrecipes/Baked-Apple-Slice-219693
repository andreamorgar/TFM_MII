Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread the apple slices into the bottom of a small baking dish. Whisk the water and cornstarch together in a small bowl; pour over the apple slices and gently stir. Sprinkle the sugar and cinnamon over the apple slices. Cook in the preheated oven until the apples are tender, about 15 minutes.
