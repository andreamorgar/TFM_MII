Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a double boiler melt chocolate and butter or margarine. Combine sugar and corn syrup in a medium saucepan. Bring to a rapid boil and allow mixture to boil 2 minutes. Add chocolate mixture, stirring well. Place eggs in a medium bowl. While whisking constantly, pour chocolate mixture over eggs. Whisk in vanilla extract, then stir in pecans. Pour mixture into pie shell. Bake in preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes. Cool before serving. Top each slice with a spoonful of whipped topping.
