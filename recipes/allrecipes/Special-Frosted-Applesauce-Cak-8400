Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8 inch square pan with parchment paper. Sift together flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and cloves. Set aside. Cream shortening and sugar until fluffy, add eggs and beat well. Fold in applesauce and flour mixture. Mix well. Fold in raisins. Pour batter into a parchment-lined 8 inch square pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out clean. Remove from oven and let cool to room temperature before frosting. Frosting Instructions: In a saucepan, combine brown sugar, white sugar, corn sugar and whipping cream. Cook, covered, over low heat 2 to 3 minutes to dissolve sugar crystals. Uncover and cook to soft ball stage (240 degrees F/ 115 degrees C). Cool to lukewarm, then beat to a spreading consistency and spread over cake.
