Brush pork chops with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with Cajun seasoning, to taste. Grill or broil until pork is no longer pink. Saute arugula in remaining 1/2 tablespoon olive oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat 2 to 3 minutes or until just wilted. Season with salt, to taste. Arrange arugula and pork chops on 2 large plates. Spoon Cran-Apple Salsa Dressing over pork, to taste. Refrigerate any remaining dressing.
