Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; add fennel, cloves, and cardamom. Continue boiling water for 3 minutes. Stir milk into the water and return mixture to a low boil; add tea bags, reduce heat to low, and boil until the tea has a strong, but not bitter flavor, 2 to 3 minutes. Strain tea into 4 tea mugs; sweeten with sugar to individual tastes.
