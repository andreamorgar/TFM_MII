Pick through the split peas removing rocks, then rinse. Soak, covered by 2-inches of water until soft enough to be broken with your fingernail, 3 hours to overnight. When soft, drain peas, then puree in 1 cup batches in a food processor or blender until smooth along with the garlic, curry powder, salt, and serrano pepper. Add water as needed to make a thick paste. Sift baking powder and 1/2 cup of flour into a large bowl then stir in the pea puree , adding additional flour to make a stiff batter. Heat 2 inches of oil in a deep-fryer or deep, heavy skillet over medium-high heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Drop batter by the teaspoonful into the hot oil in batches of about 10. Turn balls when they float and their bottoms turn brown, and continue cooking to brown the other side, about 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels, and sprinkle with additional salt if desired.
