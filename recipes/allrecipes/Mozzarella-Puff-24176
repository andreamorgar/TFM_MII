Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Make an indentation in the top of each uncooked biscuit. Fill indentations with oregano and a mozzarella cube. Pinch the dough around the mozzarella cubes. Place the biscuits, pinched side down, on a medium, ungreased baking sheet. Cover with pizza sauce. Bake in the preheated oven 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown.
