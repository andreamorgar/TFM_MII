Place the beef in a shallow dish. Combine soy sauce, sugar, green onion, garlic, sesame seeds, sesame oil, and ground black pepper in a small bowl. Pour over beef. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Quickly grill beef on hot grill until slightly charred and cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes per side.
