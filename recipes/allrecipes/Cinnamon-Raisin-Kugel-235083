Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Butter an 8x8-inch baking dish. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain. Whisk milk, sour cream, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup softened butter, raisins, eggs, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl. Mix noodles into the milk mixture; pour into the prepared baking dish. Mix corn flakes, 2 tablespoons melted butter, 2 tablespoons white sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl until crumbly; sprinkle over noodle mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until kugel is set in the middle, about 1 1/2 hours. Cut into 2-inch squares.
