Pick over and rinse the dried beans, and place them in a large saucepan of water with a lid. Bring to a boil over high heat, cover, turn off the heat, and let the beans sit for 1 hour. Drain and rinse the beans in a colander, return to the saucepan, cover with water, and simmer for 2 hours, until the beans are tender. Meanwhile, place the sausage, beef, onion, and green pepper in a skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir for about 10 minutes, until the3 sausage and beef are evenly brown. Stir the meat mixture into the beans, and mix in the tomatoes with chiles, ketchup, and chili powder. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for about 20 minutes to thicken.
