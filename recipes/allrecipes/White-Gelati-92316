In a medium bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth and well blended. In a separate bowl, dissolve the gelatin in boiling water. Stir into the cream cheese mixture along with the milk, lemon juice and vanilla. Fold in the whipped topping. Pour into a mold if desired, and refrigerate until set, about 3 hours.
