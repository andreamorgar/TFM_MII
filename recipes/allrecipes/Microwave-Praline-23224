In a large, microwave safe bowl, combine sugar, cream, salt, margarine and pecans. Microwave 9 minutes on high, stirring once. Let rest 1 minute. Stir in vanilla and continue to stir 3 minutes more. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto buttered waxed paper. (If mixture is runny, allow to cool 30 seconds more and try again.)
