Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (170 degrees C). Beat egg whites with the salt until foamy. Slowly add sugar, one tablespoonful at a time, beating after each addition until the meringue stands in stiff peaks. Stir in vanilla and fold in chocolate chips. Drop by teaspoonfuls on a lined baking sheet and place in preheated oven. After 2 minutes, turn off oven. Leave meringues in oven overnight. Remove from pan and store in cookie tin lined with paper towel.
