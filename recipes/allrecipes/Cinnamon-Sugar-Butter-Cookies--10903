Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). In a small bowl, combine 4 tablespoons white sugar and 2 tablespoons cinnamon for topping. Set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda and salt. Mix with wire whisk and set aside. In a large bowl, beat together both sugars on medium speed. Add butter and mix to form a grainy paste. Add eggs and vanilla, mix at medium speed until fluffy. Add the flour mixture a little at a time on low to medium speed just until combined. Shape dough into 1 inch balls and roll each ball into the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Place on ungreased cookie sheet, about 2 inches apart. Bake about 13-18 minutes until lightly golden. Place immediately on a flat surface to cool.
