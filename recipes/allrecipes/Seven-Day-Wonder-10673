Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Combine flour and pecans and set aside. Beat oil and honey together in a large bowl, then beat in the lemon zest. Gradually blend in the flour and pecans. Press the mixture evenly into an ungreased 9 inch square baking pan and bake for 15 minutes. While this is baking, mix together chopped dates and water in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat until mixture softens. Transfer this to a large bowl. With a wooden spoon, break up the warm dough and turn it into the bowl containing the date mixture. Add the coconut. Mix all thoroughly together. Form into a log 2 inches in diameter and wrap in waxed paper or foil. (For ease in handling, dust hands with flour.) Refrigerate for a week. To serve, cut into 1/4 inch slices.
