Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Brown chops on all sides and remove from pan. Add the garlic, onion, sauerkraut, caraway seed, apple juice, and salt and pepper to taste to the hot skillet. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Lay browned pork chops on top of sauerkraut mixture, cover, reduce heat to low and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
