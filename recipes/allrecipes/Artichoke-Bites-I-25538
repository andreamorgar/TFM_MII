Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease four 1 3/4 inch muffin pans. Place reserved liquid from marinated artichoke hearts in a medium saucepan. Over medium heat, slowly cook and stir onion and garlic until tender. In a blender or food processor, mix artichoke hearts, eggs, Cheddar cheese, Swiss cheese, Parmesan cheese, parsley, black pepper, Italian-style seasoning, hot pepper sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Blend until smooth. Stir in the onions, garlic and dry bread crumbs. Fill the muffin pans approximately 3/4 inch full with the mixture. Bake in the preheated oven 12 to 15 minutes, until firm and lightly browned. Serve warm.
