In a large bowl combine the chicken, onion, cloves, ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, ketchup, basil, parsley and eggs. Mix well and form about 30 balls out of the mixture, using hands. Roll balls in extra Parmesan cheese and cracker crumbs. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat and fry chicken balls until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
