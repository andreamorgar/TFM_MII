Melt the pound of chocolate and the butter together in a saucepan. In another bowl, beat the eggs and the sugar together at high speed until the mixture becomes thick and lemon colored and falls in ribbons from the beaters, about 5 minutes. Gently fold the melted chocolate-butter mixture into the egg mixture. In a separate bowl, sift the flour and baking powder together. Sift half of this over the chocolate mixture; fold it in. Repeat with the remaining flour mixture. Fold in the nuts and the chips. Cover the dough and chill for at least a few hours and as long as overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Wet your hands and remove large (about 3 tablespoons worth) clumps of chilled dough and quickly roll them into balls. Place the balls about 3 inches apart onto parchment lined sheets. Bake for about 18-20 minutes. The cookie will still appear moist when removed from oven but will firm up when cooled. Remove from oven and cool on sheet for about 10 minutes. Remove to a rack to cool.
