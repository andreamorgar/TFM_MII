Place dates in a bowl, cover with hot water, and soak until soft, about 6 to 10 minutes; drain. Puree dates, bananas, coconut milk, almond milk, vanilla, cocoa powder, and salt together in a blender until smooth, about 2 to 3 minutes; pour into popsicle molds. Freeze until solid throughout, about 6 hours.
