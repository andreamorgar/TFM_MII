Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 12 muffin cups with cooking spray. Mix egg substitute, spinach, bell peppers, Cheddar cheese, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl; spoon into the prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until tops begin to turn golden brown, about 25 minutes.
