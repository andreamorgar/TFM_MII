Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, thoroughly mix together the ground beef, half of one can of tomato soup, instant rice, onion, garlic, Italian seasoning, egg, and green bell pepper; season with salt and black pepper. Reserve remaining tomato soup. Form the meat mixture into a loaf, and place into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Bake the loaf in the preheated oven until browned and an instant-read meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 30 minutes. Remove from oven, and cover the loaf with the remaining 1 1/2 cans of tomato soup. Return to oven, and bake until the soup is hot and beginning to form a glaze on the meat, about 10 minutes.
