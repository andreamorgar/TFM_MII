Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes; drain. Stir noodles, tuna, black olives, and cream of mushroom soup together in the bottom of a casserole dish. Add 2/3 cup Cheddar cheese, hot pepper sauce, and black pepper to the noodle mixture; mix. Gently fold asparagus into the noodle mixture. Sprinkle remaining Cheddar cheese over the dish. Bake in preheated oven until hot and bubbly, about 30 minutes.
