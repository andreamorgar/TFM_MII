Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan. Whisk pumpkin, evaporated milk, sugar, eggs, and cinnamon together in a bowl until smooth; pour into prepared baking pan. Sprinkle cake mix and pecans over pumpkin mixture; top with melted butter. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center of the dessert comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool for 30 minutes before slicing.
