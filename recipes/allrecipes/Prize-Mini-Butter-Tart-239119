Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place tart shells on a baking tray. Beat brown sugar and butter together in a bowl until creamy; beat in eggs, cream, and vanilla extract until combined. Fill tart shells 2/3 full with butter mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is lightly golden, about 18 minutes; remove to cool on a wire rack.
