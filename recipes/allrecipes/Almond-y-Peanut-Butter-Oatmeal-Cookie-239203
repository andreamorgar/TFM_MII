Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Beat peanut butter, butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Beat eggs, 1 at a time, into creamed butter, beating well before adding next egg; mix in vanilla extract and almond extract. Slowly stir flour mixture into creamed butter mixture until fully incorporated; fold in oats using a wooden spoon. Roll dough into 1-inch balls and arrange 1-inch apart on a baking sheet. Press a fork into each cookie if desired. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes.
