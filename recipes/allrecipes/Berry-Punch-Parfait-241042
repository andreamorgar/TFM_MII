Rinse, stem, and slice the strawberries into bite-size pieces. Heat the strawberries and 1/3 cup Mott's Fruit Punch Rush in a wide skillet or saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir occasionally for about 10 minutes until the strawberries have softened. Cool the strawberries to room temperature and assemble the parfaits. Stir the yogurt and remaining 2 tablespoons Mott's Fruit Punch Rush together in a medium bowl. Spoon 1/4 cup yogurt into each jar, then top with about 2 tablespoons cooled strawberries. Sprinkle with 1-2 tablespoons granola. Repeat with another layer of each ingredient in each jar. Refrigerate until ready to serve. The granola in each parfait will stay crunchy for up to 4 hours; after that, it will be soggier but still delicious.
