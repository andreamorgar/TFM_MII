In a large pot over medium heat, combine the onion, garlic, red bell pepper and ground beef and saute for 10 minutes, or until meat is browned. Add the cumin, chili powder, oregano and bay leaf and saute for 2 to 3 more minutes. Then add the chicken broth and the tomatoes, mix well and cook for 30 minutes. Add the pinto beans and kidney beans and continue cooking for 10 more minutes. Finally, add the cornmeal, stirring well, until the chili thickens, about 10 to 15 minutes. Remove bay leaf.
