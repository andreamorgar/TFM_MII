Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet with a lid, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until cooked through but not crisp, about 6 minutes. Remove the bacon from the skillet and set aside. Sear the pork chops until browned on each side. Place the pork chops, onion, and potato slices into the skillet, and pour the water over the ingredients. Cover the skillet, bring to a boil over medium heat, reduce the heat, and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and serve.
