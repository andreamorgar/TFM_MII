Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Sift flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, and cocoa into a large mixing bowl. Chop chocolate into fine pieces and add to mixture. Cut the butter into small pieces and stir into the flour mixture. Add eggs and stir until the mixture forms a stiff dough. Wet hands with cold water and roll tablespoonfuls of dough into balls. Place on cookie sheets 3 inches apart. Bake for 13 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until centers look dry. Transfer to wire racks to cool.
