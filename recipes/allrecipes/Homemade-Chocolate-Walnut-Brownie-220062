Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 9"x9" square baking pan. In a double boiler over low heat, melt butter and chocolate chips together and remove from heat. In a separate bowl, combine dry ingredients. When the chocolate/butter mixture has cooled a little whisk in the eggs and vanilla. Note: it is important to cool the chocolate/butter mixture or the eggs will cook. Add the dry ingredients and whisk to combine. Stir in the chopped walnuts. Pour batter into prepared baking pan. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until a knife inserted into center comes out clean.
