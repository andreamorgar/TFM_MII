In a medium bowl, mix together cream cheese, mayonnaise, green olives, black olives and green onions. Spread cream cheese mixture in a thin layer onto each tortilla. Roll up tortillas. Chill about 1 hour, or until the filling is firm. Slice chilled rollups into 1 inch pieces. Serve with salsa for dipping.
