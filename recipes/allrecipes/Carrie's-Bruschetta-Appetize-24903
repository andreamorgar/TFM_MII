Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Mix in tomatoes, fresh basil leaves and garlic. Cook and stir until heated and slightly tender, about 5 minutes. In a small bowl, blend cream cheese with herb and garlic feta. In a toaster or an oven heated to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), lightly toast the sourdough bread slices. Spread toasted bread slices with the cream cheese blend. Top with tomato mixture. Sprinkle with desired amount of mozzarella cheese.
