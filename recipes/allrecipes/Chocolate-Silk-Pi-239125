Beat confectioners' sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; mix in melted chocolate and vanilla extract until smooth. Add eggs, 1 at a time, to creamed butter mixture, beating for 5 minutes before adding the next one; spread into the graham cracker crust. Refrigerate pie until chilled, at least 3 hours. Top pie with whipped topping.
