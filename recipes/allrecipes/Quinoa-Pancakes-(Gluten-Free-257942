Combine quinoa flour, tapioca flour, ground flax seeds, baking powder, potato flour, potato starch, salt, baking soda, and xanthan gum in a large bowl. Whisk water and egg together in a separate bowl. Pour over quinoa flour mixture; mix until batter is well blended. Mix in 3 tablespoons oil. Heat 1 teaspoon grapeseed oil in a skillet over medium heat. Drop 1/3 cup batter into the skillet and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
