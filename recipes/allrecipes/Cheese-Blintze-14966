Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a cookie sheet generously with non-stick cooking spray. Trim crusts from bread and roll the slices flat. In a small bowl combine sugar and cinnamon to make a mixture. In a large mixing bowl, mix softened cream cheese, milk and vanilla until smooth. Spread this mixture onto each slice of flattened bread. Roll each bread slice up. Dip bread/cream cheese rolls in melted butter, roll the blintzes immediately in the sugar-cinnamon mixture. Cut rolls into 1 inch pieces. Arrange the blintzes on the prepared cookie sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. Serve with sour cream.
