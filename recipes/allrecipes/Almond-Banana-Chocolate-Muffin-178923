Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Prepare a muffin tin with paper liners. Prepare muffins according to package instructions using water, eggs and oil, but use only 1/4 cup oil instead of 1/2 cup, and add 1/4 cup applesauce. Stir in banana, 3/4 cup almonds and chocolate. Divide evenly among muffin cups and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup almonds. Bake 15-20 minutes, until a tester comes out clean. Cool muffin tin on a rack for 10 minutes, then remove muffins and continue cooling on rack. Store air tight at room temperature for up to 4 days.
