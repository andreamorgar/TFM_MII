Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix 2 tablespoons flour and brown sugar together. Toss sugar and flour with apples. Sprinkle one tablespoon flour on bottom crust, roll lightly to fit a 9 or 10 inch pie pan. Arrange apples in the bottom crust, and spread caramel sauce over apples. Roll out second crust with the rest of the flour. Lay over apples. Tuck over bottom crust and pinch edges together. Cut a few steam holes in top of pie. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool before serving.
