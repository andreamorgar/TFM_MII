Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cook breakfast sausage according to package directions; set aside. In a skillet, brown the hash browns in butter until crisp. Spread hash browns into the bottom of a greased 9-in. deep dish pie plate (about 1-3/4 in. deep) Sprinkle cheese into center of the pie plate. Arrange breakfast sausage around the edge of the pie plate at a slight angle; using cheese to help hold up the links. In a bowl, combine the eggs, cream, onion powder, salt and pepper; pour into pie plate. Arrange tomato slices on top of quiche; sprinkle with chives. Cover sausage at edge of quiche with foil to prevent overbrowning. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until eggs are set. Let rest 5 minutes before cutting.
