Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Stir peaches, mango, rum, lemon zest, almond extract, 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Stir water, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup stevia sugar substitute, and brown sugar substitute together in a pot; bring to a simmer. Stir peach mixture into pot; cook and stir until peaches are heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk flour, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup stevia sugar substitute, and a pinch of cinnamon together in a bowl; add milk and whisk to form a smooth batter. Pour melted batter into the bottom of a Dutch oven. Pour batter over butter. Gently spread peach mixture with syrup on top of the batter. Bake cobbler in the preheated oven until syrup is bubbling and crust is risen and golden brown, 50 to 55 minutes.
