Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Stir in egg, buttermilk and oil until mixture is smooth. Pour the batter by spoonfuls into the hot pan, forming 5 inch circles. When the edges appear to harden, flip the pancakes. Cook on both sides until golden brown. Serve hot.
