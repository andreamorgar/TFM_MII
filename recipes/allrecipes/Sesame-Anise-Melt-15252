Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt, set aside. In a medium bowl, cream together the lard and sugar. Stir in the egg and anise seeds. Add dry ingredients, mix well. Put the sesame seeds into a shallow bowl or saucer. Roll dough into 1 inch balls, roll them in the sesame seeds to coat. Place them 1 1/2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Flatten the balls slightly using the bottom of a glass. Bake for 6 to 9 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks. Store in an airtight container.
