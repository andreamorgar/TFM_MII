In a large skillet or frying pan, melt butter over medium heat. Add apples and saute until tender but not completely cooked. Heat a lightly oiled omelet pan or medium sized skillet. Whisk together eggs, cream, salt, pepper and sugar. Pour egg mixture into omelet pan. When bottom of omelet has begun to set, place half of the apple mixture on top of the eggs. When bottom of omelet is completely cooked, fold over omelet, cover and cook through. Serve warm with remaining apples on top or on the side.
