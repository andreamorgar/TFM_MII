Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch baking dish. Whisk all-purpose flour, buckwheat flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Add milk, egg, and margarine to flour mixture and beat until batter is smooth; pour into prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes.
