In a medium mixing bowl, mix together eggs and white sugar. Stir in milk. In the lower pot of a double boiler, add water and bring to a low boil. Into the top pot, pour milk and sugar mixture. Cook over medium heat until mixture coats a spoon, about 30 minutes. Add vanilla extract and strain using a sieve. Chill before serving.
