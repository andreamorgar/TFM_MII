Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place cashews on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until warmed through, about 10 minutes. Stir rosemary, margarine, brown sugar, salt, and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl. Pour warm cashews into the rosemary mixture and toss to coat. Serve warm or allow to cool and store in an airtight container.
