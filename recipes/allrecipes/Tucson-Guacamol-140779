In a bowl, beat cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth. Add two avocados, green chiles, Worcestershire sauce, garlic salt and pepper; beat until fairly smooth. Gently mix in remaining avocado, leaving it a little chunky. Serve immediately or store in refrigerator covered with plastic wrap, pushing the wrap down so that it is touching the entire surface of the guacamole.
