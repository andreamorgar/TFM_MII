Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8 inch pan. In a medium bowl, cream together the sugar and butter. Stir in the chocolate syrup and eggs until well mixed. Mix in the flour and pecans. Spread evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.
