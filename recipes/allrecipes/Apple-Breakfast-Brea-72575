Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x4 inch loaf pan. In a bowl, mix the butter and sugar until smooth and creamy. Beat in the eggs. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and cloves. Mix into the butter mixture until moistened. Fold in the apples. Transfer to the prepared loaf pan. Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan for 15 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
