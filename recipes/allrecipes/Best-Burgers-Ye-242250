Mix ground beef and ground pork together in a bowl using 2 spoons. Heat lard in a a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir shallots and garlic until fragrant and tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add shallot mixture to meat mixture; season with salt and black pepper. Form mixture into patties, taking care to handle mixture as little as possible. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill hamburgers on the preheated grill until desired doneness is reached, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
