Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter one 8x11x2 inch casserole dish. In a medium sized mixing bowl, combine the creamed corn, eggs, 1/4 cup of the melted butter and 1/2 of the cracker crumbs. Pour mixture in into the prepared dish. In a small bowl, mix the remaining melted butter, cracker crumbs, paprika and pepper. Sprinkle crumb topping over the casserole. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 40 minutes, until topping browns slightly and corn is bubbly around the edges.
