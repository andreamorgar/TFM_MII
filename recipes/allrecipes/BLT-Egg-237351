Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crispy, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels. Lightly beat eggs and sour cream together in a bowl. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir egg mixture and hot sauce in the hot oil until light and fluffy, 5 to 7 minutes. Fold tomatoes, avocado, and spinach into egg mixture just until warmed, 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over egg mixture and cook until cheese is lightly melted, 1 to 2 minutes; season with salt and pepper.
