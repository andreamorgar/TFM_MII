Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Prepare and bake cake mix according to package directions for one 9x13 inch cake. Remove cake from oven. While cake is hot, poke holes through the cake with the round handle of a wooden spoon. Holes should be at 1 inch intervals. Pour crushed pineapple and juice over the cake. Let cool slightly. In a small bowl, beat the instant pudding with milk until mixture begins to thicken, about 2 minutes. Stir in the frozen whipped topping, then spread over the cake. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
