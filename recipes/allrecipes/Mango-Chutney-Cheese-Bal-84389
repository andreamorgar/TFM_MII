In a medium bowl, stir together the cream cheese, raisins, bacon, green onions and sour cream. Form into a ball, and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight before serving. To serve, place the cheese ball on a serving tray, and pour the mango chutney over it. Surround with crackers for dipping.
