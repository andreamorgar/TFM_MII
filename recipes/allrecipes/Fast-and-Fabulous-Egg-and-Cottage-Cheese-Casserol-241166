Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prepare a 10x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Mix eggs, cottage cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, green chiles, butter, flour, bacon, and baking powder together in a large bowl; pour into prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until a toothpick inserted into the center of the casserole comes out clean, about 30 minutes more.
