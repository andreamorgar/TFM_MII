In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Stir in the vanilla and oats. Next, combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Divide the dough into 3 sections, and shape each section into a log about 8 inches long. Roll each log in the sprinkles to coat, then wrap them in waxed paper and chill overnight. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets or line them with parchment paper. Cut the cookie dough rolls into 1/4 inch slices and place them 1 inch apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove from baking sheet to cool on wire racks.
