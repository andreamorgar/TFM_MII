Saute onion in butter with parsley flakes until onion is tender, about 8 minutes. Sprinkle flour over mixture and stir (will be lumpy). Slowly stir in the half and half until smooth and creamy. Add corn and cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. To serve, ladle into bowls and garnish with popped corn.
