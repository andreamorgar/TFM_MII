Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease cookie sheets. Mix sugar, shortening, egg, honey, and lemon extract. Stir in remaining ingredients and mix well. Roll dough 1/4 inch thick. Use cookie cutters to cut into desired shapes. Place 1 inch apart on lightly greased cookie sheet. Bake 7 to 8 minutes or until no indentation remains when touched. Cool and decorate.
