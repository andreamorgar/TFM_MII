Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat butter in microwave oven in a 4-cup microwave-safe measuring cup until melted but not hot, about 1 minute. Beat eggs, sugar, and flour into butter with a fork until smooth. Spread the rhubarb into the unbaked pie crust and pour the liquid ingredients over the rhubarb. Bake pie in the preheated oven until the filling is lightly browned, about 45 minutes.
