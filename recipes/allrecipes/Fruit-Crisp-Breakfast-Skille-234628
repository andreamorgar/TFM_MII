Stir oats, almonds, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Mix 1/2 cup coconut oil into oat mixture until crumbly. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons coconut oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir apples in hot oil until crisp and tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Mix honey and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon into apples. Pour oat mixture into skillet with apple mixture, lower heat to medium, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until oats are cooked and tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
