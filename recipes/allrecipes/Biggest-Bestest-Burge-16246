Preheat oven to broil. In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, onion, salt, ground black pepper and basil; mix together well. Then add the bread crumbs, cheese and teriyaki sauce. Mix this together well and divide into 4 to 6 large, round balls. Place the hamburger balls onto a broiler pan, evenly spaced. Press down on each ball, either with your palm or with a spatula, until a perfectly round patty is formed. Broil for 8 minutes, turn each patty over, and broil for 8 minutes more. (Note: The outside of each patty should appear almost burnt.) Turn off heat and place cheese slices on each patty. When cheese is melted, remove from oven and serve on onion rolls.
