Stir milk, egg, crumbled bacon, and chives together in a 2-cup glass measuring cup. Cook in microwave oven until the egg mixture is solid in the center, 90 seconds to 2 minutes. Heat a small skillet over medium heat; cook sausage patty in hot skillet until hot in the center, 2 to 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Sandwich the cooked egg, sausage, and cheese between the donut halves.
