Place the pine nuts, basil, and oregano into a food processor. Cover, and pulse 2 or 3 times to finely grind the nuts. Add beans and garlic; process until smooth, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Pour in the lime juice, tomato, salt and pepper, and pulse 2 to 3 times until mixture is smooth and spreadable. With the food processor running, drizzle the oil into the dip. If mixture becomes too thick, add a tablespoon of water at a time until the dip is the right consistency. Refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight to blend the flavors before serving.
