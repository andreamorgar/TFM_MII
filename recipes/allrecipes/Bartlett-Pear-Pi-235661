Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press pie crust pastry into a 9-inch pie dish and refrigerate while preparing filling. Beat butter, white sugar, brown sugar, flour, nutmeg, allspice, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth. Beat eggs, 1 at a time, into butter mixture until incorporated; fold in pears. Pour filling into chilled crust. Bake in the preheated oven until filling is set in the middle, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool completely before serving, about 1 hour.
