Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange bagels on prepared baking sheet, cut sides up. Spoon a thin layer of pizza sauce over each bagel half and sprinkle with pizza cheese. Place 2 pepperoni slices on each bagel. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and pepperoni is lightly browned, about 6 minutes.
