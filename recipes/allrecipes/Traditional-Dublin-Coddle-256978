Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels, reserving grease in the skillet. Slice into big chunky pieces and transfer to a large pot. Cook sausages, turning occasionally, in the bacon grease until browned, about 5 minutes; add to the large pot. Cook and stir onion in the same skillet until softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer to the pot. Arrange potatoes over onion. Pour in enough water to cover the potatoes. Cover the pot; bring water to a boil. Reduce heat to very low; simmer until potatoes are tender, 1 to 1 hour 30 minutes. Garnish with parsley.
