Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix together the cracker crumbs, sugar, and butter in a bowl until evenly moistened. Press into the bottom and 1/2 inch up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan. In a large bowl, mix together the cream cheese and sugar with an electric mixer until smooth. Blend in the eggs, 1 tablespoon of vanilla, and cream of tartar. Pour over the pie crust. Bake in preheated oven until the center is set, about 50 minutes. Allow to cool on counter for 5 minutes. Mix together the sour cream, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 1/2 cup sugar in a bowl until smooth; carefully pour over cheesecake starting from the sides of the pan and working your way to the center. Return to oven for another 5 minutes. Allow to cool in pan to room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours before serving.
