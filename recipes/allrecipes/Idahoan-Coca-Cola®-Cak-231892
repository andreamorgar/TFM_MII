Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat the sides and bottom of spring form pan with nonstick cooking spray. Melt stick of butter in a large, wide sauce pan. Add cola, cocoa powder and superfine sugar and whisk until smooth. Remove from heat. Whisk sour cream, eggs and vanilla thoroughly until almost a batter-like consistency and add slowly into the slightly cooled butter mixture. Add dry Original Mashed Potato flakes and baking soda. Stir thoroughly. The batter will have a slightly grainy appearance but don't be concerned. Pour into spring form pan and bake for 45 minutes to an hour. Test center of cake with a wooden toothpick (cake is done when the toothpick comes out clean). Cool and remove from spring form pan. Note: This is a very dark and dense cake. Frosting: The cream cheese should be at room temperature. Add cream and powdered sugar and mix in a food processor or with a large whisk. Adjust powdered sugar and cream to ensure a nicely thick frosting that is still spreadable. Frost just the top of the cake once it's unmolded and serve chilled. This cake is even better the next day!
