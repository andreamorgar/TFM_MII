Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place 62 pretzels on the prepared baking sheet. Place 1 pumpkin spice-flavored candy on each pretzel. Place in preheated oven until candies are slightly softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove baking sheet from oven and immediately top each with another pretzel, lightly pressing down. Cool to room temperature on the baking sheet.
