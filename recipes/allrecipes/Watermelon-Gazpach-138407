Seed 1 cup watermelon chunks and cut into small dice. Puree remaining watermelon in a blender (in batches if necessary). Pour puree through a sieve into a bowl, pressing on solids, and discard seeds. Return juice to blender and blend together with ice, almonds, and garlic (in batches if necessary) until smooth. Add bread, vinegar, salt, and pepper to taste and blend, adding oil in a slow stream, until smooth. Top with diced watermelon.
