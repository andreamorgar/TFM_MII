Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Wrap 1/2 strip of bacon around each water chestnut. Combine ketchup and sugar in a small bowl and mix together; dip each wrapped water chestnut into this mixture. Place water chestnuts in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish and bake covered in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until bacon is crisp.
