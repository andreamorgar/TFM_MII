Mix together Alfredo sauce with chipotle sauce. Add the chicken mix until well blended. Place a slice of bacon on a tortilla. Spoon some of the chicken mixture on the tortilla and top with onion slices. Roll up the tortilla and secure with a toothpick. Fill and secure the other tortillas with the rest of the chicken and onions. Heat oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Place rolled tortillas in the skillet in a single layer. Fry on each side until golden brown. Brown in batches if necessary. Serve with guacamole and pico de gallo.
