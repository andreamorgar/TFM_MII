Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the penne pasta, and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, and rinse under cold water until the pasta is cold; drain well. Place the drained penne pasta into a large mixing bowl, and stir in the chicken, celery, cranberries, and green onions. Pour in the salad dressing and lemon juice; stir until evenly mixed.
