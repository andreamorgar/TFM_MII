Combine chicken, grapes, pineapple chunks, celery, and water chestnuts in a large salad bowl. Mix mayonnaise, soy sauce, lemon juice, and curry powder in a separate bowl. Pour dressing over salad and toss lightly to coat. Cover and chill 8 hours to overnight. Stir almonds into salad just before serving; garnish with papaya and avocado slices.
