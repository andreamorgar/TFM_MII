Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk together the cornstarch, cinnamon and 1/4 of the apple juice. In a saucepan over medium heat, simmer the apples in the remaining apple juice until tender. Add the cornstarch mixture and stir until thickened. Pour into bottom crust and cover with top crust. Bake for 45 minutes.
