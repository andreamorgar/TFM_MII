Place white sugar, brown sugar, butter, milk, and carob powder in a large pan over medium-high heat; bring to a boil. Boil for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the pan from the heat, and stir in macadamia nut butter until dissolved. Stir in oatmeal until well incorporated. Drop onto a waxed paper lined cookie sheet, and place in the refrigerator to cool.
