Place flour in a bowl with the sugar and salt. Cut the butter and shortening into pieces, and cut into the flour until crumbly. Mix in vanilla. Add just enough water to form a ball: it should not be sticky. Knead quickly into a smooth ball. Wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for 1 hour. When ready to make pie, roll dough out as you would any crust. Do not let sit out, or handle excessively allowing to soften. Easiest to work with if firm.
