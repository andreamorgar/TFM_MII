Put oven rack in lower third of oven and preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Brush cut sides of baguette with oil. Arrange, cut sides up, on a baking sheet and bake until golden, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat water with broth, salt, and pepper in a 2- to 2 1/2-quart saucepan over moderate heat until hot. Stir in frozen spinach and cheese and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until spinach is just tender, about 8 minutes. Add beaten eggs in a slow, steady stream, stirring constantly. Serve with freshly ground pepper and a slice of toasted baguette in the soup.
