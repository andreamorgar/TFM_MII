Cover noodles with cold water; set aside to soak, about 30 minutes. Place chicken, ginger, star anise, and monosodium glutamate in a large pot. Sprinkle with salt and cover with water. Cook over medium heat until juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken from pot and cool until easily handled, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove skin and shred chicken meat. Drain noodles. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain and divide among serving bowls. Top noodles with shredded chicken and ladle in broth.
