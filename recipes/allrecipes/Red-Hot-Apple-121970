Place each apple in the center of a piece of heavy-duty foil (12 in. square). Spoon 1 teaspoon sugar and 1 tablespoon red-hots into the center of each apple. Fold foil around apple and seal tightly. Grill, covered, over medium-hot heat for 30 minutes or until apples are tender. Carefully transfer apples and syrup to bowls. Serve warm with ice cream if desired.
