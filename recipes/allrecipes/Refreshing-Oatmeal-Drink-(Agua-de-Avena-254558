Combine 5 cups water, quick-cooking oats, and cinnamon stick in a blender; blend until combined, about 1 minute. Pour the oat mixture through a strainer, collecting the liquids in a pitcher and reserving the solids. Pour remaining water through the strainer containing the solids and into the pitcher. Add sugar and vanilla extract; refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.
