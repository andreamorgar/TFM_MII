Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks. Whip cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Beat sugar, egg yolks, and salt together in a bowl until very thick and lemon-colored; stir in rum. Fold egg yolk mixture into whipped cream; fold egg whites into whipped cream mixture. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours.
