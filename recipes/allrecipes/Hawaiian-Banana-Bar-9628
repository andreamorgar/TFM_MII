Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 11x7 inch pan. In large mixing bowl, mix shortening, brown sugar, vanilla, lemon juice and banana until well blended. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Add to the banana mixture; stir until well blended. Stir in chopped nuts. Pour into the prepared pan. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven. While warm, cut into bars and remove from pan. Combine powdered sugar and cinnamon. Gently roll warm bars in sugar-cinnamon mixture.
