Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour one 9 x 13 inch baking pan. Combine water, sugar, shortening, salt, cocoa, raisins, and spices in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, and continue to boil for 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla and nuts. Combine flour and baking soda. Stir into boiled mixture, and thoroughly mix. Pour into prepared pan, and spread evenly. Bake for 50 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool.
