In a bowl, mash the butter and flour together until smooth and creamy. Beat in the cream, 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time, until thoroughly combined. Scrape the dough onto a large sheet of plastic wrap, wrap tightly, and chill at least 1 hour to overnight. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll the dough out 1/4 inch thick on a floured work surface, and cut into 2-inch circles with a cutter. Place sugar into a shallow bowl, and dip each cookie into the sugar on both sides. Place the cookies onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake cookies in the preheated oven until the edges turn light golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool for about 5 minutes on sheets before removing to cool completely on racks.
