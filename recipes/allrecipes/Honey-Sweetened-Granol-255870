Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray. Mix oats, flour, shredded coconut, pecans, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Stir in honey, coconut oil, and vanilla extract until evenly incorporated. Spread oat mixture on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 10 minutes. Stir gently. Continue baking, stirring every 5 minutes, until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool until crispy, about 15 minutes. Store in airtight container.
