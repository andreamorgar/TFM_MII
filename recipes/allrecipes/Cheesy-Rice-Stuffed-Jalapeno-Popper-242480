Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Prepare rice according to package directions. Allow to cool slightly. Mix rice, cream cheese, shredded cheese, taco seasoning, and cilantro together in a bowl. Combine thoroughly. Fill each jalapeno half with about a teaspoon of rice mixture, depending on size of jalapeno. Arrange filled jalapeno halves on prepared baking sheet. Mix panko bread crumbs and melted butter together in a small bowl. Top filled jalapenos with crumb mixture. Bake poppers in preheated oven until lightly golden on top, about 15 to 20 minutes.
