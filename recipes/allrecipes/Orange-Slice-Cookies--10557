In large mixing bowl, cream together sugars and shortening till fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla; beat well. Stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir into creamed mixture. Stir in the oats, and the orange candy. NOTE: Dip a pair of kitchen shears into a glass of hot water or spray with a non-stick spray to make snipping the orange slices easier. Using about one tablespoon of mixture for each cookie, roll into one inch balls. Place on greased cookie sheets. Bake in a 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove and cool on a wire rack.
