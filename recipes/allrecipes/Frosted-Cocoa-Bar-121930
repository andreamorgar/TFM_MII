In a mixing bowl, cream shortening and brown sugar. Beat in corn syrup and vanilla. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine flour, cocoa and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture. Spread into a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt butter until golden brown, about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in sugar, coffee, vanilla and enough milk until frosting reaches spreading consistency. Frost cooled brownies. Cover and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour, before cutting.
