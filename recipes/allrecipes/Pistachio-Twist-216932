Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Unfold the sheets of puff pastry, and brush tops with egg white. Sprinkle pistachios and salt over the egg white wash; flip the sheets, brush with egg white, and sprinkle with pistachios and salt. With a sharp knife, cut pastry into 3-inch long strips, about 3/4 inch wide. Twist the strips twice, then arrange on the prepared baking sheets so they don't touch. Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 15 minutes.
