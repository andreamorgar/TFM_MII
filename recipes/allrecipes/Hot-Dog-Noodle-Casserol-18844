Prepare spinach according to package directions. Drain and spread in the bottom of a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg noodles and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain and place on top of spinach in baking dish. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl combine the soup, milk, sour cream and hot dogs. Mix together and place mixture on top of noodles. Cover dish with aluminum foil and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 45 minutes, or until heated through. Sprinkle with peas and bacon and heat in oven until peas are just hot.
