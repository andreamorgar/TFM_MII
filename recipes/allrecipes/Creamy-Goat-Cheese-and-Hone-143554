Divide the goat cheese into 12 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball. Combine the crushed pecans and cinnamon in a bowl. Roll each goat cheese ball in the pecan mixture until covered. Gently pat the balls into patties; transfer to a serving plate. Drizzle honey over the patties and sprinkle rosemary on top. Serve immediately.
