Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Press cookie dough into the bottom of a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until light-golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely. Mix cream cheese, brown sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth; fold in cinnamon chips. Spread cream cheese mixture over cooled cookie and layer with apple slices. Sprinkle cinnamon sugar and nutmeg over apple slice layer. Cut into squares.
