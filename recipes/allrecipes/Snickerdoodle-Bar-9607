Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease 13 x 9 inch baking pan. Melt shortening over low heat. Add eggs and sugar, mixing well. In a separate bowl, mix together flour, baking powder and salt until well blended. Add to the egg mixture. Spread batter into baking pan. Sprinkle thickly with cinnamon and chopped nuts. Bake until light brown, about 10 to 15 minutes. Cut into squares and remove from pan immediately.
