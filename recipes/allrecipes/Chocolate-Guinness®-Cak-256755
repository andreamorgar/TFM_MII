Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch cake pan with 3-inch sides. Sift flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Combine brown sugar and butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one a time. Mix in vanilla extract. Beat in flour mixture in thirds, alternating with stout beer, until batter is smooth. Fold in pecans. Pour batter into the prepared cake pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 70 to 75 minutes. Transfer cake pan to a wire rack; let cool for 20 minutes. Invert cake onto a serving platter and let cool completely.
