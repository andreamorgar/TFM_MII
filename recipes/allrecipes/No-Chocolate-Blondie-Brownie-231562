Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8-inch square baking dish. Combine butter and milk in a large saucepan over low heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until butter melts, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Stir brown sugar and egg into the butter mixture. Sift flour into the butter mixture; stir. Add walnuts and vanilla extract; stir. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. Cut into 2-inch squares to serve.
