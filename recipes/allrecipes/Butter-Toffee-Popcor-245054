Pop popcorn in an air popper according to manufacturer's instructions. Combine sugar, corn syrup, butter, and water in a heavy saucepan over medium heat; cook until toffee syrup temperature reaches 280 degrees F (138 degrees C) using a candy thermometer, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract. Mix toffee syrup with popcorn in a large bowl until evenly combined.
