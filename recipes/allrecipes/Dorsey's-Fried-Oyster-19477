Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine oysters, oyster juice, egg, salt, pepper and Old Bay Seasoning. Gently stir in pancake mix to make a thin batter. Spoon oysters one at a time into hot oil. There should be just enough batter surrounding oysters to coat them but it should not be too thick. Fry until golden brown on both sides. Drain and serve.
