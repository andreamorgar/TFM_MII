Cream the butter or margarine until light and fluffy. Add the bananas and mix well. Beat in the eggs and vanilla. Sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, ground nutmeg and ground cinnamon. Add the dry mixture to the creamed mixture and mix well. Stir in the oats and the chopped nuts. Cover and chill dough for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets. Drop chilled teaspoon-sized rounds of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes.
