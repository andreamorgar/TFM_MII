Line an aluminum loaf pan with waxed paper. Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes. Mix walnuts, goat milk, corn syrup, vanilla extract, and salt into chocolate; stir until glossy. Pour into prepared loaf pan; cool until solidified, 2 hours or overnight. Invert loaf pan to remove fudge, peel off waxed paper, and cut into squares. Refrigerate to set, about 30 minutes.
