Preheat grill for high heat. Place 1 ounce of chocolate on the flat side of 4 of the oatmeal cookies. Skewer the marshmallows, and roast them, turning constantly, until they are a golden brown all over. Slide a warm marshmallow onto the chocolate and top it with another cookie (flat side down). Repeat for all cookies. Let sit for a couple of minutes to melt chocolate, and serve.
