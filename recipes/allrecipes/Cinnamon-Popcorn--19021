Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (93 degrees C). In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine corn syrup, margarine and salt. Heat to 242 to 248 degrees F (116 to 120 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a firm but pliable ball. Remove from heat and stir in food coloring, cinnamon oil and baking soda. Pour over popcorn; toss to coat. Place popcorn on baking sheet and into preheated oven. Bake 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes.
