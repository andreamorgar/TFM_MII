Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease and lightly flour 2 sheet cake pans. Mix flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves together in a large bowl. Beat sugar and sweet potatoes in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add eggs, oil, and orange juice; beat until well combined. Pour flour mixture into potato mixture and beat for 4 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl twice. Pour batter into prepared sheet cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 60 to 90 minutes.
