Pour hoisin sauce into a resealable plastic bag, and add the chicken breasts and thighs. Squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or overnight. Prepare the grill for indirect heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from marinade. Discard marinade. Grill chicken over indirect heat, skin side down, for 20 minutes. Turn; grill until chicken is no longer pink in the center, and juices run clear, about 10 additional minutes.
