Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Combine all ingredients and mix well. Batter will be thick. Roll dough into balls the size of nickels. Place on greased cookie sheets about 2 inches apart. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes. When cookies are cool, frost the bottoms of half of the cookies with Faux-reo filling(see footnote) and stick bottom-to-bottom with another unfrosted cookie.
