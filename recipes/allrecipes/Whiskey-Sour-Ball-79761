In a medium bowl, mix together the coconut, vanilla wafer crumbs, pecans, orange juice concentrate, vanilla and bourbon. Cover and refrigerate for several hours or overnight. Roll the dough into 1 inch balls, and roll in confectioners' sugar. If not serving right away, give them a fresh roll in the sugar just before serving.
