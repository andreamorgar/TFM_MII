Dip jackfruit into the batter and deep-fry until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Bring milk to a boil in a small pot; boil for 2 minutes. Add chocolate; stir until melted and smooth. Add 1 tablespoon sugar; stir until dissolved, about 1 minute. Simmer chocolate sauce over low heat, about 5 minutes. Place fried jackfruit on a serving plate. Pour chocolate sauce on top.
