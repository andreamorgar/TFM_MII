Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl. Heat olive oil in a large pot over low heat; cook and stir onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic in the hot oil until onion is lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Mix parsley, sage, basil, and lemon zest in a bowl; stir into onion mixture. Cook until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour 1 cup seafood stock in a measuring cup and set aside; pour remaining stock and lemon juice into onion mixture. Stir in thyme, cilantro, dill, sea salt, and black pepper; cook until flavors have blended, about 5 minutes. Add crawfish to seasoned stock mixture; cook until crawfish are heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir shrimp into crawfish mixture; cook until shrimp are pink and cooked through, about 5 more minutes. Remove crawfish and shrimp from sauce using a slotting spoon; transfer to a bowl and cover. Whisk cornstarch into reserved 1 cup seafood stock until completely dissolved; stir into sauce. Cook, stirring constantly, at a simmer until sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes. Mix half-and-half and Creole seasoning into sauce until fully incorporated and warmed; add crawfish and shrimp back into sauce. Toss sauce with egg noodles.
