Brown ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat. Season with salt. Stir in butter, mushrooms, onion, and garlic; cook until the onions are soft. In a small bowl, stir together white wine and flour. Stir into meat, along with mushroom soup and beef broth. Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, allowing to thicken. (If you need more liquid, stir in additional broth.) Serve seasoned with a dash of Worcestershire sauce.
