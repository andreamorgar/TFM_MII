Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a deep 9-inch square baking pan, add the peaches, pears, blueberries and 2 cups applesauce. In a separate bowl, mix 2 cups pancake/biscuit mix with 1 cup applesauce. Spread the mixture over the fruit. Sprinkle with sugar. Bake 35-45 minutes or until the top is brown and sides are bubbling.
