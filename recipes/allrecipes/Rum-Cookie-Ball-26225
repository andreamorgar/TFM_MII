In the microwave or in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water, melt chocolate chips, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from heat and stir in corn syrup and rum. Combine the vanilla wafer crumbs, confectioners' sugar and pecans; stir into the chocolate mixture until well blended. Chill until firm, about 1 hour. Roll dough into 1 inch balls. Refrigerate in an airtight container until serving.
