Toss greens together, then divide into 2 batches. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then add 1 batch of greens, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/40 teaspoon pepper and saute, tossing with 2 wooden spatulas or tongs, until evenly wilted but still crunchy, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and add 2 teaspoons lemon juice, tossing to coat. Transfer to a serving dish. Repeat procedure with remaining oil, greens, salt, pepper, and lemon juice.
