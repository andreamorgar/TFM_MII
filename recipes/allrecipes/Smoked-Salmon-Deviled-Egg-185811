Place the eggs into a saucepan in a single layer and fill with water to cover the eggs by 1 inch. Cover the saucepan and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, remove from the heat and let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15 minutes. Pour out the hot water, then cool the eggs under cold running water in the sink. Peel once cold. Cut eggs in half lengthwise and scoop out yolks. Mash the yolks with a fork in a small mixing bowl. Mix in the smoked salmon, mayonnaise, lemon juice, yellow mustard, 1 teaspoon dried dill, and the salt and pepper, combining well. Spoon or pipe the yolk mixture into the egg whites and sprinkle with paprika and a bit of additional dried dill. Carefully cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until serving.
