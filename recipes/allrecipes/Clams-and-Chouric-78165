Place clams in a large pot with enough water to cover. Stir in cornmeal. Let stand for about 20 minutes. Rinse clams thoroughly before cooking. Heat the olive oil and garlic in a large pot over medium heat. When the garlic is fragrant, add the chourico, onion, and red pepper flakes. Cook for 2 or 3 minutes, then pour in about 3/4 of the beer. Let simmer for a few more minutes, then add the clam juice, tomatoes, and rinsed clams. Cover, and simmer until all clams have opened. Season with oregano, salt and pepper before serving. Drink or discard remaining beer.
