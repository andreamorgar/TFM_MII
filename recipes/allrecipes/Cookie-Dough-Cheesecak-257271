Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with parchment paper. Mix graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup melted butter, cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a bowl until well combined and slightly sticky. Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish and firmly press into the bottom. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Beat cream cheese and 1 cup white sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium-low speed until creamy and smooth. Reduce mixer speed to low; add sour cream, lemon juice, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Beat in 3 eggs, 1 at a time, blending well after each addition. Pour cream cheese mixture over crust. Bake in the oven until edges are set and middle is still slightly soft, 30 to 35 minutes. Mix 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour, baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a bowl. Beat 1/2 cup melted butter, brown sugar, 6 tablespoons white sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Beat 1 egg into creamed butter mixture until incorporated; gradually beat into flour mixture until cookie dough is creamy. Fold chocolate chips into cookie dough. Dot cookie dough onto cheesecake; return to the oven and bake until cookie dough is set, 5 to 10 minutes. Cool cheesecake to room temperature, about 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, 3 hours to overnight.
