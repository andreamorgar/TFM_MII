Put oven rack in upper third of oven and preheat oven to 500 degrees F. Stir together bread crumbs, fennel seeds, zest, 1 tablespoon oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl until combined well. Pat steaks dry, then sprinkle all over with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Heat remaining tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy ovenproof skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sear steaks until browned well on bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and turn steaks over with a spatula. Spread top of each steak with 1 teaspoon mustard, then sprinkle evenly with bread crumb mixture. Transfer skillet to oven and roast steaks, without turning over, 5 minutes for medium-rare.
