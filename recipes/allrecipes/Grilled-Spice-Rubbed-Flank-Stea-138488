Mash garlic and ginger to a paste with salt and spices using a mortar and pestle (or mince and mash with a large knife). Pat steak dry, then rub paste all over and marinate steak, covered and chilled, at least 8 hours. Prepare grill for cooking. Bring steak to room temperature (do not leave out longer than 1 hour). When fire is hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack 1 to 2 seconds), grill steak on lightly oiled grill rack 5 to 8 minutes on each side for medium-rare. Transfer steak to a cutting board and let stand 10 minutes. Holding knife at a 45-degree angle, cut steak across the grain into thin slices.
