In a double boiler or microwave oven (on low), melt the chocolate and butter and stir together; set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 cookie sheets. In a large bowl, mix the eggs and sugar on high speed of an electric mixer for 2 to 3 minutes. On low speed, add the melted chocolate mixture and vanilla while mixing. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt; fold into the egg mixture with a large spoon. Stir in the nuts, and let the batter rest for 5 minutes. Drop dough by tablespoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes. Cookies should spring back to touch. Remove cookies to wire rack to cool.
