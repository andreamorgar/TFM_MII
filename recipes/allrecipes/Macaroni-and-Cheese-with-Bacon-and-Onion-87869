Follow the recipe for Creamy Macaroni and Cheese using Vermont white cheddar. Fry bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Pour off all but 3 tablespoons of bacon drippings. Add onions and thyme; saute until soft and golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir bacon and onions into macaroni. Serve hot.
