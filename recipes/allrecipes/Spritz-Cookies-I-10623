Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Cream together the butter and the sugar. Add the 3 beaten egg yolks and one teaspoon of almond extract. Mix until well blended. In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder and salt. Gradually sift into the butter mixture and stir well. Chill until firm (2 - 3 hours).
