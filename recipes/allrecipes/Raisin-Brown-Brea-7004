Combine boiling water, oats, shortening, brown sugar, salt, and molasses. Allow to cool. Stir 1/2 cup warm water and 1 teaspoon white sugar until sugar is dissolved. Sprinkle yeast over this mixture, and proof while oats are cooling. Add 3 cups of warm water to the cooled oat mixture. Stir in yeast. Begin stirring in flour 1 cup at a time until it begins to get hard to stir. Dredge raisins in flour, and mix with cinnamon; mix into the dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface, and knead in enough flour to make a soft but not sticky dough. Cover. Let rise for 1 to 2 hours in a warm place, or until dough doubles in size. Divide dough into 5 parts. Shape loaves, and place into greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pans. Bake in a preheated 375 degree F (190 degree C) oven for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake an additional 20 minutes. Cool on wire racks.
