Mix together the pork, soy sauce, brandy, 1 teaspoon sugar, and cornstarch in a bowl, then cover with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator 4 to 6 hours. Beat the eggs together with the salt, and set aside. Heat half of the oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Pour in the eggs, and cook until they just begin to coagulate, but are still very raw. Remove from the wok and set aside. Heat the remaining vegetable oil in the wok over high heat. Stir in the tomatoes and remaining 1 teaspoon of sugar. Cover, and allow to simmer until the tomatoes have softened, about 7 minutes. Mash the tomatoes until the mixture resembles a chunky soup. Stir in the marinated pork, and cook 3 to 4 minutes until the pork is no longer pink in the center. Gently fold in the eggs and green onions. Continue cooking uncovered 2 minutes more to cook the eggs.
