Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix the flour, sesame seeds and beer until smooth. Roll the beans in the flour mixture to coat. Deep fry the coated beans in small batches until golden brown, about 1 1/2 minutes per batch. Drain on paper towels. Salt to taste. In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, lime juice and sugar to use as a dipping sauce.
