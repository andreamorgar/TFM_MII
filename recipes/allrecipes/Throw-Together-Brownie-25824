Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch brownie pan. In a large bowl, stir together the applesauce, rum, eggs and oil until well blended. Stir in the contents of the brownie mix. Fold in the almonds and chocolate chips. Spread evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until the center is firm. Cool one hour and cut into squares.
