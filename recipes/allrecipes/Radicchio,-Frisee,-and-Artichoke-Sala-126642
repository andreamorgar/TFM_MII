Squeeze juice from 1 lemon half into a large bowl of cold water, then drop same half into water. Cut off stem of 1 artichoke and discard. Cut off top inch of artichoke with a serrated knife. Bend back outer leaves until they snap off close to base, then discard several more layers of leaves in same manner until you reach pale yellow leaves with pale green tips. Cut remaining leaves flush with top of artichoke bottom with a sharp knife, then pull out purple leaves and scoop out fuzzy choke with a melon-ball cutter. Rub cut surfaces with remaining lemon half. Trim remaining dark green fibrous parts from base and sides of artichoke with sharp knife, then rub cut surfaces with same lemon half and drop artichoke into the acidulated water. Repeat with remaining artichokes. Just before serving, slice artichokes paper-thin crosswise with slicer. Immediately toss with frisee and radicchio in a large bowl. Drizzle with oil and toss. Sprinkle with kosher salt and pepper and toss. Drizzle with vinegar (to taste) and toss again.
