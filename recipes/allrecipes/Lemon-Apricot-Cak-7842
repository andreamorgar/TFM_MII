Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease one 10 inch tube or bundt pan. Combine the cake mix, white sugar, 3/4 cup vegetable oil, and apricot nectar together. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 1 hour. Let cake cool in pan for 10 minute then invert onto a serving dish and pour glaze over cake while it is still warm. To Make Glaze: Combine the confectioners' sugar, lemon juice and the 3 drops of oil, mixing until smooth. Use immediately to pour over still warm cake.
