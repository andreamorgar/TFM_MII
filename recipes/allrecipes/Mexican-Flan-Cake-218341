Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray 2 9-inch fluted tube cake pans (such as Bundt(R) pans) with cooking spray. Spread half the cajeta into the bottom of each prepared cake pan. Place sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, 4 eggs, and vanilla extract into a blender, cover the blender, and pulse several times to break up the eggs; blend until thoroughly mixed, about 30 seconds. Pour half the milk mixture into each cake pan. Place the cake mix into a mixing bowl, add the water, vegetable oil, and 3 eggs, and beat with an electric mixer on low speed to combine, about 30 seconds; increase speed to medium, and beat until the cake batter is smooth, about 2 more minutes. Scrape half the cake mix into each pan, on top of the flan ingredients. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven, and flip pans over onto cake serving pans while still hot to remove from pans. Allow to cool before serving.
