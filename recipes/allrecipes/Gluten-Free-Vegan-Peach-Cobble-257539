Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Stir rice flour, almond milk, sucralose sweetener, white sugar, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Spread batter in the prepared baking pan. Arrange peach slices over batter. Dot with vegan margarine. Sprinkle brown sugar evenly over peaches and batter. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes before serving.
