Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease two baking sheets. Whisk sugar, pumpkin, vegetable oil, eggs, milk, and vanilla together in a large bowl until smooth. Stir flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Gradually pour flour mixture into pumpkin mixture; stir to incorporate. Stir chocolate chips into dough. Drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 10 minutes.
