Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a cookie sheet. Cream white sugar, brown sugar, eggs, vegetable oil and vanilla together in a large bowl or dishpan. In a separate bowl combine flour, baking soda and salt. Stir the flour mixture into the creamed sugar; mix until well combined. Stir corn flakes, oats, coconut, pecans, dates and raisins into the dough. You will most likely need to use your hands to mix everything thoroughly. Shape the dough into 1 1/2 to 2 inch balls and press them down lightly onto a greased cookie sheet. Bake in a preheated 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) oven for 10 to 14 minutes or until golden.
