Roll a rolling pin over the bag of potato chips until very fine crumbs form. Heat chocolate chips in a pot over medium-low heat until melted, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove pot from stove and stir in potato chips. Spoon mixture into miniature muffin cups and arrange cups on a baking sheet. Refrigerate until set, about 15 minutes. Store in an air-tight container.
