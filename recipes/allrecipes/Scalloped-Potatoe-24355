Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and place in a 2 quart casserole dish. In a microwave safe dish combine cheese, butter and milk. Microwave until cheese and butter melt; stir in the sherry. Pour cheese mixture over potatoes and sprinkle cornflakes crumbs on top. Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 30 minutes, or until heated through.
