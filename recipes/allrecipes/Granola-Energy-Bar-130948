Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13 inch pan with aluminum foil. Combine the oatmeal, raisins, sunflower seeds, wheat germ, oat bran, flax seeds, cinnamon, and salt in the bowl of a mixer. Mix in peanut butter, honey, and melted butter. Press mixture evenly into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Spread the melted chocolate chips over top; refrigerate until hard, about 30 minutes. Cut into bars.
