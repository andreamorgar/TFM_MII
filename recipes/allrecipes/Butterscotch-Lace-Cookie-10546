Place rolled oats and brown sugar in a bowl. Pour melted butter over oats and stir to combine. Let mixture stand at room temperature overnight so oats absorb butter. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet very well, or line it with greased parchment paper. Mix salt, molasses, flour, egg, and vanilla into oat mixture. Drop level teaspoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheet. Bake only 12 cookies per pan. Bake in preheated oven until edges are brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Allow to remain on sheet a few minutes, until firm, then immediately remove with spatula to cooling rack.
