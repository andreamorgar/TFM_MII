Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onions until golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Add salt, garlic, chile powder, ginger, and turmeric; stir to coat. Mix tomatoes into onion mixture; cook and stir until tomatoes begin to break down, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir rice into onion-tomato mixture and pour in water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.
