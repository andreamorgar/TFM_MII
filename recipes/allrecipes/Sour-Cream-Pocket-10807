Mix together the flour, sour cream and butter or margarine in a large mixing bowl. Flour a pastry board and your hands. Make dough into small balls or roll them into 2 inch squares. Add a small amount of pastry filling, any flavor you like. Fold dough diagonally and press together. If you make balls, press a small rim around the outside so the filling does not seep out. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 minutes and sprinkle on confectioners' sugar. A wonderful gift any time of the year.
