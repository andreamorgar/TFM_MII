In a large skillet, brown sausage over medium heat; drain and set aside. In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, bay leaves, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, basil, oregano, salt, pepper and Italian sausage; mix well. Simmer over medium-low heat for at least one hour; it is best if simmered all day. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Mix sauce with hot pasta; serve.
