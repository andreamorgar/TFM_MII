Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a casserole dish. Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil; partially cook the cauliflower, potatoes, and garlic cloves in the boiling water for 5 to 7 minutes. Drain. Spread into the bottom of the prepared casserole dish; season with salt and pepper. Scatter the peas over the mixture. Set aside. Combine the vegetable stock, butter, and flour together in a small saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer. Slowly stir the milk into the mixture; continue cooking until hot. Slowly add the Swiss cheese to the mixture and allow to melt into the liquid; cook and stir until a cheesy white sauce forms. Season with the curry powder, salt, and pepper. Pour the sauce over the vegetable mixture. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until the vegetables are cooked through and tender, about 20 minutes. Serve hot.
