Pour 1/4 to 1/2 inch of sugar onto a small, shallow plate. Moisten the rim of a margarita glass with a wedge of lemon, dip the moistened glass into the sugar; set aside. Pour the lemon juice, 2 teaspoons of sugar, vodka, and triple sec into a cocktail shaker over ice. Cover, and shake until the outside of the shaker has frosted. Strain into the prepared margarita glass, and serve.
