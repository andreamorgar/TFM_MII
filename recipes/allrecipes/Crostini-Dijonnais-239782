Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat. Stir butter, Dijon mustard, yellow mustard, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until spreadable and smooth. Spread mustard mixture generously onto both sides of each bread slice. Place bread slices on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Flip bread slices and continue baking until golden brown and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes more.
