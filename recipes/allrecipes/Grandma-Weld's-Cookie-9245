Cream the butter and the sugar together until light beat in the flour, almond extract and salt. Stir in the chocolate chips. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill for at least one hour. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Shape the dough into 1 1/2 inch long crescents. Bake on ungreased cookie sheets for 15 to 20 minutes, until cooked through but not browned at all about 10 minutes. Cool cookies on racks and store in an airtight container.
