Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Cream the sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Stir in the egg yolk and vanilla. Mix in flour just until incorporated. Knead dough lightly on a board. Place in a pastry bag using the star design. Cut off desired lengths and shape into rings or S's. Bake 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are golden.
