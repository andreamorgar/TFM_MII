Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, and crumble. In a large bowl, combine broccoli, cheese, bacon and onion. Prepare the dressing in a small bowl by whisking together the red wine vinegar, sugar, pepper, salt, mayonnaise and lemon juice. Combine dressing with salad. Cover, and refrigerate until ready to serve.
