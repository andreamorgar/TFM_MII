Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Mix graham cracker crumbs and melted butter in a bowl; press into an 8-inch springform pan. Combine cream cheese, brown sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a bowl until smooth; stir beer into cream cheese mixture until batter is thin and smooth. Pour batter over graham cracker crust. Bake in the preheated oven until cheesecake is puffed and set in the middle, 40 to 60 minutes. Cool completely. Melt chocolate chips and cream in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Pour over cooled cheesecake. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 hours to overnight.
