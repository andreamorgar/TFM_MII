Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray baking sheets with cooking spray. Whisk egg whites and cream of tartar together in a bowl until foamy. Gradually whisk sugar into egg white mixture until blended. Whisk almond extract and flour into egg white mixture until stiff peaks have formed. The egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape when whisk is held straight up. Fold coconut into egg white mixture until incorporated. Drop spoonfuls of batter onto prepared baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until just golden brown, 8 to 9 minutes. Cool on baking sheets for about 2 minutes; transfer to wire rack to completely cool.
