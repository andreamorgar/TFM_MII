Stir together honey, vinegar, garlic, salt, and pepper and transfer to a sealable plastic bag. Add lamb, then seal bag, pressing out excess air and turning to distribute marinade. Marinate lamb, chilled, turning occasionally, 1 hour. Bring lamb to room temperature. Prepare grill for cooking. If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill and on lid. Remove lamb from marinade, reserving marinade. When fire is medium-hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 3 to 4 seconds), grill lamb on lightly oiled grill rack, turning once, about 4 minutes total for medium-rare. Transfer to a platter and keep warm, covered. Cook tomatoes (still on vine, if using) in disposable roasting pan, covered with grill lid, carefully turning, until softened and just beginning to split, about 8 minutes. Drizzle balsamic vinegar over tomatoes, turning to coat, then cook, uncovered, until vinegar is reduced by about half, about 2 minutes. Remove from grill. Bring reserved marinade with any lamb juices accumulated on platter to a boil in a small heavy saucepan, covered. Drizzle lamb with marinade and serve with tomatoes.
