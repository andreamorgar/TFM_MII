Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir together graham cracker crumbs, flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a mixing bowl; set aside. Beat the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Mix in vanilla. Mix in the flour mixture. Scoop the dough out onto ungreased baking sheets by rounded spoonfuls. Bake in the preheated oven until slightly browned at the edges, 9 to 11 minutes.
