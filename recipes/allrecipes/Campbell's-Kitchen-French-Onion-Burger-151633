Shape the beef into 4 (1/2-inch) thick burgers. Heat a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the burgers and cook until they're well browned on both sides. Remove the burgers and set aside. Pour off any fat. Stir in the soup. Heat to a boil. Return the burgers to the skillet and reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the burgers are cooked through. Top with cheese and continue cooking until the cheese melts. Serve burgers in rolls with soup mixture for dipping.
