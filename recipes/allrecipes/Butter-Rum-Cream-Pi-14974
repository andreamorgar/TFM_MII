In a medium saucepan combine brown sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Whisk in milk and egg yolks until well blended. Cook mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly. Once mixture begins to boil, continue to boil for 2 minutes, then remove from heat. To milk mixture stir in butter or margarine, vanilla extract, butterscotch extract, rum extract, and spiced rum. Pour this mixture into baked pie shell and chill for 2 to 3 hours before serving. Garnish with whipped cream and butterscotch topping.
