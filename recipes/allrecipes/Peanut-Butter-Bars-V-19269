In a large saucepan stir together the brown sugar and corn syrup. Cook over medium heat until the mixture comes to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in the peanut butter and vanilla until smooth. Fold in the cornflakes until they are all evenly coated. Press evenly into a 9x13 inch pan, chill and cut into squares.
