Strain cottage cheese in a sieve fitted over a bowl, pressing down occasionally, until cottage cheese has dried out, about 1 hour. Beat eggs in a medium bowl; add cottage cheese, flour, melted butter, and salt. Mix until just blended. Heat butter in a frying pan over medium-high heat; drop large spoonfuls of batter into the melted butter. Sprinkle blueberries into batter. Cook until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
