Cut pork with the grain into strips 1 1/2- to 2-inches long; put into a large resealable plastic bag. Stir soy sauce, honey, ketchup, brown sugar, rice wine, hoisin sauce, red food coloring, and Chinese five-spice powder together in a saucepan over medium-low heat; cook and stir until just combined and slightly warm, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the marinade into the bag with the pork, squeeze air from the bag, and seal. Turn bag a few times to coat all pork pieces in marinade. Marinate pork in refrigerator, 2 hours to overnight. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove pork from marinade and shake to remove excess liquid. Discard remaining marinade. Cook pork on preheated grill for 20 minutes. Put a small container of water onto the grill and continue cooking, turning the pork regularly, until cooked through, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
