Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a medium bowl, beat together the eggs, sugar, milk, oil and anise extract until smooth. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, salt, baking powder and salt. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour the liquid mixture into it. Mix well until a soft dough is formed. Stir in the extra 1/2 cup of flour if necessary. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls. Place the cookies 2 inches apart onto the cookie sheet, and flatten slightly. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until firm. Cool on wire racks.
