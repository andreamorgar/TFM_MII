Crumble the ground beef into a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until beef is no longer pink. Drain off grease. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in the corn, chili with beans, baked beans, tomato sauce and green chilies. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
