Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper. Blend cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, and taco seasoning together in a bowl; spread into jalapeno halves and arrange onto prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle bread crumbs over the cheese filling. Bake until the peppers are just tender, 20 to 30 minutes.
