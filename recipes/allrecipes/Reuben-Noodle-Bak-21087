Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Toss with half the melted butter and place in a 9x13 baking dish. Spread sauerkraut over the noodles; cover evenly with corned beef. Spread mayonnaise over beef and top with the shredded Swiss and tomato slices. In a small bowl, toss together crushed crackers and caraway seed with remaining melted butter. Sprinkle crumb mixture over Swiss and tomato. Bake in preheated oven 1 hour, until bubbly and golden.
