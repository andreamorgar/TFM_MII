Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray. In a shallow bowl, marinate mushrooms in Italian dressing for 20 minutes. Drain well. In a small mixing bowl, combine crabmeat, 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs, eggs, mayonnaise, onions, and lemon juice. Fill the mushroom caps with the mixture. Arrange the mushrooms on the prepared baking sheet. Top with remaining breadcrumbs. Bake for 15 minutes.
