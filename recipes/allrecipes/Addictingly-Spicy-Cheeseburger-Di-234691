Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Pour mild picante sauce and hot picante sauce over the ground beef; stir. Add processed cheese food and Colby cheese, reduce heat to low, and cook until the cheese is completely melted, about 15 minutes.
