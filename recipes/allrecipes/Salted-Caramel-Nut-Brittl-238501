Line a 15x10x1-inch baking pan with Reynolds Wrap(R) Non-Stick Foil; set aside. Melt the butter in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over medium heat. Stir in sugar, water and corn syrup. Bring to boiling over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Avoid splashing side of saucepan. Clip a candy thermometer to side of pan. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until thermometer registers 290 degrees F or a small amount of mixture dropped into very cold water separates into threads that are hard but not brittle. This will take about 18 minutes. Adjust heat as necessary to maintain a steady boil. Watch carefully the last 5 minutes to prevent overcooking. Remove from heat and remove the thermometer. Pour into the prepared baking pan. Tilt pan to spread mixture evenly. Let stand 2 minutes. In a small bowl combine the cashews, almonds, pumpkin seeds, and sesame seeds. Sprinkle evenly over candy mixture. Set baking pan on a wire rack. Cool completely and break into large pieces to serve.
