Grind the garbanzo beans, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, basil, and Parmesan cheese together in a food processor for 15 seconds. Add about 1/4 of the reserved liquid; grind another 15 seconds. Pour in enough additional reserved liquid, a small amount at a time, and grind; repeat until the consistency is like chunky peanut butter. Pour in the olive oil; grind for an additional 15 seconds. Season with salt and pepper.
