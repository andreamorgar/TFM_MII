Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour one 9 x 13 inch pan. In a large bowl, combine beets, eggs, vanilla, oil, and sugar. Mix with an electric mixer on low speed until well combined. In a separate bowl, mix together flour, soda, salt, and cocoa. Add to the creamed mixture, beating together well. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes until done. Cool and frost with your favorite icing.
