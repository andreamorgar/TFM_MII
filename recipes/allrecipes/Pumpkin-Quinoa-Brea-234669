Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Whisk pumpkin, brown sugar, white sugar, canola oil, and eggs together in a bowl until smooth. Sift flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, baking powder, salt, allspice, and cloves together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture, a little at a time, into pumpkin mixture until batter is smooth; fold in quinoa, walnuts, and cranberries. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until top of loaf springs back when lightly touched, 50 to 60 minutes.
