In a large bowl, stir together sugar and sherry. Add scallops to the bowl, and marinate for 30 minutes. Remove scallops from marinade, and sprinkle with salt. Center a scallop or scallop piece, a slice of water chestnut, and a slice of scallion on a piece of bacon. Wrap, and secure with a toothpick. Arrange on a broiling pan. Place pan under broiler for 10 minutes, turning once, until bacon is golden and cooked.
