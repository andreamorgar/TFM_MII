In a large bowl, sift together the cornmeal, flour, salt, black pepper and red pepper. Pour buttermilk in a separate large bowl. Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Dip the chicken in the buttermilk, then in cornmeal mixture. Coat lightly and cook in hot oil until crispy and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels; keep warm. Combine the rice, red bell peppers, green bell peppers, onion, and chicken in medium bowl. Place lettuce on bottom of 4 servings bowls or plates. Top with rice and chicken mixture. Prepare the dressing by placing the bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. Sprinkle crumbled bacon over chicken mixture. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons drippings. Add 2 tablespoons water, cider vinegar, honey, mustard, salt and pepper; heat just to boiling and pour over salad.
