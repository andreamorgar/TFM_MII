In a small bowl, mix dry bread crumbs and lemon pepper. Place egg substitute in a separate small bowl. Dip catfish pieces in the egg substitute, then into the bread crumb mixture to coat. Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Place coated catfish pieces in the hot oil. Fry on both sides until lightly browned and fish is easily flaked with a fork, about 15 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
