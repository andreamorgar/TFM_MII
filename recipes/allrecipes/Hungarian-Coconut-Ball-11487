Put raisins together with rum extract and lemon juice to soak up the flavor. In a medium bowl, stir together the mashed potatoes, confectioners sugar, and cocoa. Stir in 1 1/4 cup coconut, the raisin mixture and lemon zest. Roll dough into walnut sized balls. Roll the balls in remaining coconut. Refrigerate for two days. ENJOY!
