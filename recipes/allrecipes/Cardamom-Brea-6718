Place all ingredients into bread machine in the proper order for your machine. Use the Dough cycle. At end of the Dough cycle, remove dough from the machine. Place on a lightly floured board, and let it rest, covered, for about 10 minutes. Shape dough into a loaf, and place it in a 9 x 5 inch greased bread pan. Cover, and let rise for 45 minutes. Just before baking, brush the top of the dough with a little milk, and slash a line down the center. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from pan, and cool on a wire rack.
