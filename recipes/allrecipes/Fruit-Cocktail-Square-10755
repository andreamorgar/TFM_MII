Drain the fruit cocktail and reserve 1/3 cup of the syrup. Add the 1 tablespoon maraschino cherry syrup to the reserved fruit cocktail syrup. Chop the drained fruit, and set it aside. Stir together in a bowl the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. In a large bowl, cream together the butter or margarine and sugar. Beat in the egg and vanilla extract. Add the flour mixture, alternating with the syrups, to the creamed mixture. Mix well. Stir in the chopped fruit, the coconut and the cherries. Spread dough into a greased 9 inch square pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 35 minutes. Cool. Sprinkle sifted confectioners' sugar over the top if desired. Cut into squares.
