Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix ground beef with water and milk in a large bowl using your hands until beef is evenly moistened. Mix bread crumbs, onion, carrot, apple, and egg into the beef mixture until evenly integrated. Form the beef mixture into a loaf. Transfer the meatloaf to a deep baking dish; tent with a sheet of aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour; remove foil tent and bake until no longer pink the center, about 30 minutes more.
