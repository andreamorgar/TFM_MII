Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Melt 1 cup butter in a large saucepan. Add 2 cups light brown sugar and beat well to mix. Cool the mixture slightly, then beat in eggs and vanilla. Sift together all-purpose flour, salt and baking powder. Stir it into the wet ingredients, then add the nuts. Mix well. Spread batter in a greased 11 x 7 x 2-inch pan and bake for 30-35 minutes or until a light gold. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out of pan and let brownies finish cooling on a rack. To Make Frosting: Disolve coffee in the water. Cream 1/2 cup butter with confectioner's sugar. Beat it until light. Beat into the sugar mixture. Spread over the brownies. When frosting has set, cut brownies into squares. Enjoy!
