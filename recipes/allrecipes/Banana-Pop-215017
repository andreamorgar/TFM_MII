Place the chocolate chips into a microwave-safe bowl, and microwave on Low until the chips barely melt, about 2 minutes. Stir the melted chips smooth. Place the sprinkles and chopped walnuts into separate shallow bowls. Dip each banana half in melted chocolate, then roll in candy sprinkles and chopped nuts. Place the coated bananas on waxed paper, and freeze until the chocolate hardens, about 5 minutes.
