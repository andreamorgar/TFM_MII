Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat sugar, shortening, and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixture until smooth. Beat eggs, vanilla extract, and almond extract into butter mixture. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture until dough just comes together. Stir almonds, white chocolate chips, and dried cranberries into the dough. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough about 2 inches apart on baking sheets. Bake cookies until bottom edges are light golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool cookies for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
