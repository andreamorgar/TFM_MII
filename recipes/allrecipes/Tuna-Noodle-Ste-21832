Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain leaving about a 1/2 cup of water in the pot. To the pot of pasta, add tuna, celery soup, peas, red bell pepper, onion, and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer until hot. If needed, add more water or milk.
