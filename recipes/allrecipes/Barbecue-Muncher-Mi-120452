In a large roasting pan, combine the cereals, crackers, pretzels and nuts; set aside. In a small saucepan, melt butter; stir in the barbecue sauce, Worcestershire sauce and seasoned salt until blended. Pour over cereal mixture and stir to coat. Bake, uncovered, at 250 degrees F for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes. Spread on waxed paper to cool completely. Store in airtight containers.
