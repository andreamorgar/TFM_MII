Preheat a waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions, and spray with cooking spray. In a shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla extract, sugar, and cinnamon. Dip each piece of white bread into the egg mixture. Cook in the preheated waffle iron until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes.
