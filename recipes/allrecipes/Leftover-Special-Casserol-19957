Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add egg noodles, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until done; drain. Layer noodles, mixed peas and carrots, onions, and ham in prepared baking dish. Mix together soup and milk, then pour mixture over casserole. Season with salt and pepper, then press with the back of a fork to help soup mixture seep through casserole layers. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes, or until bubbly and hot.
