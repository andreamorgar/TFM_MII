Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch baking dish. Mix milk, peanut butter, applesauce, egg, honey, apple, apricots, dates, and nuts together in a large bowl until well-combined. Stir in oats, cinnamon, nutmeg, and baking soda until evenly distributed. Spread mixture into prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before cutting into 12 bars.
