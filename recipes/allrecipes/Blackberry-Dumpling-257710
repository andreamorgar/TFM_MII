Combine blackberries, sugar, butter, and lemon juice in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until blackberries start to break down, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir flour and salt into blackberry mixture; add water until desired consistency is reached. Bring to a simmer. Place tortillas into the simmering blackberry mixture; simmer until tortilla "dumplings" are tender but not soggy, about 5 minutes.
