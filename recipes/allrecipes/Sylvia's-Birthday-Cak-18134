Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch round cake pan. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, soda and salt. Make a well in the center and add eggs, vanilla, oil and water. Mix until smooth. Pour batter into 10 inch round cake pan. Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into cake comes out clean. Allow to cool before frosting.
