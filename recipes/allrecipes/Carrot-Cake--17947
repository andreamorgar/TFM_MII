Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Stir in the wheat germ. Make a well in the center and add sugar, oil, eggs and vanilla. Mix well, then stir in shredded carrots, chopped nuts, coconut and pineapple. Spread batter into a 9x13 inch pan. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until the center springs back when lightly tapped.
