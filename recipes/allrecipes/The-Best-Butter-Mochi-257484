Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan. Mix mochiko, sugar, baking powder, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Whisk eggs and vanilla extract together in a small bowl. Mix eggs into the mochiko mixture. Pour in coconut milk and evaporated milk; mix well. Fold in melted butter until batter is smooth. Pour batter into the greased pan. Tap pan on a flat work surface to settle the batter. Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 50 minutes. Let cool before slicing, about 30 minutes.
