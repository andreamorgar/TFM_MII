Cream together 3/4 cup sugar and butter. Add the milk and vanilla and mix. Sift together the flour, salt, baking powder, and 3 tablespoons cocoa, and add to the mixture. Spread into a greased 9 x 9 inch pan. The batter will be thick. Combine 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1/4 cup cocoa. Sprinkle this over the batter. Finally, pour 1 1/4 cups boiling double strength coffee or water evenly over all. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Serves 6 to 8.
