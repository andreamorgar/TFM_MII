In a saucepan, stir together the sugar, water and vinegar. Bring to a full rolling boil over medium-high heat. Continue to boil for about 15 minutes, or until the mixture turns a deep golden brown, or use a candy thermometer. The temperature should reach 300 degrees F (149 degrees C). Remove from the heat, and pour onto two well buttered heavy dinner plates. When the candy begins to harden, pull from around the edges of the plates. Stretch into long ropes and cut into pieces with kitchen scissors, giving each piece a twist. Cool completely before storing in an airtight tin. Be careful! The candy will be very hot while pulling and cutting.
