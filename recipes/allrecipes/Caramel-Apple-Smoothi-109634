Pour the apple juice into a plastic container and freeze until hard, about 2 hours. Remove from container and break into pieces. Place the frozen juice into the bowl of a blender along with the applesauce, yogurt, 1/4 cup of caramel topping, and peanut butter. Puree until smooth, then pour into 3 glasses; swirl in the remaining tablespoon of caramel topping before serving.
