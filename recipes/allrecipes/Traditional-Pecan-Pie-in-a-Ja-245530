Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread pecans on a baking sheet. Bake pecans in the preheated oven until lightly toasted, 6 to 8 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Bring sugar, light corn syrup, and dark corn syrup to a boil in a saucepan; boil for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Whisk eggs in a large bowl until frothy. Add syrup mixture slowly, whisking constantly to prevent eggs from curdling. Whisk in butter, vanilla extract, and salt until batter is smooth. Spray 8 small jars with cooking spray. Press pieces of pie crust dough into bottom and sides of jars. Add a layer of toasted pecans to each jar. Spoon in batter, leaving 1/4 inch rim at top. Bake in preheated oven until darkened on the top, about 40 minutes. Cool to room temperature before serving.
