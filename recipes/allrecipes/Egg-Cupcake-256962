Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Line 6 cups of a nonstick muffin tin with bacon slices. Chop leftover bacon slices and sprinkle over the bottom of each cup. Whisk eggs, milk, butter, parsley, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Stir in ham and mozzarella cheese. Pour egg mixture into the bacon-lined cups; top with Gouda cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until Gouda cheese is melted and eggs are set, about 15 minutes.
