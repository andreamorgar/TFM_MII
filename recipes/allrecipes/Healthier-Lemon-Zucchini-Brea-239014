Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease 3 mini-loaf pans. Beat zucchini, agave nectar, egg, coconut oil, applesauce, lemon juice, and lemon zest together with an electric mixer in a bowl until smooth. Whisk flour, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, and baking powder together in a bowl; mix into zucchini mixture until batter is just combined. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool bread in pans for 10 minutes before turning onto a wire rack to cool completely.
