Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F(120 degrees C). Combine the flour, sugar and cinnamon together. Add the melted shortening until all is mixed in well. Stir in the anise and knead for 5 minutes. Roll into 1 inch balls and place on an ungreased cookie sheet 2 inches apart. Place a blanched almond on top of each cookie and push down slightly. Bake at 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) for 30 minutes. You do no want to brown the cookies. They should remain pale. Let cookies cool on cookie sheet for 30 minutes.
