Do not preheat oven. Spray a 10 inch Bundt pan with vegetable oil spray. Sift together flour, soda and salt and set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, sugar and cream cheese until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing thoroughly after each addition. Pour the flour mixture into the batter and gently fold in with a spatula. Stir in the vanilla, lemon and orange flavoring. Batter will be very thick. Pour batter into prepared 10 inch Bundt pan. Place cake in oven and set thermostat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake for 60 to 70 minutes or until the top is golden brown and then turn the oven off. Let the cake sit in the oven for an additional 15 minutes. Remove from oven and cool in pan for 15 minutes. Turn cake over onto a cake plate and allow to cool while covered.
