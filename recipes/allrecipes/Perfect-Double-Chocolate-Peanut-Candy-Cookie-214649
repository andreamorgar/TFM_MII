Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. In a large bowl, beat the butter and shortening together with an electric mixer until well combined. Beat in the white and brown sugar until the mixture is creamy, then beat the vanilla extract and eggs, followed by the cocoa powder. Beat until the mixture is even in color. In another bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt; stir the flour mixture into the cocoa mixture until the dough is thoroughly mixed. Stir in the chocolate chips and 3/4 cup of peanut butter candies. Reserve the rest of the candy pieces. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate the cookie dough until chilled, at least 45 minutes. Drop dough by tablespoon onto the prepared baking sheets. Gently press a few more candy pieces into the top of each cookie. Bake in the preheated oven 8 to 9 minutes; cool on baking sheets for 1 to 2 minutes before finishing cooling on racks.
