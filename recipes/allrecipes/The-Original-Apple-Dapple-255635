Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 16 individual muffin cups with cooking spray. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Split biscuits in half. Place 1 half in each muffin cup; press biscuit dough to cover the bottom and sides of each cup. Place apple pie filling in a bowl; cut up larger pieces of apples. Mix in vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Divide filling among dough-lined cups. Combine remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, flour, brown sugar, and nutmeg in a bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry cutter until mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle over pie filling and gently press down. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown and filling is bubbly, about 13 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet. Carefully transfer to serving plates; cool for 5 minutes more. Top with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of caramel topping.
