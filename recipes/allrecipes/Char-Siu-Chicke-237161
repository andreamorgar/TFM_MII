Whisk brown sugar, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, honey, garlic, sriracha sauce, sherry, food coloring, sesame oil, Chinese five-spice powder, and liquid smoke together in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken thighs, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a roasting pan with aluminum foil and place a roasting rack in the bottom of the pan. Remove chicken from marinade and place on the rack in the prepared roasting pan. Pour marinade into a saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Bake chicken in the preheated oven, turning once and basting occasionally with marinade, until the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
