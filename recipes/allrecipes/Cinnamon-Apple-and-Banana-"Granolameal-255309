Place apple, bananas, granola, cinnamon, sugar, and cocoa powder in a container with a lid. Cover and shake until combined. Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add apple mixture; increase heat slightly and cook, stirring constantly, until cinnamon starts to darken and turn into a paste, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in milk. Reduce heat to medium; cook, covered, until flavors combine, about 1 minute. Uncover and stir. Cover and simmer for 1 minute more. Remove from heat and stir.
