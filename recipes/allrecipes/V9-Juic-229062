Cook tomatoes in a large stock pot over medium heat until tender, about 20 minutes. Juice carrots, peas, onions, cabbage, spinach, red and green bell peppers, broccoli, acorn squash, celery, and garlic in a vegetable juicer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stir the juice and vegetable pulp into the tomatoes and bring mixture to a boil. Mix in lemon juice, sea salt, and black pepper, stirring to dissolve salt. Process the mixture through a food mill to strain out all seeds, skins, and pulp. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the vegetable juice into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 15 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.
