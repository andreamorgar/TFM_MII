Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl combine the chicken, salt and pepper, rice, soup, mushrooms, celery, onion, almonds and mayonnaise. Mix well and spread mixture into an ungreased 9x13 inch baking dish. Spread a generous layer of butter or margarine onto one side of each slice of bread, then tear bread into small pieces and place on top of chicken mixture to form a top 'crust'. Place baking dish on center oven rack and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 30 minutes, or until crust is crisp and golden and mixture is bubbly around the edges.
