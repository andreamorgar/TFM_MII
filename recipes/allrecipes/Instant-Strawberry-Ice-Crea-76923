Place berries in blender. Whisk sugar into cream. With blender going, slowly add cream through opening in lid, stopping to stir the mixture 3 or 4 times so the ice cream is smooth, with small bits of berries. Transfer to shallow pan and freeze to a scoopable texture, about 2 hours. Garnish with fresh strawberries, if you like.
