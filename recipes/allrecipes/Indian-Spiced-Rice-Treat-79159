In a large bowl, toss together the cereal, cashew nuts and raisins. Melt the butter in a large pan over medium heat. Stir in the marshmallows and cardamom until smooth. Pour in the cereal mixture, and stir until evenly coated. Spread evenly in a greased baking dish, and pat down lightly. Cool, and cut into squares.
