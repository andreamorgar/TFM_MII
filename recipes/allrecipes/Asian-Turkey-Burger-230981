Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Mix ground turkey, onion, water chestnuts, bell pepper, garlic, parsley, soy sauce, water, ginger, salt, and pepper in a bowl; shape into 4 patties. Cook the turkey burgers on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
