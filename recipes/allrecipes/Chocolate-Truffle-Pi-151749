Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grate 1 square of the chocolate; set aside. Place remaining 10 chocolate squares in large microwaveable bowl. Add cream. Microwave on HIGH 2 min. or until chocolate is almost melted. Stir until chocolate is completely melted; cool slightly. Add eggs, sugar and flour; beat with wire whisk until well blended. Pour into lightly greased 9-inch pie plate. Bake 35 min. or until outer half of pie is puffed and center is slightly soft; cool. Top each slice with a dollop of whipped topping just before serving. Sprinkle evenly with the grated chocolate.
