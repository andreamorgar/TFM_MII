Heat bacon grease in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Saute onion in hot grease until soft, about 4 minutes. Stir potato chunks with the onion. Pour chicken broth and water over the potato mixture. Bring the liquid to a boil and cook until the potatoes are tender but not mushy, about 15 minutes. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir flour into the butter and cook, stirring constantly, until completely moistened, about 1 minute. Pour milk into the saucepan while continuing to stir; cook until thickened, about 3 minutes more. Sprinkle cheese over the milk mixture; cook and stir until the cheese is melted smoothly into the mixture, 2 to 3 minutes more. Stir the cheese mixture and cooked chicken into the liquid in the stockpot; cook just until the chicken is heated through, about 4 minutes.
