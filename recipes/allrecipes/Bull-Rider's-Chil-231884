Saute garlic, onion and peppers in olive oil until onions are transparent. Add meat and brown. Stir in tomatoes and once mixture is very hot, add the packages of potatoes. Mix thoroughly, add beans and simmer for at least one hour on medium heat. Gather up your own buckaroos and serve the chili topped with a large dollop of Fiesta Dip.
