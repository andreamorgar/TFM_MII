Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter two baking sheets. Beat butter and sugar together in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; beat in eggs and vanilla extract until smooth. Stir in zucchini. Whisk flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a separate bowl. Mix flour mixture into butter-zucchini mixture. Fold in coconut, walnuts, chocolate chips, and raisins. Drop batter, about 1 tablespoon per cookie, onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake cookies in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.
