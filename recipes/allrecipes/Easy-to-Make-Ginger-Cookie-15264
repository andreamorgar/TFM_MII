In a medium bowl, cream together the shortening and confectioners' sugar. Stir in the egg. Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt, stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, stir in the ginger. Cover the dough, and refrigerate for at least a 1/2 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees c). Dust a clean, dry surface with corn starch. Roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thickness, and cut out cookies with the cutter of your choice. Place cookies 1 1/2 inches apart on unprepared cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until cookies are slightly brown at the edges. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks.
