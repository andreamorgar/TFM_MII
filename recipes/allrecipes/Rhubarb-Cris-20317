Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and lightly grease a 2 quart baking dish. In a large bowl, combine rhubarb, sugar, oats, 1 teaspoon flour, cinnamon and brown sugar. Stir until well combined and pour into prepared baking dish. In small bowl, stir together 3/4 cup flour, baking soda and salt. Blend in margarine until all flour is incorporated. Sprinkle over rhubarb mixture. Bake 30 minutes, or until rhubarb is tender.
