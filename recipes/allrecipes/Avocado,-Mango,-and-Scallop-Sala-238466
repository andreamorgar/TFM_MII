Fill a skillet with water to about 1/2-inch depth and bring to a boil; cook scallops until tender and cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain water and allow scallops to cool to room temperature. Place scallops in a bowl and coat with olive oil and season with salt. Break leaves off cilantro and chop the stalks into about 1-inch pieces. Mix leaves and stalks together in a bowl. Sprinkle 1/2 of the cilantro mixture onto a serving plate. Combine mangos, red bell pepper, and olives in a bowl; spread over the cilantro on the serving platter. Mix remaining cilantro with scallops and arrange on top of the mango mixture. Fan the avocado slices around the outside of the serving plate. Spoon lemon juice over avocado slices.
