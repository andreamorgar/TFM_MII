In a bowl, combine biscuit and cake mixes. Stir in water just until moistened. Turn onto a floured surface; knead 10-12 times. Pat into a greased 9-in. square baking pan. Score the surface, making nine squares. Bake at 425 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. Break biscuits apart at score marks.
