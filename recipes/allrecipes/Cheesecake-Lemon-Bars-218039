Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly butter a 9x13-inch baking dish. Whisk together 1 1/2 cup flour and confectioners' sugar in a mixing bowl. Cut in the cold butter with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of the prepared baking dish to form a crust. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Remove from oven, and set aside. Whisk together 4 eggs, 1 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon flour, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a bowl. Pour lemon mixture into the prepared crust. Skim off any bubbles from the surface of the filling. Mix the cream cheese and 1 cup sugar in a bowl until well blended. Whisk in 2 eggs, then spread over the lemon mixture. The mixtures will separate during baking. Bake in the preheated oven until the filling is set, about 30 minutes.
