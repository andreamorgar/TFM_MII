Wrap each hot dog with a strip of bacon; secure with a toothpick. Refrigerate wrapped hot dogs while heating oil. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry hot dogs in batches in the preheated oil until bacon is crispy and browned, 2 to 5 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Serve hot dogs in toasted buns.
