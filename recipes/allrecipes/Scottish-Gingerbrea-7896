Stir together the flours, spices, and baking soda. In a large bowl, cream the butter or margarine with the sugar and molasses. Beat in the eggs, then the beer. Beat the flour mixture into the creamed mixture. Stir in the raisins, orange peel, and almonds. Turn the batter into a greased and floured 9 x 13 inch baking pan. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 40 minutes, or until done. Transfer to a rack to cool.
