Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Beat butter and sugar in a bowl until creamy. Stir in flour, vanilla extract, baking powder, and baking soda until dough is well mixed. Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes.
