Steam or boil broccoli florets until very tender. Drain if necessary and mash or puree until you have your desired consistency. Let cool, then place in a sealed container in the fridge until ready to use. Whisk egg. Whisk in 1/4 cup (60 mL) broccoli puree and breast milk or formula until well combined. Heat a pan over medium heat. Add egg and broccoli mixture and cook, stirring often, until eggs are scrambled and completely cooked through. Remove from heat, let cool and chop into tiny pieces that your baby can manage.
