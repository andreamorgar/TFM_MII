Place wings in a nonporous glass dish or bowl. Blend onions, 4 cloves garlic and 1 slice ginger in a blender, adding water as needed to dilute; rub this mixture into the chicken pieces. In a small bowl, combine the sesame seeds, sesame oil, soy sauce, wine, oyster sauce, lemon juice, honey and salt. Mix well, then stir in 1 slice ginger, 4 cloves garlic and ground peppercorns. Add mixture to chicken and turn to coat; cover dish and refrigerate to marinate for about 30 minutes. Heat oil in a deep skillet or deep fryer; fry chicken in hot oil for about 10 to 15 minutes, or until cooked through and juices run clear.
