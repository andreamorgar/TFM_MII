Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). With an electric mixer beat the cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Pour filling into the crust. Chop frozen Junior Mints and sprinkle over top of filling. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 40 to 45 minutes or until just set. Cool on wire rack, then chill for several hours or overnight. Serves about 8.
