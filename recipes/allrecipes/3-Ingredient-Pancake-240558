Mash banana in a bowl using a fork; add eggs, baking powder, and cinnamon and mix batter well. Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat. Spoon batter into the hot butter and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
