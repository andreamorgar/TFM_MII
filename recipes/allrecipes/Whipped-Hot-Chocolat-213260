Heat milk in a small saucepan over low heat until the milk begins to steam. Whisk in the sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla extract, and salt until dissolved. Stir in the chocolate until melted. Remove saucepan from heat, and allow to cool slightly. Beat the heavy cream in large mixing bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the hot chocolate. Serve immediately.
