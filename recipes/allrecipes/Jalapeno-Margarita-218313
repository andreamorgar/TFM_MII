Pour 1/4 to 1/2 inch of salt onto a small, shallow plate. Moisten the rim of two margarita glasses with water and dip into the salt. Fill with ice, and set aside. Pour the tequila, triple sec, lime juice, agave nectar, and jalapeno into a cocktail shaker over ice. Cover, and shake vigorously until the outside of the shaker has frosted. Strain into the prepared glasses, and garnish with lime wedges to serve.
