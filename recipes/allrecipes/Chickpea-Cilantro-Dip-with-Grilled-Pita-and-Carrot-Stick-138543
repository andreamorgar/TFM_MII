Prepare grill for cooking. If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill and on lid. Slip skins from chickpeas with your fingers, then puree chickpeas with yogurt, cilantro, garlic, lemon juice, water, and salt in a food processor until smooth. When fire is hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 1 to 2 seconds), grill pitas on lightly oiled grill rack, uncovered, turning once, until golden, about 2 minutes total. Serve dip with pitas and carrots.
