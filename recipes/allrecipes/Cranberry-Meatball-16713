Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray two cookie sheets with non-stick cooking spray. In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine eggs, cornflake crumbs, chili sauce, soy sauce, parsley flakes, dehydrated onion, vegetable burger, buttery round crackers, cream cheese, and walnuts. Shape into 72 1-inch meatballs. Arrange on prepared cookie sheets. Bake the meatballs at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through. In a large saucepan, combine cranberry sauce, Russian dressing, brown sugar, and lemon juice. Cook, stirring frequently until the cranberry sauce is melted. Add the meatballs and heat through. Serve with appetizer toothpicks, if desired.
