Soak rice in hot tap water in a large bowl while preparing meat mixture. While rice soaks, put a metal steamer rack in a deep 12-inch skillet or a wide 6-quart pot and add enough water to reach 1/2 inch below bottom of steamer rack. Remove steamer rack from skillet and line rack with lettuce. Stir together remaining ingredients (except rice) until combined well. Drain rice in a sieve and transfer to a shallow dish. Roll about 1 tablespoon meat mixture into a ball and roll in rice to coat, then transfer to steamer rack. Make about 30 more coated balls in same manner (use all of meat mixture; there will be leftover rice) and arrange in 1 layer on steamer rack. Bring water to a boil and set steamer rack in skillet. Cover tightly and steam over high heat until cooked through, about 25 minutes. Check water occasionally, adding more as necessary.
