Stir the mixture well and let it cool to lukewarm. While the liquid mixture is cooling, mix flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, vanilla, and eggs into the butterscotch mixture; mix well. Fold in marshmallows and chocolate morsels. Spread batter into a lightly greased 9x13 inch pan. Bake 25 minutes. Be careful not to overcook.
