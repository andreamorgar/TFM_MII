Stir flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper together in a bowl. Sprinkle pieces of steak with flour mixture and pound the flour mixture into the meat with a meat mallet or the edge of a sturdy plate. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook the floured beef in the hot oil until browned on both sides, about 15 minutes. Reduce heat to low, pour in water, cover skillet, and simmer beef until tender, about 1 hour. Add more water to the skillet if needed to prevent burning. Mix diced tomatoes, green bell pepper, onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon black pepper in a bowl. Pour tomato mixture over beef, bring to a simmer, and cook until sauce has thickened, about 30 more minutes.
