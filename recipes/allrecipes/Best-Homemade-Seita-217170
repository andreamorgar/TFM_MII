Combine the vital wheat gluten flour and nutritional yeast flakes in a bowl; set aside. In a separate bowl, mix the vegetable stock, 1/2 cup of soy sauce, tomato paste, garlic, lemon zest, and seasoning blend. Pour the wet ingredients into the flour mixture and stir with a firm spatula. Knead the dough until a spongy, elastic dough forms, about 3 minutes. Roll the dough into a log shape and cut it into 3 equal pieces. Combine 1/2 cup of soy sauce and cold water in a large pot. The simmering broth should be very cold when you add the dough to help it keep a firm texture and ensure that it doesn't break apart. Place the dough pieces in the cold broth, partially cover the pot, and bring it to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, partially cover the pot, and simmer for 1 hour, turning the dough pieces occasionally. Remove the pot from the heat and let the gluten cool in the broth for at least 30 minutes. To store the gluten, refrigerate, covered in the broth, in a sealed container for up to 5 days. If your recipe calls for seitan, cut the gluten into pieces. Add vegetable oil to a heavy skillet and turn the heat to medium-high. Add the gluten pieces and cook for 20 minutes, turning the pieces occasionally.
