Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan with parchment paper. Arrange tart shells onto prepared pan. Put a piece of Brie cheese into each shell. Sprinkle diced pear and a couple thyme leaves into each shell and drizzle with honey. Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and tarts are golden, 12 to 15 minutes.
