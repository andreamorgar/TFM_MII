Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over low heat. Cook the bacon in the oil until it just begins to crisp. Stir in the onion. Cook and stir until bacon is crisp and onion is soft. Stir in the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Remove the bacon mixture from the pan and reserve. Brown the ground beef in the saucepan; drain. Stir the bacon mixture, crushed tomatoes, and tomato sauce into the beef. Season with salt to taste. Simmer over low heat while pasta is cooking. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Stir in the shell pasta, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta until cooked through but still firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain. Toss hot pasta with bacon and beef sauce to serve.
