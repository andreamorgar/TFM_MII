Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Arrange tomatoes, peach, onion, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, and garlic on a baking sheet. Broil in the preheated oven until vegetables and peach are browned and tender and tomato skins can be peeled off, 10 to 15 minutes. Dice the roasted vegetable and peach and transfer to a bowl. Add lemon juice, sugar, salt, and parsley; toss to coat. Refrigerate at least 1 hour for flavors to blend.
