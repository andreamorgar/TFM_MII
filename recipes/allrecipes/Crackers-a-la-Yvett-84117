Unwrap the crackers, and place them all into a 1 gallon size glass jar with a tight fitting lid. In a small bowl, stir together the canola oil, red pepper flakes, and ranch dressing mix. Pour over the crackers in the jar. Close the lid tightly, and roll the jar every 5 minutes for about 1 hour to coat with the spice mixture. The longer these sit, the better they get!
