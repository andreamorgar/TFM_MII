Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets and lightly dust with cornstarch. In a medium bowl, stir together the coconut, sugar and cornstarch. Add the egg and salt, mix until well blended. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheet. Bake for 13 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. When cool, drizzle with melted chocolate.
