Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine chili powder, paprika, brown sugar, mustard powder, seasoned salt, black pepper, curry powder, garlic powder, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper in a container with a lid. Seal container and shake until rub is well combined. Generously coat ribs with rub and place in a roasting pan. Loosely cover pan with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour 30 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Transfer ribs to grill. Cook ribs on the preheated grill until browned, 5 to 10 minutes per side.
