Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Combine the flour and sugar in the pie shell, and mix together using your fingers. Pour in milk, and again, mix with your fingers to avoid damaging the crust. Dribble in the molasses, and dot with butter. Sprinkle cinnamon over the top. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, then turn the oven down to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the filling is set, and the top is browned.
