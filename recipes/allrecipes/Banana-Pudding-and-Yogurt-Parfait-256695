Place banana slices in a bowl; toss with lemon juice to prevent browning. Whisk heavy cream, Greek yogurt, and vanilla pudding mix together in a bowl until pudding is thick and smooth. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons crushed cookies in the bottom of four 8-ounce clear drinking glasses. Cover cookies with 2 to 3 tablespoons pudding mixture and 3 to 4 banana slices. Repeat layers twice more.
