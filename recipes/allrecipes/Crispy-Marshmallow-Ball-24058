Line trays with waxed paper. Pour rice cereal into a shallow dish or bowl. In a double boiler, combine condensed milk, margarine and caramels. Cook, stirring, over simmering water, until melted and smooth. Using tongs or two forks, dip marshmallows one at a time into caramel mixture, then roll in rice cereal. Place on waxed paper until set.
