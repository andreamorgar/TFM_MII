Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare an 8-inch square baking dish with cooking spray. Spread oats into the prepared baking dish. Beat milk, eggs, brown sugar, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt together in a large bowl until smooth; pour over oats. Bake in preheated oven until oats are softened and mixture thickened, 50 to 55 minutes.
