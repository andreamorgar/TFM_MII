Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch baking dish. Mix brownie mix, cocoa powder, brown sugar, confectioners' sugar, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger together in a bowl. Stir butter and coffee together in a bowl; allow to cool for 5 minutes. Stir sour cream and vanilla extract into butter mixture; stir into brownie mix mixture and add egg. Stir 25 times with a wooden spoon until batter is smooth; fold in chocolate chips and stir 25 more times. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until edges start to pull away from the sides, 20 to 30 minutes. Cool brownies before cutting.
