Crush 9 cookies finely; mix with cream cheese until blended. Shape into 15 balls. Place remaining cookies on waxed paper-covered rimmed baking sheet. Dip balls in chocolate; place on cookies. Tap cookies on baking sheet several times to allow excess chocolate to pool onto tops of cookies. Decorate with gels to resemble snowmen. Refrigerate 1 hour or until firm.
