In a large saucepan, combine pie filling, pineapple with juice, food coloring, sugar, and cornstarch. Cook over low heat until thick, stirring frequently. Remove from heat and stir in gelatin. Allow mixture to cool, then stir in banana slices. Pour half of mixture into each pastry shell. Top with whipped topping if desired. Chill at least four hours before serving.
