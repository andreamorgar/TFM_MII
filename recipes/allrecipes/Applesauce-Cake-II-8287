In a large bowl, cream the sugar and shortening until fluffy. Add applesauce and molasses and mix in. Gradually add the flour mixture and beat well to moisten. Fold in the raisins. Pour into a prepared fluted or straight sided tube pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes, or until toothpick inserted into the middle of cake comes out clean. Cake will not rise to top of pan. Cool for 10 minutes and remove from pan and cool on wire rack.
