Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour three 9 inch round cake pans. Cream together butter, 2 cups sugar, eggs, and vanilla. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Add flour mixture alternately with milk into egg mixture. Divide batter into 3 parts. Fill two pans with plain batter. Add spices, raisins, and nuts into remaining batter, and pour batter into third pan. Bake for 25 minutes, or until done. Cool layers on wire racks.
