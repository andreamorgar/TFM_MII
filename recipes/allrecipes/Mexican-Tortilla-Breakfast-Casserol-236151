Cook sausages according to package directions; cut into 1/4-inch slices; set aside. In a skillet, saute onion and bell pepper in oil until almost tender. Stir in garlic and chili pepper; cook for 1 additional minute. Add sausage and chilies; set aside. In a bowl, combine cheeses, green onion and cilantro. In a greased, 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish, sprinkle one third of tortilla chips. Follow with one-half of the sausage mixture and one-half of the cheese mixture; repeat. In a bowl, beat eggs, milk, salt and pepper sauce; pour over layered ingredients. Sprinkle with remaining tortilla chips. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 45 to 50 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting.
