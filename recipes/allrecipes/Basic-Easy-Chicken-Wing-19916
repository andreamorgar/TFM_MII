Preheat grill for high heat. Lightly oil the grill grate. Cook the wings 8 to 12 minutes on each side, until juices run clear. The larger pieces will take slightly longer to cook. Melt the butter in a saucepan, and mix in the hot sauce, cayenne pepper, and black pepper. Place wings in a large container with a secure lid. Pour sauce over the wings, and seal. Shake wings with the sauce until thoroughly coated.
