Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll the cookie dough to 1/4 inch thick and form it into a heart shape. Place the heart shape on a cookie sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 minutes, or until the cookie is lightly brown on the edges. In a large mixing bowl, mix cream cheese with confectioner's sugar. Spread the mixture on cooled cookie dough. Cover with cherry pie filling and whipped cream.
