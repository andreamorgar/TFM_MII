Spread cream cheese in an even layer on a serving dish or in the bottom of a glass pie pan. Combine shrimp with cocktail sauce in a bowl and spread evenly over the cream cheese layer. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese, covering the shrimp layer as completely as possible. Sprinkle the red and green bell pepper over the cheese layer. Serve with crackers.
