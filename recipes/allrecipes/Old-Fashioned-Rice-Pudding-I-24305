Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). In a 1 quart baking dish combine rice, salt and sugar. Stir in scalded milk and dot with butter. Bake in preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours, or until rice is very tender and milk is thick and creamy. Stir gently with a fork every 15 minutes during the first hour.
