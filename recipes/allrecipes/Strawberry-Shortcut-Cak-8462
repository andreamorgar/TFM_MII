Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease bottom only of a 9x13 inch baking pan. Sprinkle the marshmallows evenly over bottom of pan. Thoroughly combine completely thawed strawberries and their syrup with dry gelatin; set aside. In large mixing bowl, mix flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Make a well in the center and add shortening, milk, vanilla and eggs. Blend at low speed until moistened, then beat 3 minutes at medium speed, scraping sides of bowl occasionally. Pour batter evenly over marshmallows in pan. Spoon strawberry mixture evenly over batter. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes until golden brown and toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean.
