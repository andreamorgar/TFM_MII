Place all ingredients (except the milk) into the bread machine pan in the above order, or as directed by the manufacturer. Select the Basic Bread setting; press Start. After the baking cycle is complete, remove the bread from the pan and brush the just baked bread with milk. This will give it a soft and shiny crust.
