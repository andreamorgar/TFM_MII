Fill the core of the apple with the brown sugar and cinnamon. Wrap the apple in a large piece of heavy foil, twisting the extra foil into a tail for a handle. Place the apple in the coals of a campfire or barbeque and let cook 5 to 10 minutes, until softened. Remove and unwrap, being careful of the hot sugar.
