Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In large bowl beat flour, oats, butter, wheat germ, orange peel and 1/2 cup of packed brown sugar at low speed until just mixed. Beat at medium speed for 2 minutes (mixture will look dry). With lightly floured hands, shape mixture into a ball, then pat into 8" by 8" baking pan. In a small bowl, beat eggs with a 1/4 cup of packed brown sugar, stir in almonds and coconut. Pour evenly over mixture in pan. Bake 35 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean. Cool in pan on rack.
