Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix cream cheese, chicken, buffalo wing sauce, ranch dressing, and sour cream together in a large bowl; transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Evenly sprinkle Colby-Monterey Jack cheese over dip. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve with tortilla chips.
