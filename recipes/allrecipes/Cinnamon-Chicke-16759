Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle evenly with ground cinnamon, seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper. (Note: You can be liberal with the seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper; however, the cinnamon should only be a dusting and not clumped.) Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 30 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
