Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a large bowl combine the beef, dry soup mix, bouillon, onion and soup. Mix all together and pour mixture into a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 4 hours. Add mushrooms and wine and bake for another 10 minutes. Add cooked egg noodles and mix all together. Serve with fresh bread and a green salad, if desired.
