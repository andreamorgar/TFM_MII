Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Sift together the dry ingredients (GF flour through salt) and set aside. Make the chia seed mixture and set aside.* Mix all remaining liquid ingredients together (water through vanilla extract). Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients while stirring rapidly, and then add the chia seed mixture and chocolate chips. Allow batter to rest for 15 minutes.
