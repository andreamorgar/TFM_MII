Whisk sweetened condensed milk and lemon juice together in a bowl; gently fold in raspberries. Gently spread cream cheese onto the bottom and sides of graham cracker crusts using a spatula. Divide raspberry mixture between the two crusts; spread filling evenly within the crust. Refrigerate until set, at least 3 hours.
