Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8 inch square pan. Whisk together 3/4 cup white sugar, flour, baking powder, and salt. Add in melted chocolate, butter or margarine, vanilla, and milk; mix to combine. Pour batter into prepared pan. Sprinkle with the two sugars, 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white, and the cocoa. Pour cold coffee over the top, but do not stir in. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Serve warm.
