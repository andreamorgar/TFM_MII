Thaw out frozen bread dough; cut each roll into 3 pieces and set aside. Brown beef and cabbage in a large skillet, seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll out bread dough and cut into squares. Place a spoonful of the beef/cabbage mixture onto the center of each dough square. Sprinkle cheese on top, fold over and pinch sides to seal. Rub a bit of oil on the outside of each pastry. Place in a 9x13 inch baking dish and bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 60 minutes, or until golden brown.
