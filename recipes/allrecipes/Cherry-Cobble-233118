Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line the inside of a Dutch oven with aluminum foil. Spread cherry pie filling in an even layer into the bottom of the Dutch oven. Sprinkle cake mix over the pie filling; top with a layer of brown sugar. Dot the top with butter pieces. Put lid on the Dutch oven. Bake in preheated oven until the top is golden brown, 45 to 90 minutes.
