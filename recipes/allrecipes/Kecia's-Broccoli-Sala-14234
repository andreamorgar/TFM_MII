Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside to cool. In a large bowl toss the broccoli florets, bacon, green onions, raisins and peanuts together. In a small bowl whisk the vinegar, sugar and mayonnaise together. Pour half of the dressing over the broccoli mixture and refrigerate. Let marinate overnight. Just before serving top with remaining dressing.
