Sprinkle in water (1 tablespoon at a time) tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl. 1 to 2 teaspoons more of water can be added, if necessary. Gather pastry into ball. Shape into flattened round on lightly floured cloth-covered board. Roll pastry 2 inch larger than inverted 9x1-1/4 inch pie plate. Fold pastry into quarters. Place in plate.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In large bowl, beat eggs until foamy. Add 1/2 cup flour and brown and white sugars. Beat until well-blended. Blend in butter. Stir in chocolate morsels and walnuts. Pour into the pastry-lined pie plate. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) until set, about 1 hour. Serve warm with whipped cream or ice cream.
