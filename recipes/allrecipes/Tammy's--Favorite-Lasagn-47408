Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute onions until soft. Stir in ground beef, and cook until evenly brown. Drain excess fat. Season with Italian seasoning, rosemary, garlic salt, salt and pepper. Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste and water. Simmer 1 hour, or until sauce has thickened. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook onion until soft and translucent. Stir in flour until smooth. Stir in Parmesan cheese, then milk. Cook, stirring, until thick. Allow to cool, then stir in egg. (Sauce will be very thick.) Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
