Combine sweetened condensed milk, whole milk, evaporated milk, heavy cream, maple flavoring, and sugar in a large bowl. Stir thoroughly, being careful to avoid creating a bubbly foam. Chill milk mixture in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Pour chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions, about 30 minutes. Spoon ice cream into an airtight container; fold in chopped walnuts. Cover with plastic wrap and seal with lid. Freeze until solid, at least 2 hours.
