In a small bowl, whisk together the condensed milk, mayonnaise, sugar, vinegar, and honey until combined into a sauce; set aside. Combine the diced chicken and beaten eggs in a bowl and set aside. Spread the flour in a shallow dish. Dredge the chicken pieces in the flour until evenly coated. Heat the canola oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken in the heated oil for about 2 minutes, turning occasionally to brown evenly. Stir in the sauce until the chicken is completely coated. Cook and stir until chicken is golden brown on the outside and no longer pink inside, 12 to 15 minutes.
