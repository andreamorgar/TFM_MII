In a large mixing bowl beat shortening and butter until softened. Add the 3/4 cup sugar and beat until fluffy. Add milk, egg and 1 tsp of the vanilla and mix well. In a separate bowl combine flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt. Add to the butter mixture and beat until well mixed. Divide dough in half and chill 2-3 hours or until easy to handle. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease cookie sheets. Mix softened cream cheese, 1/3 cup sugar and 1 tsp vanilla until smooth. Stir in the coconut. Roll each half of the dough into a 10-inch square. Cut each square into sixteen 2 1/2-inch squares. Place 1/2 inch apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. Cut 1-inch slits from each corner to center of square. Drop a level tsp of the coconut mixture onto each center. Sprinkle chopped nuts in the center and firmly press to seal. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until edges are firm and cookies are slightly puffed. Cool on cookie sheet for 1 minute, then remove and cool thoroughly on rack.
