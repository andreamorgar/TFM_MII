Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large skillet, brown the ground beef and the sausage together. Drain all the fat. Over low heat, add the cheese and the oregano into the meat in the skillet. When the cheese is melted and all is mixed well, spread the mixture on slices of the party rye. Arrange the pieces on cookie sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 5 to 10 minutes, until just browned.
