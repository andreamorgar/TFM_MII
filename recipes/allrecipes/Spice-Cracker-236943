Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix flour, wheat germ, sugar, ginger, mustard, cinnamon, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Cut butter into the flour mixture with a pastry blender until the crumbles are the size of small peas. Slowly add water to dough and stir with a fork until the mixture comes together to form a ball. Turn the dough ball onto a lightly floured surface and roll to about 1/4-inch thick; cut into small circles using a circular cookie cutter or a small, round glass. Put circles onto a baking sheet with 2 inches between. Bake in the oven or until nicely browned, about 10 minutes.
