Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans. Beat sugar, oil, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth; fold in zucchini. Stir flour, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, nutmeg, baking powder, and cloves together in a separate bowl; gradually stir into sugar mixture until batter is mixed. Fold walnuts and raisins into the batter; pour into the prepared loaf pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean, about 50 minutes.
