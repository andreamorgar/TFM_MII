Slice the fruit up into bite-size pieces and place in a punch bowl. (You may want to slightly crush the citrus fruits to get a little more of the flavor into the punch.) Pour in the bottle of red wine, and stir in carbonated soda (Pour it in slowly, and taste as you go along - you don't want to over-dilute the wine!)
