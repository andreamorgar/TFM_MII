Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, and salt together in a bowl. Beat cream, vanilla yogurt, and egg together in a separate bowl until smooth. Pour flour mixture into cream mixture and mix until a sticky dough forms; fold in peaches. Drop spoonfuls of the dough, working in batches, into the hot oil and fry until fritters are golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove fritters with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
