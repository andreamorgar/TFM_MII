Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8x4-inch loaf pan. Sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Set aside. In a medium bowl, mix together the sugar, egg, and oil. Stir in the flour mixture just until combined, and fold in the apples, nuts, and raisins. Bake for 55 to 60 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.
