Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Combine oats, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Add milk, butter, applesauce, egg, and vanilla extract; mix until a smooth, thin consistency is reached. Pour oatmeal into prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, 25 to 30 minutes.
