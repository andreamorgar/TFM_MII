Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets. In a bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Beat butter and sugar in a bowl until light and fluffy with an electric mixer set on medium speed. Add egg and vanilla extract to mixture and beat in. Mix in the flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with cream. Mixture should form a thick batter. One at a time, dip each date in the batter and place onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake one sheet at a time in the center of the preheated oven until the batter is lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
