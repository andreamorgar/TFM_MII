Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place raisins in a bowl and cover with boiling water; set aside for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain well and dry raisins in cloth, set aside. Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until lightly brown. Drain, crumble into small pieces and set aside. In a large bowl, combine sausage, white sugar and brown sugar; stir until mixture is well blended. Add eggs and beat well. In a separate bowl, sift together flour, ginger, baking powder and pumpkin pie spice. Stir baking soda into coffee. Add flour mixture and coffee alternately to meat mixture, beating well after each addition. Fold raisins and walnuts into cake batter. Turn batter into well-greased and floured Bundt cake pan. Bake in preheated oven for 75 to 90 minutes until done. Cool 15 minutes in pan before turning out onto serving platter.
