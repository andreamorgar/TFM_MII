Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a bowl, mix the veal, bread crumbs, egg, baby carrots, 1/2 cup ketchup, garlic, and onion. Season with salt, parsley, chili powder, and pepper. Transfer to an 8x8 inch pan, and form into a loaf shape. Top with remaining ketchup. Cover, and bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove cover, and continue baking 15 minutes, or to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Let sit 10 minutes before serving.
