In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and confectioners' sugar. Make a well in the center. Combine the melted butter, egg and milk; pour into the well. Use a knife to stir until just combined. Set the dumpling mixture aside. In a large saucepan, over medium-high heat, mix together the water, golden syrup, brown sugar and lemon juice until well blended. Add the remaining 1/4 cup of butter, and bring the mixture to a boil. Once the mixture is boiling, carefully drop heaping tablespoons of the dumpling mix into the sauce. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 10 minutes, or until the dumplings have risen and cooked through. Ladle syrup over the dumplings occasionally while cooking.
