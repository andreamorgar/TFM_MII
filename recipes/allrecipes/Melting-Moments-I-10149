Combine dry ingredients. Cream butter until fluffy. Add to flour mixture and beat thoroughly. Refrigerate 1 hour. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Shape dough into 1 inch balls. Place about 1 1/2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Flatten with lightly floured fork. Bake for about 20 minutes or until edges are just lightly browned. Don't overbake.
