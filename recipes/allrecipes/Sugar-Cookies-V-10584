Beat butter or margarine with white and brown sugars. Add both of the eggs and the vanilla (you don't HAVE to have vanilla, you can do without it). Add dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, salt) and beat until well mixed. Cover and put in refrigerator for an hour. After an hour, roll on a flat, floured surface and cut with cookie cutters (try many different shapes and sizes!) Bake at a medium heat (180 degrees C, 375 degrees F) for about 10 minutes (until you like their color). Good luck!
