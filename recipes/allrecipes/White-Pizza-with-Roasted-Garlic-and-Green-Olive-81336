Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slice the top off of the head of garlic, and sprinkle with a little salt. Place on a square of aluminum foil, and drizzle with olive oil. Wrap the foil loosely around the garlic. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until cloves are tender. Drizzle olive oil from the garlic foil pack over the pizza crust, and brush to spread evenly. Sprinkle the green olives over the crust. Top with shredded cheese. Squeeze the garlic cloves out of the paper skins, and distribute on top of the pizza. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the edges are nicely browned. Allow to cool for a few minutes, then slice and serve.
