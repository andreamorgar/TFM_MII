Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.) In a large bowl, pour warm melted butter over 3/4 cup chocolate chips. Stir until smooth. Mix together flour, brown sugar, and white sugar, then stir into chocolate mixture. Stir in eggs and vanilla. Fold in pecans, coconut, and 1/4 cup chocolate chips. Pour into pie crust. Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes. Top should be set, and may crack slightly, but the pie is best if under-baked.
