Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine chicken, bread crumbs, garlic, oregano, salt, egg and mozzarella together in a bowl. Mix well and roll into 12 (1 1/2-inch) meatballs. Place meatballs in an oven-proof skillet. Bake until meatballs are cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Heat Ragu(R) Old World Style(R) Pasta Sauce until warmed through. Toast the rolls. To make a slider, spoon sauce on the bottom of a slider bun. Top with meatball and top of bun. Serve.
