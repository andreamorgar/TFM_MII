In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and confectioners' sugar. Add egg, orange extract, and orange zest; mix until smooth. Sift together the flour and baking powder; stir into the creamed mixture. Then, stir in the dried cherries and chopped pistachios. Roll dough into a 10 inch long log about 2 1/2 inches in diameter, wrap in plastic or wax paper, and freeze for 2 hours. If dough is too difficult to form a log, refrigerate for 1 hour first. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease two cookie sheets. Cut roll into 1/2 inch slices and place onto the cookie sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool on the cookie sheet 1 to 2 minutes before removing to cool on a wire rack. Use melted candy coating to drizzle a striped pattern on the cookies when they are completely cool.
