Heat brown sugar, cream, butter, and salt in a heavy saucepan over medium heat until butter melts, about 5 minutes; remove from heat. Mix confectioner's sugar, maple extract, and vanilla extract into the sugar mixture. Grease an 8-inch square cake pan. Pour sugar mixture into the prepared pan. Refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.
