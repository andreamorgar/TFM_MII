In a large mixing bowl, cream together butter and 2 cups of the sugar. Add eggs one at a time and beat well after each. Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder and 1 teaspoon of the cardamom. Add flour mixture to the creamed butter mixture alternately with the milk. In a small separate bowl, blend remaining sugar and cardamom. Dip rounded teaspoonfuls of dough into sugar/cardamom mixture. Place on greased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on wire racks.
