Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine grapes, olive oil, chopped thyme, and chopped oregano together in a bowl and lightly toss to coat. Place grapes on baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until grapes begin to wrinkle and split, about 15 minutes. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar and season with salt and ground black pepper.
