Make filling: Cook spinach in 1 inch simmering water in a small saucepan, stirring, until wilted, about 5 seconds. Drain in a sieve and rinse under cold water until cool. Squeeze to remove as much moisture as possible. Finely chop spinach and stir with remaining filling ingredients until blended. Fill wrappers and steam dumplings: Stack a few wonton wrappers (keep remaining wrappers covered) and cut into rounds with a 2 1/2-inch cutter. Spread 1 slightly rounded teaspoon filling onto each round, spreading up to but not over edge. Bring up edge of each round, pleating to form a cup and leaving open at top. Bring enough water to a boil in a wok so that bottom rim of steamer (not basket) rests in water. Line steamer rack with lettuce. Arrange dumplings over lettuce, making sure dumplings do not touch each other. Cover with steamer lid and steam until filling is cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Make dipping sauce: Stir together all sauce ingredients.
