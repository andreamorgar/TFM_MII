In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the sugar, milk powder, shortening, eggs, salt, extract, spices and 2 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl; turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a floured surface; divide in half. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes. For topping, combine the sugar, lemon peel and nutmeg; set aside. Shape each portion of dough into a 16-in. log. Cut each log into 12 pieces; shape each into a ball. Dip top in melted butter, then in topping mixture. Place topping side up in well-greased muffin cups. Set aside remaining melted butter and topping. Using greased scissors, cut rolls in half and then in quarters, almost to the bottom. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Brush with remaining melted butter; sprinkle with remaining topping. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks. Serve warm.
