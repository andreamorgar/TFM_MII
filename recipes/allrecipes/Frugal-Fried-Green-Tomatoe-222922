Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place cornmeal in a bowl; dip and coat each tomato slice until thoroughly coated. Place coated tomato slices side by side in the hot oil; fry until coating is browned and crusty, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Season with salt and black pepper. Repeat with remaining tomato slices.
