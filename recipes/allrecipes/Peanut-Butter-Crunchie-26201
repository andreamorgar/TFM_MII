Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a large bowl, cream together the margarine, peanut butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; stir into the peanut butter mixture. Crush the cereal squares and stir into the dough until well blended. Roll tablespoons of dough into balls and place them 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Flatten slightly using a fork and making a criss cross pattern. Dip the fork in sugar to prevent sticking. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the bottoms are lightly browned. Let stand on the cookie sheet for 1 minute before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
