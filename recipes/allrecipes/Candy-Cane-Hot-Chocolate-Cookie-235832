Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; beat in eggs, 1 at a time, until incorporated. Stir vanilla extract and almond extract into butter mixture. Whisk flour, hot chocolate mix, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl; stir into butter mixture until dough is smooth. Fold white chocolate into dough. Drop rounded teaspoonfuls of dough, about 2-inches apart, onto baking sheets. Generously sprinkle crushed candy canes over cookie dough. Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are slightly crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Immediately arrange marshmallows onto hot cookies; cool on baking sheets until set. Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool completely.
