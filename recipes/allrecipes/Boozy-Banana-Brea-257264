Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a loaf pan with cooking spray. Whisk flour, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Mix bananas, brown sugar, butter, eggs, almond extract, and amaretto together in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture; mix just until flour is incorporated, about 1 minute. Transfer mixture to the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool before serving, about 30 minutes.
