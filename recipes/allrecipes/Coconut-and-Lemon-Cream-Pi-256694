Combine flour, coconut oil, 2 tablespoons sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; mix until mixture forms large crumbles. Pour in ice water in a steady stream and continue to mix until dough comes together, about 30 seconds. Transfer dough to a large sheet of plastic wrap. Form into a disc and wrap tightly. Chill for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Press 3/4 of the dough into the bottom of a broiler-safe pie plate. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Let crust cool completely. Combine 2 cups sugar, coconut cream, eggs, egg yolks, lemon zest and juice, butter, and salt in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until curd thickens and coats the back of a wooden spoon, 10 to 12 minutes. Pour into a bowl and refrigerate until set, 20 to 30 minutes. Beat egg whites, 1/2 cup sugar, salt, and cream of tartar in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until stiff, glossy peaks form, 6 to 7 minutes. Pour chilled curd into the cooled crust. Dollop big spoonfuls of meringue all over the curd. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Broil in the preheated oven until meringue is lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Chill pie until set, 3 to 24 hours.
