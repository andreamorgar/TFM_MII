Place a few ice cubes in a pitcher; add pineapple juice, coconut milk, lime juice, and almond-flavored syrup and stir until chilled. Strain mixture and pour into 4 glasses. Top each glass with club soda; mocktail will foam up. Dust each mocktail with nutmeg. Garnish with a lime wheel, sprig of mint, and umbrella.
