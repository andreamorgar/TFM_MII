In a medium saucepan combine the brown sugar, hot water, bacon grease, and raisins, over medium heat. Bring to a boil for 5 minutes, then set aside to cool. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8x4 inch loaf pans. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, and cloves. Add the ingredients from the saucepan and mix until well blended. Divide evenly between the two prepared pans. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool in pans for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
