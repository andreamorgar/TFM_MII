Combine rum, raisins, and brown sugar in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until raisins absorb rum, about 10 minutes. Toast semolina in a dry saucepan over medium heat, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add water, coconut cream, sugar, oil, eggs, and salt; cook and stir until mixture thickens, 8 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat and stir in raisin mixture. Cook and stir until mixture pulls away from the sides of the pan, 5 minutes to 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch baking dish. Scrape semolina mixture into the prepared baking dish; smooth the top. Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 1 hour. Garnish with a drizzle of honey and poppy seeds.
