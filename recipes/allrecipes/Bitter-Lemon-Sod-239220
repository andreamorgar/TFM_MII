Combine sugar, water, lemon zest, and lavender in a pot and cover; bring to a boil. Cook mixture until sugar is dissolved, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove pot from heat and cool syrup to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Pour lemon juice into a pitcher, strain syrup into lemon juice, and stir until concentrate is evenly mixed. Refrigerate concentrate until chilled, at least 1 hour. Fill serving glasses with ice and pour about 2 ounces concentrate into each glass; top with tonic water and stir.
