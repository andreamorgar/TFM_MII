Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together flour, softened butter, and 3/4 cup chopped nuts until a soft dough forms. Press dough into bottom and sides of a 9 inch deep-dish pie pan. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Allow to cool completely. In a medium mixing bowl, beat together softened cream cheese and confectioners' sugar until fluffy. Fold in 1 1/2 cups nondairy whipped topping. Spread mixture into cooled crust. In a medium bowl, whisk together pudding mix and cold milk until smooth. Allow to set up 5 minutes, then spread over cream cheese layer. Top with remaining whipped topping and sprinkle with remaining nuts. Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.
