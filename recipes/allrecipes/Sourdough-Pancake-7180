In a large bowl, combine the sourdough starter, egg, water, and oil. In a separate bowl, combine the nonfat dry milk, salt, baking soda, and sugar. Stir to blend dry ingredients. Add to sourdough starter and mix until batter is smooth. Bake on a greased 350 degree F(175 degree C) griddle until golden brown on the bottom. Flip and bake on opposite side.
