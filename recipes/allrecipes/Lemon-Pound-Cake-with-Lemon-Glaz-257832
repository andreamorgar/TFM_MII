Add eggs, one at a time, blending after each addition. Beat in vanilla and lemon zest. Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Stir flour mixture into butter mixture, alternating with milk. Scrape batter into prepared pan. Bake for 50 to 55 minutes or until tester inserted into center comes out clean. Let stand 5 minutes.
