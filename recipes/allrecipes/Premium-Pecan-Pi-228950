Par-bake your favorite pie crust (either homemade or store-bought) in a 350-degree oven for about 20 minutes or until it just barely starts to brown. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a bowl of a stand mixer, fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the eggs on medium speed for about 30 seconds, until foamy. Add the Karo syrups, maple syrup, salt and vanilla, and beat for about one minute on medium speed until well combined. Add the flour and melted butter Place the pecans in the par-baked pie crust and pour the mixture over the pecans. Bake the pie for 40 minutes. TIP: To determine when the pie is ready, gently move the pie. If the center is firm and does not wiggle, then it is ready.
