Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, salt and confectioners' sugar. Stir in the butter and vanilla, and mix until a stiff dough forms. Pat dough into 9-inch round cake pan, and prick well with a fork. Sprinkle remaining sugar over dough. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden. Cut into wedges while warm. Cool on wire rack; separate cookies.
