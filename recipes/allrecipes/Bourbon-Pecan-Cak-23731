Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Combine 1 cup of the flour with currants and pecans. Set aside. Mix together the remaining 2 cups flour, baking powder, salt and nutmeg. Set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg yolks one at a time, then beat in the flour mixture alternately with the bourbon. Stir in the currant pecan mixture. In a large bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff. Gently fold egg whites into the cake batter. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
