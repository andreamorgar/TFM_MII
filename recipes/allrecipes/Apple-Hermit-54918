Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and salt. In a large mixing bowl, cream butter until light and fluffy. Mix in sugar and egg. Stir in flour mixture, and mix thoroughly. Fold in nuts, apples, and raisins. Drop by rounded teaspoon onto prepared cookie sheets about 1 1/2 inches apart. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes. Cool on wire rack. In a small bowl, mix confectioners' sugar with milk to make a thin glaze. Drizzle over cooled cookies.
