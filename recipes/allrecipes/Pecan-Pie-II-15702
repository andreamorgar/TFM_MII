Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prick pastry shell in several places with a fork and bake in preheated oven for 5 minutes. Remove and allow to cool. In a large bowl, combine sugar, corn syrup, eggs, vanilla, salt, and pecans. Mix well, then pour into pie shell. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes. Check after 30 minutes; if crust is getting too brown, cover edges with aluminum foil. When done, pie will be a little loose in center, but will set as it cools; do not overbake.
