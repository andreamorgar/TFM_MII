Steep the tea bags in the boiling water for 10 minutes. Discard the tea bags and allow the tea to cool to room temperature. To prepare the drinks, fill 4 glasses with ice cubes and pour 1 cup of lemonade into each glass. Carefully pour 1 cup of cooled tea into each glass so that it floats on the lemonade.
