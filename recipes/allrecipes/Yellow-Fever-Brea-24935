In a small bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. In a separate bowl, sift together 4 1/2 cups flour, salt, curry powder and turmeric. Make a well in the center of flour mixture. Pour in yeast mixture and 1/2 cup clarified butter. Stir in the remaining 4 cups flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until a stiff dough is formed. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Grease a bowl with remaining clarified butter, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with butter. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 4 hours. After 4 hours punch dough down, flip over and let rise for 2 more hours. Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form into loaves. Place the loaves into two lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pans. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake dough in preheated oven for 45 to 60 minutes, until loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped.
