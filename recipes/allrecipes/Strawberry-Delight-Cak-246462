Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix strawberry cake mix, water, eggs, and oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer on low speed. Increase speed to medium and mix batter for 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean, 24 to 27 minutes. Poke holes all over the cake using the handle of a wooden spoon. Pour sweetened condensed milk over cake, letting it seep into the holes. Cool cake to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Pour thawed strawberries over cake, letting juices seep into the holes. Cover cake with whipped topping. Refrigerate.
