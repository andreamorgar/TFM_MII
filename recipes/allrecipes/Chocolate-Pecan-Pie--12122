Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C.) In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Stir in sugar, and set aside to cool. In a mixing bowl, beat eggs well. Stir in salt, corn syrup and melted butter mixture. Add coffee powder mixed with 1 teaspoon water, if desired. Stir in the chopped pecans. Spread chocolate chips evenly over the bottom of the pie crust. Pour pecan mixture over the crust. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes, or until set. Cover and let stand at room temperature about 8 hours before serving. Pie will be soft. Combine cream, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla in a small mixing bowl. Whip until stiff. Garnish pie.
