Beat eggs, milk, salt, garlic salt, onion salt, black pepper, and cumin together in a bowl; pour over the layers in the baking dish. Cover baking dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight. Remove dish from refrigerator and let warm at room temperature for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake the casserole bake in the preheated oven for 50 minutes.

Let casserole cool 10 minutes before cutting.
