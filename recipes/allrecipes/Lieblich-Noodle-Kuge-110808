Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the noodles, and cook until tender, about 6 minutes. Drain. Combine the cottage cheese, pineapple, and apples; set aside. Mix together the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl, and set aside. Spread one-third of the noodles onto the bottom of the prepared pan. Spread with half of the cottage cheese mixture, and sprinkle with one-third of the cinnamon sugar. Layer with another third of the noodles, and the remaining cottage cheese. Sprinkle with another third of the cinnamon sugar and the remaining noodles. Mix together the white wine and melted butter; brush onto the noodles. Sprinkle with remaining cinnamon sugar. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until apples are tender.
