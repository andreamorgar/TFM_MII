Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 24 mini-muffin cups. Beat cream cheese and butter until well combined. Add flour; mix until a dough forms. Divide dough into 24 balls and refrigerate. Whisk eggs and milk together in a bowl. Stir Monterey Jack cheese, chorizo sausage, green chiles, red onion, cilantro, garlic powder, black pepper, ground cumin, cayenne pepper, and salt into the egg mixture. Place one dough ball into each prepared muffin cup; press dough gently into the base and sides to form a dough cup. Spoon egg mixture to fill each dough cup. Bake in preheated oven until center of quiche is set, 25 minutes.
