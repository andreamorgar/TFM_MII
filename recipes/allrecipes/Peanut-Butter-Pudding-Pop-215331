In a saucepan over medium heat, heat milk until bubbles form at edges. In a bowl, combine sugar, cornstarch and salt. Add 1/4 cup of the hot milk to the cornstarch mixture, then whisk well until all the liquid is incorporated and there are no lumps. Pour the cornstarch mixture into the milk, whisking to combine. Continue to cook and stir until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a metal spoon, about 8 to 10 minutes. Do not boil. Remove from heat, stir in vanilla extract and peanut butter. Pour the pudding into the pop molds to within 1/4 of the top, leaving room for the pudding to expand. Place the tops on the mold and freeze until frozen solid, about 4 hours. To remove from molds, run under hot water to slightly melt the side of the pudding pop, then twist the stem top and remove.
