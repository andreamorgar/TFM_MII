Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C.) In a large bowl, combine eggs, flour, sugar, almond extract and melted butter. Pour into unbaked pie crust. Arrange sliced pears in spokes radiating from center. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, then reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake for 25 to 35 minutes, or until custard is firm. Cool completely before serving.
