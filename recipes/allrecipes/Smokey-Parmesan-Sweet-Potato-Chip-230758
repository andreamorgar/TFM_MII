Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Peel sweet potato with a vegetable peeler and discard skin. Continue using peeler to create thin strips of sweet potato; transfer to a large bowl. Drizzle strips with olive oil; toss to coat. Mix Parmesan cheese, kosher salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder into sweet potato strips; toss to coat evenly. Spread coated sweet potato strips evenly onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until sweet potato chips are crispy, 20 to 25 minutes.
