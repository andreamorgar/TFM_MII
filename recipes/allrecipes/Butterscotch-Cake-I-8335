Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt pan. In a large bowl, combine cake mix, pudding mix, milk, oil and egg whites. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then on medium speed for 2 minutes. Pour batter into Bundt pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 to 60 minutes, or until toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out clean. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack, and continue to cool completely. Sprinkle with confectioners sugar before serving.
