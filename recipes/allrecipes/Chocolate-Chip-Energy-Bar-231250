Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan. Mix oats, walnuts, olive oil, chocolate chips, honey, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Press oat mixture firmly into the prepared baking pan. Place pan in a cold oven. Heat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake energy bars until heated through, 25 minutes. Cool completely before cutting into squares.
