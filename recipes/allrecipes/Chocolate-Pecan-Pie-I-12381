Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Over hot, not boiling, water melt 1 cup chocolate chips. Remove from heat, and let cool. In a small bowl, beat the eggs and salt; beat with an electric mixer at high speed until very thick and lemon colored, about 5 minutes. Gradually beat in the brown sugar and melted chocolate. Stir in chopped pecans and remaining 1 cup chocolate morsels. Pour filling into the unbaked pie crust. Decorate top with pecan halves. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes.
