Heat oil in a deep-fryer or heavy deep skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl, whisk together eggs and milk. Place seasoned bread crumbs in a separate bowl. Dip artichoke hearts in the egg mixture, then roll in bread crumbs until they are fully covered. Deep-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, until deep golden brown. Remove to paper towels to drain excess oil. When all the pieces have been fried, place on a serving tray and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
