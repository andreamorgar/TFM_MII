Melt the butter in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and smoked sausage in the butter until hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the corn and reduce heat to medium; cover and cook until the corn is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder, monosodium glutamate, and pepper; toss to combine. Serve hot.
