Mix confectioners' sugar, powdered milk, processed cheese food, butter, cocoa powder, walnuts, and vanilla extract in a large bowl with a stand mixer using the dough hook attachment until mixture is blended. The mixture will seem dry at first; continue mixing until smooth. Press cheese mixture into a large baking sheet. Refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.
