Whisk milk, sugar, and salt together in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer. Stir peach puree, ginger, cinnamon, and vanilla extract; simmer until flavors blend, 5 to 10 minutes. Place egg yolks in a small bowl. Slowly pour 1/2 cup hot milk mixture into eggs, whisking constantly. Pour warmed egg mixture into the milk mixture in the saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Strain egg mixture into a chilled bowl and refrigerate, stirring occasionally, until chilled, about 2 hours. Whisk cream into chilled egg mixture; add peaches and stir. Pour peach mixture into the container of an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions.
