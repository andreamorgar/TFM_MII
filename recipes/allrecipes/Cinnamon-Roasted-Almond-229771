Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Beat egg whites and vanilla extract in a large bowl; add almonds and toss to coat. Stir brown sugar, white sugar, cinnamon, and salt into almonds until blended. Spread almond mixture into prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven, stirring every 15 minutes, until coating is dry, about 75 minutes.
