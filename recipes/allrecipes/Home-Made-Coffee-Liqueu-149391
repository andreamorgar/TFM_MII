Stir the water, sugar, and instant coffee together in a saucepan over high heat until the sugar dissolves and the mixture boils. Remove from the heat, and cool 30 to 45 minutes. Stir in the rum and vanilla. Using a funnel, pour into 3 clean wine bottles. Seal, and store in a dark, cool place at least 2 weeks before drinking.
