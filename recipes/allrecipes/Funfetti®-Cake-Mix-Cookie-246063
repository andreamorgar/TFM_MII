Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets. Mix cake mix, canola oil, and eggs together in a bowl until smooth. Roll dough into walnut-size balls; flatten to 1/4-inch thick on baking sheets, 2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, 6 to 8 minutes.
