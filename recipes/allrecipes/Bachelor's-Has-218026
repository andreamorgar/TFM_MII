Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook and stir the ground beef until the meat is crumbly and evenly browned. Drain and discard any excess grease. Transfer the beef to an 8x8-inch baking dish. Layer about 1/4 of the onion on top of the beef, then spread the grated potatoes over the onion. Season with salt and pepper. Spread another 1/4 of the onion over, then layer the carrots on top. Season with salt and pepper again. Add another layer of onion, then cover with the corn. Season with salt and pepper, then top with the remaining onion. Spread the green beans over the onion, then arrange the bacon slices on top. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes, then remove the foil and continue baking until the bacon is crisp and the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes more.
