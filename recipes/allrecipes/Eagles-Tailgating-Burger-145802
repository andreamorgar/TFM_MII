Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Combine the ground beef, bread crumbs, Romano cheese, barbeque sauce, beer, egg, green onion, basil, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Mix lightly using your hands, then form into 8 patties. Lightly brush the grill grate with oil and place patties on the grill. Cook until no longer pink in the center, 7 to 8 minutes per side for well done.
