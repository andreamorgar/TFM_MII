Whisk together vinegar, shallot, sugar, mustard, salt, and pepper, then add 1/2 cup oil in a stream, whisking until emulsified. Put turkey in a large shallow baking dish and pour 1/4 cup vinaigrette over it, turning to coat. Marinate at room temperature, turning occasionally, 10 minutes. Remove from marinade and pat dry (discard used marinade). Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until just smoking, then saute half of cutlets (without crowding), turning over once, until browned and just cooked through, about 4 minutes total. Transfer as cooked to a cutting board and keep warm, loosely covered with foil. Cook remaining cutlets in remaining tablespoon oil in same manner. Slice cutlets along the grain into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Toss greens with some of remaining vinaigrette and any juices accumulated on cutting board until well coated. Divide greens among 4 plates and top with turkey strips and cheese shavings.
