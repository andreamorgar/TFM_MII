Cook noodles al dente. Drain and rinse. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl, mix together cottage cheese, sour cream, parmesan, 1 egg, 1 cup cheddar cheese, Worcestershire sauce, milk, butter or margarine, and salt and pepper. Stir in cooked noodles. Spread into a 9 inch square baking dish, top with remaining shredded cheese. Bake at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for one hour, or until set.
