Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Roll the dough into an 10-inch square on a well-floured surface. Arrange half of the pepperoni over top, and sprinkle evenly with half of the mozzarella cheese. Arrange the remaining pepperoni over the cheese, and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Fold the left third of the dough over the middle third, then fold the right third on top of that. Fold the top and bottom ends over the bread so the edges meet in the center. Drizzle the bread with olive oil, and place seam-side-down onto a nonstick baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the bread is golden brown and crusty, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool before slicing.
