Pour the water into a large pot. Add the apricots and grapes. Cover and let soak in the refrigerator overnight. The next day, bring the contents of the pot to a boil. As soon as it boils, remove it from the heat. Cool completely. The fruit should be soft and the grapes should look swollen. Cool, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Serve after the drink is completely chilled.
