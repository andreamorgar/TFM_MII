Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla and lemon extract. Beat in water and sour cream. Beat in the cake mix and flour. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 60 to 80 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
