Line a 5- to 6-quart slow cooker with a Reynolds(R) Slow Cooker Liner. Coat the beef with flour. Cook and stir beef in a large skillet in hot oil over medium-high heat about 5 minutes or until browned. Place the beans, carrots, onion, and garlic into the prepared slow cooker liner. Top with the beef. Add tomatoes, broth, chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper. Cover and cook on low 7 hours or until the beef is fork-tender. Stir in the corn gently with a rubber spatula. Cover and cook 10 minutes more or until heated through. If desired, serve with avocado, cilantro, and/or crushed red pepper.
