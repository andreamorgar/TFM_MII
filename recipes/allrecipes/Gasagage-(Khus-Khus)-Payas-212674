Combine the almonds, poppy seeds, and rice in a bowl; pour enough water over the mixture to cover by about 1 inch. Allow to soak for 4 hours; drain. Grind the almond mixture with the coconut into a paste using a mortar and pestle. Stir the water and jaggery together in a saucepan until the jaggery dissolves into the water to make a syrup. Stir the paste into the syrup; add the saffron and cardamom to the mixture. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring continually; boil and stir until thick. Serve hot, warm, or cold, depending on your preference.
