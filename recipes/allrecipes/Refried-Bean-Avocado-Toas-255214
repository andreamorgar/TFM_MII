Toast whole wheat bread until golden brown. Spread refried beans on top. Mash avocado in a small bowl; stir in lime juice, garlic powder, salt, chili powder, and cumin. Spread avocado over refried beans. Heat a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Crack egg into the skillet; cook until white is set, about 2 minutes. Cover skillet and cook until yolk is set, about 2 minutes more. Place egg over mashed avocado. Garnish with pico de gallo, queso fresco, and hot sauce.
