Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large mixing bowl cream together the butter, sugar, and flour until smooth and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until fully incorporated. Stir in the lemon juice. Pour the mixture into the pie shell. Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until filling is set and browned. Cool on wire rack.
