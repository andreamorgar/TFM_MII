Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat eggs, milk, sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a bowl; dip toast into egg mixture and press into crushed corn flakes until coated. Arrange coated toast in a single layer in a baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and crispy, 6 to 8 minutes per side.
