Make a tumbler out of the coconut by carefully slicing about 2 inches off the top of the coconut, keeping the coconut milk inside. Place the ice, tequila, melon liqueur, rum, pineapple juice, and sugar syrup into the cavity of the coconut. Squeeze the lime half over the mixture and drop the lime into the drink; stir.
