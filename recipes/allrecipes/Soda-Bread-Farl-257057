Sift flour and salt together into a bowl and make a well in the middle. Pour in enough buttermilk to make a soft, but not sticky dough; mix well. Transfer dough to a well floured work surface and knead. Shape dough into a round about 1/2-inch thick. Cut dough into 4 or 8 farls (flatbread) using a bread knife. Lightly flour a griddle over medium heat; place farls on the griddle. Cook until lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side.
