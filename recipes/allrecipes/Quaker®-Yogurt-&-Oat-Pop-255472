In food processor, puree raspberries, 1/3 cup (75 mL) water, 2 tbsp (30 mL) honey, and lemon juice. Set aside. Reserve 1 tbsp (15 mL) oats; mix together remaining oats and honey, and yogurt. Spoon 2 tsp (10 mL) raspberry puree into each of 10 ice pop moulds. Divide yogurt mixture evenly among moulds; top evenly with remaining raspberry puree. Swirl together using butter knife or spoon. Sprinkle remaining oats evenly over top of each mould. Insert ice pop sticks into moulds; freeze for about 6 hours or until set.
