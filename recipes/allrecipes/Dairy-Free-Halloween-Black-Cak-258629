Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix flour, sugar, chocolate chips, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt together in a 9-inch cake pan. Add cold brew, pumpkin puree, oil, and vanilla extract and mix thoroughly. Stir vinegar in until just combined. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 30 minutes.
