Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). In a large roasting pan, melt margarine. Mix in seasoning salt, Worcestershire sauce, celery salt, and garlic salt. Stir crispy rice, corn, wheat and oat cereals, pretzels and nuts into the butter mixture and coat well. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
