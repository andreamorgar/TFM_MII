Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk together the flour, white sugar, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Beat honey, milk, butter, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl until smooth. Stir the flour mixture into the honey mixture until just combined. Fold in the chocolate and vanilla chips. Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto nonstick baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Allow cookies to cool; dust with confectioners' sugar.
