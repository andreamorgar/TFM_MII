Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt pan. Sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger. Set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the shortening, eggs, brown sugar and white sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the pumpkin puree. Beat in the flour mixture. Stir in the chopped pecans. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 60 to 65 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
