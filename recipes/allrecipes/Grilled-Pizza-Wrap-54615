Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat. Spread margarine over one side of a tortilla, and place it margarine-side down in the skillet. Spoon a tablespoon of pizza sauce onto half of the tortilla. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of shredded cheese over the sauce, and top with a few slices of pepperoni. Fold the clean half of the tortilla over the filling, and cook until golden on each side. Repeat with remaining tortillas.
