In a 1 quart saucepan, stir together sugar, cornstarch and salt. Place over medium-low heat and stir in eggs and milk. Cook, stirring, until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a metal spoon. Stir in vanilla and butter. Let cool briefly and serve warm, or chill in refrigerator until serving.
