Grease two 9-inch pie plates. Pulse flour, baking powder, 1/2 cup sugar, and salt in a food processor several times until combined. Place butter into the flour mixture and pulse just until butter resembles coarse crumbs. Mix in 1 egg and vanilla extract; process until dough holds together, about 30 seconds. Place dough on a well-floured work surface, divide in half, and roll each piece into a 9-inch round crust. Fit crusts into the prepared pie plates and freeze for 1 hour. Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; stir in rice and return to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until rice has absorbed the water, about 20 minutes. Stir milk into the rice and bring to a simmer; cook until thickened, stirring often, about 10 more minutes. Set rice mixture aside to cool. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Beat ricotta cheese, 1 cup sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and 6 eggs together in a bowl until smooth. Stir in cooked rice mixture and crushed pineapple until thoroughly combined. Divide the filling between the 2 cold pie crusts. Bake in the preheated oven until the filling is set and the tops are golden brown, about 90 minutes. Cool on racks.
