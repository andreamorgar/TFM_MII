Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease baking sheets. Beat shortening and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat 1 egg into the shortening mixture until completely blended. Add the second egg and vanilla to shortening mixture; beat to combine. Stir flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg together in a bowl; beat into the shortening mixture in small amounts, alternately with the sour cream. Blend water into the dough. Drop dough by tablespoonful onto prepared baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, 6 to 7 minutes. Cool cookies on the baking sheets for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
