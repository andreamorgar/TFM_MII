Grind the basmati rice in a coffee grinder until it resembles a coarse powder. Empty the ground rice into a bowl. Repeat the process with the quinoa, millet, buckwheat, sesame seeds, and flax seeds. Stir in the cornmeal and amaranth. Store in an air tight container in the refrigerator until ready to cook.
