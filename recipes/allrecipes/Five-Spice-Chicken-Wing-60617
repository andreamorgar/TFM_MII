Whisk together the garlic, green onion, sugar, five-spice powder, fish sauce, soy sauce, chili sauce, and salt in a bowl. Arrange the chicken pieces in a shallow, non-metallic dish. Spoon the sauce mixture over the chicken to evenly coat. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. Arrange the marinated chicken on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until crispy, about 45 minutes. Serve with lime wedges on the side.
