Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Steam carrots until soft but not mushy. Cool slightly. Place carrots in food processor and puree until smooth. Add honey, eggs, butter or margarine, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, and walnuts. Blend until smooth. Pour mixture into a large bowl. In a separate bowl combine brown sugar and white sugar, mixing well to get all lumps out. Fold sugar mixture gradually into carrot mixture until well incorporated. Pour mixture into partially baked pie shell. Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 70 minutes, until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Serve pie warm or cold. Refrigerate any leftovers.
