In a 2-quart container, stir honey and triple sec together until honey has dissolved. Mix in the orange juice, lemon juice, and lime juice, brandy, Cabernet Sauvignon wine, and sparkling water. Stir in the orange, lemon, and lime slices; adjust sweetness with more honey, if necessary, and serve in tall glasses over ice.
