Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring pork, onion, and chicken broth to a simmer in a large pot; cook, stirring occasionally to break up large pieces of pork, until pork is no longer pink at the center, about 30 minutes. Remove pot from heat; stir in stuffing mix until evenly moistened. Pour mixture into a baking dish with a lid. Bake in the preheated oven until stuffing is heated through and flavors are blended, about 45 minutes.
