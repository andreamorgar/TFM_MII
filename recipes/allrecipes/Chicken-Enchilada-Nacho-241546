Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute onion, jalapeno pepper, chile pepper, and garlic until fragrant and lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add chicken broth, chicken, chili powder, seasoned salt, cumin, and cayenne pepper; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center about 5 minutes. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave, 15 to 20 seconds. Stir flour into melted butter until smooth. Mix flour-butter mixture and sour cream into chicken mixture; cook and stir until sauce is thickened, 2 to 4 minutes. Add pepperjack cheese to sauce and stir until melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Spread chips onto a serving platter; top with sauce and pico de gallo.
