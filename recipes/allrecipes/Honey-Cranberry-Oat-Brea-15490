Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 8x4 inch loaf pans. In a medium bowl, stir together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and oats. In a large bowl, mix together honey, vegetable oil, eggs, and milk. Mix in flour mixture until just moistened. Stir in cranberries and walnuts. Divide batter into prepared pans equally. Cook for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the center of the loaves comes out clean.
