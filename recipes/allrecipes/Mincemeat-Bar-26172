Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease two 9x13 inch baking pans. In a large bowl, mix together the butter, brown sugar, molasses and 1 teaspoon vanilla until well blended. Combine the flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon and cloves; stir into the molasses mixture. Stir in hot water, almonds, raisins and mincemeat. Spread the dough evenly into the bottoms of both pans. It will be thin but the mixture will puff up when baking. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm. Cool in pans on wire racks. In a small bowl, mix together the confectioners' sugar, hot milk, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon almond extracts until smooth. Spread over warm bars. Allow to cool before cutting into squares.
