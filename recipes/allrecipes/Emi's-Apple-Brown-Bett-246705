Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread apple pie filling in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan. Sprinkle sugar and cinnamon on top. Mix flour, brown sugar, margarine, and baking powder in a large bowl to make a soft dough. Spoon dough over apple filling. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden, about 1 hour. Let cool for 15 minutes before cutting.
