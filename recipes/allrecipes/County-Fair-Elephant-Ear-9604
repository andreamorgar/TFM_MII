Mix flour, sugar and salt. Cut in butter, as for pastry. Soften yeast in water. Combine milk, egg yolk and softened yeast. Add to flour mixture and mix well. Cover dough and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Place dough on a lightly floured cutting board and knead lightly. Cover with a cloth and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Roll dough into a rectangle, 10x18 inches, and brush with soft butter. Mix 1/2 cup sugar and 2 teaspoons cinnamon and sprinkle evenly over dough. Roll as for jelly roll, sealing the edge. The roll should be 18 inches long. Cut dough into 1-inch slices. Mix remaining sugar and cinnamon on a large square of waxed paper or aluminum foil. Place slices, one at a time, on sugar mixture and roll into 5-inch balls. Sprinkle nuts on top and press gently. Place dough on ungreased cookie sheets, brush with melted butter and sprinkle with about 1 teaspoon of the sugar-cinnamon mixture. Bake immediately in a preheated 400 degree oven about 12 minutes. Cool on wire racks.
