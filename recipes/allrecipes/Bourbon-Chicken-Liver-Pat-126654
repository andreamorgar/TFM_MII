Melt 1 stick butter in a large nonstick skillet over moderately low heat, then cook onion and garlic, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add herbs, salt, pepper, allspice, and livers and cook, stirring, until livers are cooked outside but still pink when cut open, about 8 minutes. Stir in bourbon and remove from heat. Puree mixture in a food processor until smooth, then transfer pate to crock and smooth top. Melt remaining 1/2 stick butter in a very small heavy saucepan over low heat, then remove pan from heat and let butter stand 3 minutes. If using herb garnish, put sprig on top of pate. Skim froth from butter, then spoon enough clarified butter over pate to cover its surface, leaving milky solids in bottom of pan. Chill pate until butter is firm, about 30 minutes, then cover with plastic wrap and chill at least 2 hours more.
