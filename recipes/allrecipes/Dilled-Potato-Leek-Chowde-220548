Heat butter and olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Cook and stir leeks in hot butter and oil until softened, but not browned, about 5 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high and add chicken broth, potatoes, dill, and bay leaf. Cover and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Whisk half-and-half with flour in a small bowl until smooth; set aside. Mash about half of the potatoes against the side of the pot using a fork for a creamy, chunky soup. Stir flour mixture into the soup. Continue simmering until thickened, about 5 minutes.
