Heat refried beans in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave on high until warmed through, about 2 minutes, stirring after 1 minute. Spray both sides of each corn tortilla with cooking spray and arrange them on a wire rack. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Pan-fry one side of each tortilla until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Return tortillas to wire rack, browned sides up. Spread a thin layer of refried beans onto the tortillas, stopping about 1/2 inch from the edge. Sprinkle Mexican cheese blend over refried beans. Carefully transfer a tortilla pizza back to the skillet, bean side up. Lightly fry until cheese begins to melt, about 1 minute more; return tortilla pizza to wire rack. Repeat with remaining pizzas. Scatter tomatoes, green onions, cilantro, and olives over melted cheese. Slice pizzas to serve.
