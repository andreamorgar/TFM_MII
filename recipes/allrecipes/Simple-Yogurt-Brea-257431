Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan with cooking spray. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl. Mix yogurt, sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Stir in flour mixture a little at a time, mixing well between each addition to avoid lumps. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
