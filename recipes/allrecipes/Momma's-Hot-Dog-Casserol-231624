Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onions until translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer onions to a large bowl and mix cooked rotini, tomato soup, hot dogs, corn with its juice, dill pickle relish, and yellow mustard into onions. Pour mixture into a baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and the top is lightly browned, about 1 hour.
