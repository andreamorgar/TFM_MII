Whisk together the lime juice, tequila, orange juice, cilantro, chiles, chili powder, garlic, honey, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; pour into a gallon-sized resealable bag; add the pork tenderloins; seal and store in refrigerator overnight. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Cook the pork on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until meat has reached an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 20 minutes.
