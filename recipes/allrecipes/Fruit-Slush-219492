In a large bowl, stir the orange juice concentrate and sugar together until the sugar has dissolved; gently stir in the pineapple, strawberries, and bananas until coated, then stir in the ginger ale. Ladle about 2/3 cup of the mixture into a plastic cup, and freeze; repeat with remaining fruit salad and cups. Remove from freezer about 1 hour before serving.
