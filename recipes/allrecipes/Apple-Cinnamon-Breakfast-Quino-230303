Bring quinoa, water, and apple juice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low and add cinnamon. Cover and simmer quinoa for 10 minutes. Stir apples into the quinoa; continue simmering until the liquid is absorbed and quinoa is tender about 10 more minutes. Drizzle with agave nectar to serve.
