Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Unroll crescent dough, leaving it in one piece. Line a 8x8 inch baking dish with the dough; it should extend 1 inch up the sides. Prick dough with fork. Bake crust in preheated oven until golden, about 10 minutes. Layer the chopped ham, roasted red peppers, spinach, and Cheddar cheese in the baked crust. Beat eggs, milk, black pepper, and hot pepper sauce in a large bowl. Pour egg mixture over layered ingredients. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Turn oven to Broil and cook until browned, about 3 additional minutes. Turn off oven; allow quiche to rest for 10 minutes in cooling oven.
