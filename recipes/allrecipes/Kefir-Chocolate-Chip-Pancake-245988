Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Add kefir and eggs; stir until batter is moist but still lumpy. Fold in chocolate chips. Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until golden on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
