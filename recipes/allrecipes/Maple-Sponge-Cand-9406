Butter a 9x9 inch pan and set aside. In a heavy 2 quart saucepan, combine the syrup, sugar and vinegar. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly until sugar dissolves. Continue cooking without stirring until a candy thermometer reads 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Remove from heat and quickly stir in the baking soda.
