Combine oats, yogurt, and buckwheat flour in a bowl; pour in enough water to cover. Refrigerate oats mixture, 8 to 24 hours. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish. Drain water from oats mixture and transfer oat mixture to a bowl. Add coconut, eggs, butter, maple syrup, cinnamon, baking powder, vanilla extract, and salt and mix well; fold in blueberries. Spread mixture into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes.
