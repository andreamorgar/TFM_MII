Pour the limeade concentrate into a pitcher, and fill the can with cold water. Pour into the pitcher; repeat twice more (3 cans of water). Fill the can with tequila, and pour into the pitcher; fill half the can with orange liqueur, and pour into the pitcher. Stir well, chill thoroughly, and serve over ice in salt-rimmed glasses with a lime wedge.
