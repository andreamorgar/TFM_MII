Mix together 2/3 cup white sugar and peanut butter. Sprinkle 2/3 of the mixture into baked pie shell. Combine 1/2 cup sugar, corn starch, salt, milk, and egg yolks in a medium saucepan. Cook and stir over medium low heat until thick. Pour filling over peanut butter mixture in pie shell. In a clean glass bowl, beat egg whites until very stiff. Spread meringue on top of pie. Sprinkle remaining peanut butter crumbs on top of the egg whites. Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the meringue is golden brown.
