Melt butter in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in microwave at 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval to prevent popping, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk lemon juice, salt, and dill into melted butter; cook in microwave an additional 10 seconds. Whisk egg yolks into butter mixture vigorously until smooth, about 30 seconds. Whisk boiling water in gradually until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute more.
