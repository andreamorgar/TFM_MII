In a 4-quart saucepan over medium heat, combine cranberry sauce and chili sauce. Break the cranberry sauce into smaller pieces with wooden spoon to speed up the melting process. Stir and heat until the cranberry sauce is melted. Add the cocktail wieners and cook until the wieners are heated. Use toothpicks for serving.
