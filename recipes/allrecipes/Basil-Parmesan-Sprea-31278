In a food processor, blend the spinach, basil and garlic. Gradually mix in the olive oil and Parmesan cheese. Process until smooth. Salt and pepper to taste. Blend cream cheese and feta cheese in a medium bowl. Line a separate medium bowl with plastic wrap. Spread 1/2 the cream cheese mixture in the bowl. Top with sun-dried tomato paste and the spinach mixture. Cover with remaining cream cheese mixture. Pat together, cover and chill in the refrigerator at least 1 hour before serving. Flip out of the plastic lined bowl onto a medium serving dish to serve.
