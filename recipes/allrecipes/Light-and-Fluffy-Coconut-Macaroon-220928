Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease two baking sheets. Whisk egg whites in a bowl until frothy; stir in almond extract. Combine coconut, sugar, flour, and salt in a large bowl. Lightly stir egg white mixture into coconut mixture to form a batter. Scoop batter by the tablespoon and drop onto prepared baking sheet. Bake cookies in the preheated oven until edges start to brown, about 20 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool.
