Place potatoes, garlic and celery into a large stockpot with water to cover. Cover and bring to a boil. Cook until potatoes are tender, about 25 minutes. Season with turmeric, lemon juice, chicken bouillon cube and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for another 10 minutes. Mash some of the potato chunks for a thicker consistency.
