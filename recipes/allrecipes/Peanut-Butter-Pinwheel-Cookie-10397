Cream butter or margarine and sugar; add eggs and vanilla. Add dry ingredients to butter mixture. Divide dough into 2 parts. Roll each part out, to approximate 1/8 inch thick, then spread with 1/2 of the peanut butter. Roll up dough and refrigerate several hours. Slice and bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 5 - 8 minutes, until slightly brown.
