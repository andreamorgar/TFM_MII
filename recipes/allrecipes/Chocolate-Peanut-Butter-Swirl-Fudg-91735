In heavy saucepan, over low heat, melt peanut butter chips with 1 cup EAGLE BRAND(R), butter and salt. In small saucepan, over low heat, melt chocolate chips with remaining EAGLE BRAND(R). Remove from heat; add vanilla extract. Stir until smooth. Spread peanut butter mixture evenly into waxed paper lined 8- or 9-inch square pan. Spoon chocolate mixture over peanut mixture.
