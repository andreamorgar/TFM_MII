Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Combine flour, sugar, vegetable oil, eggs, salt, baking soda, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a large bowl; mix well. Stir in the chopped apples until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
