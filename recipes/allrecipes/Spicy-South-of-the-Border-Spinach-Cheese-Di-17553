Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Saute onion in skillet over medium heat in oil until softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and chiles, let cook 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and stir in spinach, cheese, cream cheese, half and half, and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon mixture into shallow baking dish like a 9 inch quiche dish or pie plate. Bake in the preheated oven until the dip is bubbly and the top is light brown, about 35 minutes.
