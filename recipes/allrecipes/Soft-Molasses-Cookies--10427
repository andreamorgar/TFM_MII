Mix together shortening, sugar, molasses and egg until creamy. Mix in the flour mixture alternately with the cold water. Mix in the baking soda and most of the walnuts, reserving a few to sprinkle on tops of cookies. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls onto greased cookie sheet, spacing 2 inches apart. Bake these for 12 minutes or until done.
