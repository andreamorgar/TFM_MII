Round off the ends of each cheese stick with a paring knife to resemble a fingertip. Roughly tear each cheese stick in half to form two torn-off "fingers". Shave off a piece of each cheese "fingertip" to form a nail bed; place an almond slice on the "nail bed" to form a "fingernail". Cut a few shallow lines in center of each "finger" to form knuckle marks. Pour several drops of hot sauce into small pools of "blood" on a serving plate. Dip torn ends of the cheese fingers into "blood" to resemble bloody fingers. Lay each "finger" in its own pool of "blood".
