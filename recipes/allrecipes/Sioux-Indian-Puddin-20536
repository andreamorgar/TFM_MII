Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Butter a 1 quart baking dish. In a large saucepan over medium heat, cook milk until bubbles form at edges. Slowly stir cornmeal and molasses into milk. Continue to cook and stir until thickened, 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in sugar, salt, ginger and cinnamon. Pour into prepared dish. Bake in preheated oven 2 hours, until set. Serve hot or cold.
