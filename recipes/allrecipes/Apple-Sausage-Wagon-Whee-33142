Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix vegetable oil, egg, brown sugar, quick cooking oats, whole wheat flour, buttermilk, baking powder, salt and baking soda. Place apples and sausage in a medium baking dish or cast iron skillet. Pour the batter mixture over the apples and sausage. Bake 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until crisp and golden brown.
