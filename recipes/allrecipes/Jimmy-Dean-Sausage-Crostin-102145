Preheat oven to 375 F. In large bowl, combine cooked sausage, onion, mozzarella, cream cheese, red pepper, basil, and optional ingredients if desired; mix well. Place sliced bread on baking sheet, brush tops with butter or olive oil and bake until lightly toasted. Remove from oven and top each slice with sausage mixture. Return to oven and bake 7-10 minutes or until topping is hot. Serve warm.
