Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour three 8- inch pans. Mix together the cake mix, 1 cup amaretto flavored creamer, 1 cup amaretto liqueur, eggs and oil until blended. Distribute cake batter evenly between the cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, making certain the cake layers do not overbake. Allow to cool completely before filling. To make the amaretto whipped cream filling: Combine pudding mix, 1/4 cup amaretto liqueur and 1 cup amaretto flavored creamer. Set aside for 5 minutes until thickened. Fold the whipped cream into the amaretto mixture, then stir in the crushed chocolate covered toffee bars. Use to fill and frost top of the cake (do not frost sides). Drizzle cake with melted chocolate candy bar and sprinkle with sliced almonds. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
