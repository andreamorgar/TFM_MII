Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large skillet, saute onion in butter over a medium-low heat until the onion is tender. Add white wine and simmer for 2 minutes. Mix sour cream, mayonnaise, cream cheese, and dried beef into the skillet. Stir continuously until all of the ingredients are melted together. Pour the mixture into an 8 inch baking dish and top with the pecans. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes.
