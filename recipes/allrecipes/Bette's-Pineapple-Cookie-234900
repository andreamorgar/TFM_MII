Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Beat sugar, crushed pineapple, shortening, eggs, and lemon extract together in a bowl until thoroughly mixed. Add flour mixture to pineapple mixture; stir until just combined. Drop dough by teaspoonfuls 2 inches apart onto baking sheets. Bake in batches in the preheated oven until tops are lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes per batch. Transfer to wire racks to cool.
