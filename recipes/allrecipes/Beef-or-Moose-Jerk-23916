Slice roast into slabs approximately 1/4 inch thick, (Note: you can have this done at the grocery store or butcher). Trim off all of the fat from the edges. Cut the slabs into pencil-like strips (about 1/4 inch wide), and about 4 inches long. In a large bowl, combine the soy sauce, brown sugar and hickory-flavored liquid smoke; blend well. Place all of the meat into the bowl of marinade. Cover and place in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Place the meat in a food dehydrator for about 12 to 20 hours, depending how dry you like your jerky. Rotate the trays after 6 hours. For example: Bottom tray on top, top tray on bottom, second tray from bottom to be second tray from top, and so on.
