Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8 or 9 inch round cake pan. In a medium bowl, whip together the eggs and castor sugar until fluffy. Fold in flour. Pour into the prepared pan. Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top of the cake springs back when lightly pressed. Cool in the pan over a wire rack.
