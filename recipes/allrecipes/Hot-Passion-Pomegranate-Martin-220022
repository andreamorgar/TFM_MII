Put ice in pint glass. Pour the lime juice, pepper vodka, simple syrup, orange juice, and passion fruit puree over the ice. Stir the vodka mixture together and strain into a martini glass. Drizzle the pomegranate juice down the inside of the glass to create a color separation. Garnish with the chile pepper slice.
