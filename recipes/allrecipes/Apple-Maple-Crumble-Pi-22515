Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place the apples in an 8x8 inch baking dish. Pour the maple syrup over the apples. In a bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar. Stir in the flour, salt and oats. Sprinkle the oat mixture over the apples. Bake in preheated oven 35 minutes, until golden and bubbly and apples are tender.
