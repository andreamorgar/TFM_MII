In a small saucepan over medium heat, cook the black beans until heated through. Season with salt and pepper. In a large bowl, toss together the cabbage, romaine lettuce, green bell pepper, corn, and Cheddar cheese. Transfer the tossed salad to serving bowls, and top with the warmed black beans, chicken, tortilla chips, and Ranch dressing.
