Stir heavy cream, sweetened condensed milk, milk, mint extract, vanilla extract, and chocolate chips in a bowl until evenly mixed. Pour mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions until softly frozen. Transfer ice cream to a lidded container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, ice cream should ripen in the freezer for at least 2 hours to overnight.
