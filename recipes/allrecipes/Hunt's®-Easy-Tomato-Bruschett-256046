Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place bread slices on a baking sheet. Brush tops with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until lightly toasted. Combine remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, drained tomatoes, basil, garlic, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Divide tomato mixture evenly over toasted bread. Serve immediately.
