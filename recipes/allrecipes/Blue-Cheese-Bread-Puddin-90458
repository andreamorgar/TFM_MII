Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-low heat, and cook the onion and garlic 20 minutes, until soft and golden brown. Arrange 1/2 the bread cubes in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking pan. Layer with 1/2 the blue cheese and the onion mixture. Top with remaining bread cubes and cheese. In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg yolks, heavy cream, salt and pepper. Pour over top layer of bread cubes in pan. Set aside for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake pudding 40 minutes in the preheated oven. Cover pan and continue baking 15 minutes, or until set and golden brown. Allow to sit 15 minutes before serving.
