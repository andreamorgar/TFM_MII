Place Italian sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and set aside. In a large bowl, mix together sausage, tomatoes, green bell peppers, onions, green chile peppers, sour cream and cream cheese. Transfer mixture to a slow cooker. Cook on high heat approximately 1 hour, or until vegetables are soft. Reduce heat and simmer until serving.
