Drain the cherries reserving juice; chop cherries and reserve. Prepare cake mix according to box directions, adding water to the reserved cherry juice to equal the amount of liquid needed for cake mix. Preheat oven to box directions. Fold the cherries and pecans into the cake mix; stirring by hand. Pour mix into 2 round cake pans and bake in preheated oven. When cake has completely cooled, frost with whipped topping; serve and keep unused portions in refrigerator.
