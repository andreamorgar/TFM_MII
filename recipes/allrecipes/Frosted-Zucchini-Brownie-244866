Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a rimmed baking sheet. Whisk white sugar, canola oil, and eggs together in a bowl. Mix flour, 1/4 cup cocoa powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a separate bowl. Stir sugar mixture into flour mixture; add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and mix batter. Fold zucchini and nuts into batter; pour onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool brownies completely. Stir 6 tablespoons cocoa powder and melted butter together in a bowl; stir in confectioners' sugar, milk, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract until frosting is smooth. Spread frosting on brownies.
