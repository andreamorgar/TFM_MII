Wrap the cloves, cinnamon stick, and ginger in cheese cloth, and tie with string. In a medium saucepan, combine sugar, water and spice bag. Simmer and stir until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat, and refrigerate overnight. Before serving, stir in the orange juice, lemon juice, and cider. Reheat over medium low flame, and serve warm. Be careful not to boil.
