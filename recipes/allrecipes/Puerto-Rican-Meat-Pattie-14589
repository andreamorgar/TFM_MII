In a large, heavy saute pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped garlic, onions, and bell pepper; saute until soft. Add meat; cook and stir until browned. Drain off excess fat. Stir in tomato sauce and cilantro. Simmer until cilantro wilts. Remove from heat, and cool until mixture can be handled. Wrap 2 to 3 tablespoons of meat in an egg roll wrapper to form a triangle. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Heat vegetable oil in a wok or deep fry pan to 360 degrees F (168 degrees C). Fry patties in hot oil until golden brown. When done, transfer to plates lined with paper towels to drain.
