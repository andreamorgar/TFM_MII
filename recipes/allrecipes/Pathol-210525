Place the chana dal into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let soak 4 to 6 hours. Drain and rinse. Combine the chana dal, green chile peppers, and salt in a large bowl; mash into a thick and coarse paste. Add water as needed to help mash, but use as little as possible. Heat the oil in a large non-stick skillet. Cook the urad dal, mustard seeds, cumin seeds, dried red chile peppers, curry leaves, and asafoetida powder in the hot oil until the seeds begin to splutter, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the onion and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Stir the chana dal paste into the mixture; cook and stir until the dal is cooked through and tender, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle the cilantro and cayenne pepper over the mixture and stir. Cook another 5 minutes.
