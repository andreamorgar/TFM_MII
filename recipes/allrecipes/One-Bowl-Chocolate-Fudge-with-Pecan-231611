Line an 8-inch square dish with aluminum foil. Stir chocolate and sweetened condensed milk together in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in microwave on High, stirring once or twice until chocolate is soft, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir pecans, vanilla, coffee granules, and sea salt through the chocolate mixture until smooth; spread into the prepared dish. Refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. Cut into squares to serve.
