Bring the water to a boil in a large saucepan. Whisk in the orange gelatin mix, vanilla pudding mix and tapioca pudding mix. Return to a boil and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and allow to cool completely. Fold in mandarin oranges, pineapple and whipped topping. Transfer to a serving bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Fluff the top using a spoon before serving.
