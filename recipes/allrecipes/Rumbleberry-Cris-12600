Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix together rhubarb, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries and sliced apples. In a separate bowl, combine the sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon and nutmeg together and blend with the fruit. Pour fruit mixture into a 9x13 inch glass baking dish. For the topping: In a large bowl, mix the oatmeal, flour, brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together. Add the butter in little pats and cut into the flour mixture until it looks crumbly, (no big chunks). Sprinkle over the fruit. Bake at 400 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 35 minutes, or until topping is brown.
