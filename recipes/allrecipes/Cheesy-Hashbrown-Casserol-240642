Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a glass 9x13-inch baking pan. Combine potatoes, cream of chicken soup, Cheddar cheese, sour cream, 1/2 cup melted butter, onion, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; spread into the prepared baking pan. Mix crushed crackers and 1/2 cup melted butter together in a bowl and sprinkle over potato mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and browned on top, 60 to 90 minutes.
