Place cranberry juice, banana, orange, strawberries, sherbet, ice, and protein powder in the bowl of a blender. Blend on high speed until smooth, about one minute. Adjust the consistency by adding more sherbet if it's too thin, or more cranberry juice if it's too thick. Pour into two glasses and use a straw!
