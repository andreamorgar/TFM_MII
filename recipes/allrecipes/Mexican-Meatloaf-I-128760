Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine the eggs, tomatoes, onion, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper in a large mixing bowl. Gently stir the ground beef and crackers into the egg mixture. Press into a 8x8 inch square baking pan. Bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes. Remove the loaf from the oven, and drain any liquid from the pan. Spread a layer of salsa on top of the loaf, and sprinkle with shredded cheese. Return the loaf to the oven; bake until the meatloaf reaches 160 degrees F (71 degrees C) and is no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes.
