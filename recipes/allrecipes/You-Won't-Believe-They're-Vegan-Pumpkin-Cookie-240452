Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with baking parchment. Beat pumpkin puree, sugar, coconut oil, cinnamon, sea salt, nutmeg, allspice, ginger, and cloves together until smooth. Stir flour and baking soda into the pumpkin mixture to make a dough. Mix pecan pieces into the dough. Scoop spoonfuls of the dough onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned and no longer gooey in the middle, 15 to 17 minutes. Let cookies cool on sheet for 10 minutes before moving to wire cooling racks to cool completely.
