Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine beef, bread crumbs, egg, mustard, salt and pepper; mix well. On a sheet of waxed paper, pat out beef mixture into a large rectangle. Cover the surface with slices of cheese. Starting with the short side of the rectangle, roll up and remove waxed paper simultaneously. Place in a shallow baking dish. In a small bowl, mix together ketchup, water, and Worcestershire sauce; pour over beef. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour and 10 minutes.
