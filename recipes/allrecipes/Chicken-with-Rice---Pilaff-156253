Place chicken in a large soup pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Stir in the salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning; boil for 1 hour, skimming fat from water occasionally. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt the butter over low heat in a large skillet. Add the rice and cook, stirring, for 10 minutes. Transfer rice to a large roasting pan. Pour the broth from the chicken into the roasting pan; top with the chicken. Bake in the preheated oven until rice is cooked, about 30 minutes.
