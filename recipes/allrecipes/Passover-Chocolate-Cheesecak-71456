Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a small bowl, stir together the crushed macaroons and butter. Press into the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven; remove and cool. In a medium bowl, stir cream cheese and sugar together until well blended. Stir in matzo meal, milk and vanilla until smooth. Mix in the eggs one at a time. Combine the chocolate chips and butter in a small microwave-safe dish. Heat at 30 second intervals until melted, stirring at each interval. Stir into the cream cheese batter. Pour the batter over the cooled crust and smooth the top. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes, or until the center appears solid when jiggled slightly.
