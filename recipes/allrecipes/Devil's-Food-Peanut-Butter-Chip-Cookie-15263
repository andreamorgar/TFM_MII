Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium bowl, beat the eggs, vanilla, and shortening with 1/2 of the cake mix until light and fluffy. Mix in the remaining cake mix and the peanut butter chips. Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in preheated oven. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.
