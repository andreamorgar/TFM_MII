Melt the white chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30 second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave). Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch. Stir in the cinnamon. Spread the mixture thinly on wax paper into a 9 inch square, then place onto a baking sheet. Freeze until hard, about 5 minutes. Remove from the freezer and crush the white chocolate into small pieces and place into a bowl. Melt the semisweet chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30 second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave). Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch. Skewer each apple slice with a fork. Dip the apple into the semisweet chocolate, wiping off excess, then dip the apple into the white chocolate pieces. Carefully remove the fork and place the chocolate dipped apple slices onto a plate covered with wax paper. Refrigerate until hard, about 45 minutes.
