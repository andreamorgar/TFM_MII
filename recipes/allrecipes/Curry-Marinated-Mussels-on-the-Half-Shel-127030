In a 12-inch skillet heat remaining tablespoon oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and saute vegetables, stirring and adding salt to taste, until slightly softened but not browned. Add vegetables to curry mixture. In skillet steam mussels in 1/4 cup water, covered, over moderately high heat, 3 to 8 minutes, checking occasionally after 3 minutes and transferring them as they open to another bowl. Discard any unopened mussels. Remove mussels from shells and add to curry-vegetable mixture, gently tossing to coat. Wash and reserve half of each shell. Marinate mussels, covered and chilled, at least 2 hours and up to 1 day. Just before serving, chop cilantro and stir into mussels. Fill each reserved shell with a mussel and some curried vegetables.
