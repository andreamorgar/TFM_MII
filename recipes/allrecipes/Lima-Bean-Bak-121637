Cook the lima beans according to package directions. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup liquid; set beans and liquid aside. In a skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Add tomato sauce, brown sugar, salt, poultry seasoning and reserved bean liquid. Place the beans in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Top with tomato mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until bubbly. Stir before serving.
