Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 1 large loaf pan. Blend bananas, chickpeas, butter, dates, almond flour, honey, eggs, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and salt together in a blender or food processor until batter is smooth. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a knife inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in pan for 15 minutes before slicing.
