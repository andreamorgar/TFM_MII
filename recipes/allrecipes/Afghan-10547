In small cup, cover chopped dates with boiling water and let soak for 10 - 15 minutes. (If necessary, add additional boiling water to cover.) Drain liquid and discard. Combine flour, cocoa and baking powder and set aside. In a large bowl, cream shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in dates and beat in vanilla extract. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients. Fold in corn flakes. Break off pieces of dough (walnut sized). Roll into balls and place 1-1/2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 12 - 15 minutes or until firm. Cool on wire racks.
