In a medium-size pot, place one inch of water, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and eggplant. Cover pot and cook 15 minutes, or until eggplant is tender. Drain well. Chop the cooked eggplant. In a large bowl, combine eggplant, onion, green pepper, 3/4 cup bread crumbs, 1 egg, cheese, paprika, pepper and remaining salt. Cool and chill 2 to 3 hours or overnight. Place flour in a bowl. Beat the remaining egg in a separate small bowl. Drop mixture by heaping teaspoonfuls into the flour and coat completely. Then dip the eggplant balls into the beaten egg; finally, coat the balls with the remaining bread crumbs. In a large skillet, heat vegetable oil and fry eggplant balls until they are heated through.
