In a shallow bowl, combine soy sauce, brown sugar, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, onion, ginger and pepper. Coat steak with marinade, cover, and refrigerate for at least 6 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate. Grill steak for 7 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.
