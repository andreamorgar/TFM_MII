Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack at about 6 inches from the heat source. Slice the top and bottom off the pineapple. Cut into quarters and remove the core from each piece. Lay each section skin side down and, using a sharp knife, separate the fruit along the skin, allowing the fruit to rest on the skin for presentation. Cut the fruit into slices for easy eating. Place on a baking sheet and sprinkle each section with 2 tablespoons each of brown sugar and coconut. Broil until the coconut is toasted, about 5 minutes.
