Place 1/4 cup shredded coconut in a shallow bowl. Line a large plate with parchment paper. Combine almond butter, 1/4 cup of the shredded coconut, almonds, coconut oil, and honey in a bowl; mix until a firm paste forms. Form almond butter mixture into balls, roll in shredded coconut, and place on the lined plate. Chill until firm, 2 to 3 hours.
