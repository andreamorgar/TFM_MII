Combine the sugars, flour, cinnamon, cloves, and salt in a bowl. Add the eggs and yolk one at a time, and mix well. Stir in the milk, melted butter, and vanilla. Pour filling into the shell. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 40 to 45 minutes. When the side of the pan is tapped, the center should still wobble like gelatin. Cool on a rack.
