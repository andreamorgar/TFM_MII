Place the carrots in a saucepan with about 1 inch of water in the bottom. Bring to a boil, and cook for about 5 minutes. Drain, and set aside. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish. Place the carrots in the dish. In a medium bowl, stir together the onion, mayonnaise, horseradish, pepper, paprika and bread crumbs. Spread evenly over the carrots. Bake uncovered for 15 minutes, or until the top is nicely browned.
