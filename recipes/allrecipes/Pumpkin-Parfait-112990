Combine the marshmallow creme, cream cheese, and 1 tablespoon orange juice concentrate in a large bowl; beat with an electric hand mixer until smooth. Stir together the pumpkin, syrup, cinnamon, nutmeg, and 1 tablespoon orange juice in a separate bowl. Fold 1/4 cup of the marshmallow creme mixture into the pumpkin mixture. Beginning with the cream cheese mixture, layer 3 tablespoons of each mixture in each of four dessert cups. Chill in refrigerator for 2 hours. Top with pecans and gingersnaps before serving.
