Brush one layer with milk and place the other layer on top. Peel off waxed paper and roll up like a jelly roll. Chill dough thoroughly. To Make Half and Half: Make two rolls, 2 inches thick. One plain and one chocolate. Wrap in waxed paper and chill. Cut each roll in half lengthwise. Brush cut edges with milk. Press plain and chocolate halves together to make rolls. Wrap in waxed paper and chill again. Slice cookies thinly and bake in a preheated 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) oven for 8 to 10 minutes
