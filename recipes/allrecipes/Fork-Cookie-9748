Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cream the butter and 2 tablespoons of sugar until light and fluffy, then stir in the egg yolk. Add the flour and mix until well blended. Combine the 1/2 cup sugar with the cinnamon. Roll the dough into balls the size of small olives and roll in the sugar/cinnamon mixture.
