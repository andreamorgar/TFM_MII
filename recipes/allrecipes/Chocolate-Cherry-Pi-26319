Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C.) In a medium bowl, combine crumbs, and 1/4 cup softened butter. Press onto the bottom and sides of an 8 inch pie pan. Bake in preheated oven for 8 minutes. Cool. In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave chocolate until melted. Stir occasionally until chocolate is smooth. Set aside. In a large bowl, cream 1/2 cup butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Blend in melted chocolate, salt and vanilla. Add eggs, one at a time, beating 5 minutes for each egg. Stir in chopped cherries. Spread into cooled crust. Chill 4 hours. Before serving, garnish pie with whipped cream and maraschino cherries.
