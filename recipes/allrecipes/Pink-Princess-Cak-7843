Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 9 or 10 inch bundt or tube pan. Combine the cake mix, gelatin, flour, eggs and thawed strawberries. Beat at medium speed of an electric mixer for 3 minutes. Add the oil and beat for one more minute. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 to 40 minutes. Let cake cool before frosting or serving.
