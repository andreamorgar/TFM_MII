Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large, deep skillet, crumble the sausage and cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain well. In a medium bowl, stir together the sausage, Cheddar cheese and baking mix. Form the mixture into 1 1/2 inch balls and arrange on a large ungreased cookie sheet. Bake in the preheated oven 10 to 15 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly and baking mix is golden brown.
