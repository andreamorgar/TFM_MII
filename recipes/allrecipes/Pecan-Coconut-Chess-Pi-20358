Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together cornmeal, sugar, flour, lemon juice, vanilla and margarine. Mix in eggs until well blended. Stir in coconut and pecans. Then pour mixture into pie crust. Bake in preheated oven for 50 to 55 minutes. Be sure to cover pie with foil. Take off foil when there are 10 to 15 minutes left of bake time. Pie will be somewhat "shaky" when removed from oven, but will firm up as it cools.
