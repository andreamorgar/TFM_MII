Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Line a broiler pan with aluminum foil. Place the cod fillets on the foil, and brush with butter. Season with lemon juice, tarragon, and black pepper; sprinkle with sesame seeds. Broil the fish in the preheated broiler until the flesh turns opaque and white, and the fish flakes easily, about 10 minutes.
