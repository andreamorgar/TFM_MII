Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8 inch baking dish. In a food processor, blend sunflower seeds, whole wheat flour, nutritional yeast, salt, vegetable oil, lemon juice, potato, carrot, onion, celery, garlic, water, thyme, basil, sage, savory, pepper and dry mustard. Process the mixture until almost smooth. Transfer mixture to the baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven 1 hour, or until bubbly and lightly browned.
