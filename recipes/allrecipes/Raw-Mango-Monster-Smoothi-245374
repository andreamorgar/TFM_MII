Blend flax seeds in a blender until finely ground; add pepitas and blend until ground, about 1 minute. Place mango, banana, water, ice cubes, and kale in the blender; blend until smooth, kale is fully incorporated, and the smoothie is uniform in color, about 3 minutes. Thin with more water to reach desired consistency.
