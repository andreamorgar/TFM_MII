Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease. Beat eggs together in a bowl until thick and lemon-colored. Gradually add sugar to eggs while continually beating. Pour oil into egg-sugar mixture and beat until smooth. Mix gluten-free all-purpose flour mix, rice-based flour mix, baking soda, and xanthan gum together in a separate bowl; gradually stir into egg-sugar mixture until dough is well-mixed and sticky. Fold almonds into the dough. Turn dough onto the prepared baking sheet and form into 2 loaves, 1/2-inch thick and 2 1/2 inches wide. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Cool loaves on the baking sheet for 2 minutes; slice into 1/2-inch slices. Lay slices, cut-side down, on baking sheet. Bake in the oven until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer biscotti to a wire rack to cool completely.
