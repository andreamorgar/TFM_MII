Heat vegetable oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). In a large mixing bowl, combine corn meal, baking powder, salt, milk, and water. Mix in egg and chopped onion. Shape the batter into small balls, approximately 1 tablespoon each. Use a long handled spoon to gently slide the hush puppies into the hot oil. Cook 8 or 10 at a time, until golden brown. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon, and roll on paper towels to briefly drain. Serve hot.
