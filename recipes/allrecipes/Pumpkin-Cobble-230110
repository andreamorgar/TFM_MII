Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8-inch square baking dish with cooking spray. Whisk sugar and eggs together in a bowl until light; stir pumpkin, evaporated milk, orange extract, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt into egg mixture. Pour pumpkin mixture into the prepared baking dish. Lightly sprinkle cake mix over the top, covering pumpkin mixture completely. Slowly drizzle melted butter over the cake mix so it doesn't puddle. Bake in the preheated oven until the pumpkin mixture is set and topping is golden brown, 50 minutes to 1 hour.
