In a blender, combine pineapple chunks, pineapple juice and coconut extract. Puree until smooth. Then, with the blender running, drop ice cubes one at a time into the opening in the lid of the blender. Make sure each cube is crushed before adding the next. Blend to desired texture. Serve in tall glasses.
