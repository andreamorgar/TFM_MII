Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix almond milk, protein powder, peanut butter, egg whites, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth. Pour into a 9-inch square baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Let cool, about 5 minutes, before cutting into 10 squares.
