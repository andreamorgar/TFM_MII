Grease a large bowl and a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place cereal in the prepared bowl. Combine marshmallows, brown sugar, corn syrup, cocoa powder, and butter in a small saucepan; cook and stir over medium-low heat until smooth and bubbling. Remove saucepan from heat and stir in vanilla extract. Pour chocolate mixture over cereal and stir until evenly coated. Press cereal mixture into the prepared baking dish and cool for 10 minutes. Turn cereal mixture onto a work surface and cut into 12 or 24 squares using a serrated knife. Individually wrap squares in plastic wrap or store in an airtight container.
