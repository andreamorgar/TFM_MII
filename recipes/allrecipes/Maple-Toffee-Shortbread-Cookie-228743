Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Mix butter, brown sugar, and maple extract together in a bowl until smooth. Add flour; stir to combine. Fold in toffee bits. Spoon batter, about 1 tablespoon per cookie, onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, about 15 minutes.
