Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a non-stick baking sheet. Whisk flour and baking soda together in a bowl. Beat margarine and sugar together in a separate bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; beat in egg until evenly combined. Stir flour mixture into margarine mixture until dough is just combined; stir in vinegar. Turn dough onto a floured surface and roll into an 1/8-inch thick rectangle. Cut dough into ghost shapes using the cookie cutter. Arrange ghosts on the prepared baking sheet. Prick holes into each ghost using a clean pin. Sprinkle ghosts with salt. Bake in the preheated oven until crackers are golden brown, 6 to 10 minutes. Allow crackers to cool completely. Spread peanut butter onto cooled crackers.
