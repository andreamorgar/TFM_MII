Stir mustard, horseradish, basil, thyme, tarragon, and black pepper together in a small bowl; spread evenly over one side and around the edges of the steaks. Wrap steaks individually with plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 to 24 hours. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking dish with aluminum foil and set a roasting rack into the dish. Remove steak from plastic wrap; season with salt. Put steaks onto the roasting rack. Cook the steaks until they start to firm, and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).
