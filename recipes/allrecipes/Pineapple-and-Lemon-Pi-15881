Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Roll out half of pastry to line pie pan, and roll out other half to cut into strips for lattice top. In a medium mixing bowl combine eggs, sugar, flour, salt, lemon juice, and grated lemon rind. Mix well then stir in pineapple. Spread filling into pastry-lined pie pan, make lattice top, and crimp edges. Place in preheated oven and bake 40 minutes or until filling is set and crust is lightly browned. Chill before serving.
