Thoroughly mix crushed lemon cookies and butter together in a bowl. Press cookie mixture into the bottom of an 8-inch springform pan. Place blueberries and sugar in a saucepan over medium-low heat; simmer until sugar has dissolved and a thin sauce forms, 10 minutes. Stir cornstarch into blueberry sauce; simmer until sauce has thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool for 10 minutes. Stir mascarpone, lemon curd, and whipped topping together in a bowl until well blended and smooth. Spread mascarpone mixture over the crust in the springform pan. Cover with waxed paper and freeze until semi-firm, about 10 minutes. Spread blueberry sauce over mascarpone layer; cover with waxed paper and refrigerate until set, at least 1 hour.
