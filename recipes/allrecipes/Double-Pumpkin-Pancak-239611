Heat a skillet over medium-low heat. Cook and stir pumpkin seeds in the hot skillet until toasted, about 5 minutes. Mix toasted pumpkin seeds, whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl using a whisk. Beat milk, pumpkin puree, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, egg, and sugar together in a separate bowl using a whisk until smooth; mix into flour mixture until batter is smooth. Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a non-stick pan over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls into the pan and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
