Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a 9x13-inch baking dish. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the egg noodles, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain well. Melt butter in the pot, and stir together the drained noodles, cottage cheese, salt, and applesauce. Mix in the sugar and cinnamon. Add the beaten eggs; stir to blend all ingredients. Pour mixture into prepared baking dish. Bake until top is very brown, about 1 hour.
