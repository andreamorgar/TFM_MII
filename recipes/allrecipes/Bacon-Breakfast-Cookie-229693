Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix flour, sugar, and baking soda in a bowl. Stir in bacon bits, butter, and egg until well blended. Fold corn flakes and Cheddar cheese into flour mixture. Drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 13 to 15 minutes.
