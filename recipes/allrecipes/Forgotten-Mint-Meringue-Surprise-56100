Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. Combine egg whites, cream of tartar, salt, vanilla extract, peppermint extract, and green food coloring in a large bowl. Use an electric mixer to beat until soft peaks form. Beat sugar into egg whites one tablespoon at a time. Continue to beat until stiff peaks form, and mixture is glossy and very smooth, 4 to 5 minutes. Drop the meringue by half teaspoons onto prepared cookie sheet; top with chocolate kisses. Spoon a scant teaspoon of meringue over chocolate, and smooth to cover completely. Place cookies in the preheated oven; turn oven off. Leave meringues in oven overnight, or until oven has cooled completely.
