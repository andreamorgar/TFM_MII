Meanwhile, prick sausages with a fork; place in greased 13x9-inch baking dish. Bake in preheated oven, turning sausages once, for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden. Drain off all but 2 tablespoons fat. Remove from oven; increase temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Whisk batter; pour over sausages. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until puffed and golden.
