Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 40 muffin cups with cooking spray. Combine sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl. Brush both sides of flour tortilla pieces with melted butter; sprinkle each with cinnamon-sugar mixture. Gently fit each tortilla piece into a prepared muffin cup, shaping the tortilla to make a shell. Bake in the preheated oven until tortilla shells are golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Beat milk, cream cheese, and pudding mix in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth; fold in whipped topping. Fill each tortilla shell with about 1 tablespoon cream cheese mixture. Drizzle with chocolate syrup and top each with a maraschino cherry.
