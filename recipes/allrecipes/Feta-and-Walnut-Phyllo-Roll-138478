Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Blend feta, walnuts, Aleppo flakes, and a pinch of salt in a food processor until a ball begins to form. Form into 27 (1-inch) balls, then roll balls into 2 1/2-inch logs. Leave phyllo sheets stacked and cut lengthwise into thirds, then stack thirds into 1 pile. Cover with plastic wrap and a dampened kitchen towel. Place 1 sheet of phyllo with a short end nearest you on a work surface (keep remaining sheets covered) and brush with butter. Place a feta log in center of phyllo sheet parallel to short end. Fold phyllo in half, enclosing log, and brush with butter. Starting at end with log, roll up pastry to resemble a cigar. Transfer, seam side down, to a lightly buttered baking sheet, then make 26 more rolls in same manner. Brush rolls with some butter and bake in middle of oven until golden, about 25 minutes. Cool on baking sheet on a rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.
