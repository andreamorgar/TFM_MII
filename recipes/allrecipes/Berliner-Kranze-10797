Cream together 1 cup sugar with butter or margarine, and shortening. Beat in 2 eggs and add orange peel. Sift flour and gradually blend into sugar mixture. Dough should hold together and not be crumbly. Take a walnut sized piece of dough, and roll in palms of hand to create a 4 to 6 inch rope. Bring ends together to form a circle, and fold ends over each other. Brush with a mixture made from beaten egg white and 2 teaspoons sugar; this makes a glossy finish. Add green citron slices for "leaves" and 1/2 red citron cherry for" berry" - use to decorate at the knot. Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) on ungreased cookie sheets for 10 to 12 minutes. Bake only until cookies are light brown on bottom - just barely baked.
