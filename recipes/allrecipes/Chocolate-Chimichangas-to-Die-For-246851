Mix confectioners' sugar and cinnamon together on a large, flat plate. Place tortillas on a flat work surface. Place 1/4 cup chocolate chips on the edge closest to you. Fold in opposing edges and roll tortilla up tightly like a burrito. Heat oil in a deep saucepan over medium-high heat. Fry rolled tortillas in hot oil in batches, partially covered, using tongs to rotate them until they are golden brown on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes. Roll in sugar mixture until coated on all sides.
