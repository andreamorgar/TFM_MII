Pour the gelatin mix into a large bowl, and stir in the boiling water until the gelatin has dissolved. Refrigerate until set, about 3 hours. Make a layer of graham crackers in the bottom of a glass 9x13 inch baking dish. Spoon a layer of gelatin over the graham crackers, and top with a layer of crushed pineapple. Cover with a layer of whipped topping. Repeat the layers all the way to the top of the pan, ending with whipped topping on top. Refrigerate for a few hours before serving to let the graham crackers absorb the flavors of orange and pineapple.
