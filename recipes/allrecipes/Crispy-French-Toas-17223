Heat deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large bowl combine eggs, milk, sugar, cinnamon and vanilla; beat well. Place cornflakes in a separate bowl. Dip bread slices in egg mixture and press into cornflakes. Carefully slide coated bread slices into hot oil. Fry on each side until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and serve hot.
