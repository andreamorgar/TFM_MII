Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease 36 miniature muffin cups with coconut oil. Whisk eggs, ghee, pumpkin puree, maple syrup, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Stir coconut flour, baking soda, and sea salt into egg mixture just until batter is combined. Fold frozen blueberries into batter. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups. Press 1 fresh blueberry on top of each muffin. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 25 minutes.
