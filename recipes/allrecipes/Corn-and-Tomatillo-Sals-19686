In a large skillet, combine the corn kernels and jalapeno peppers. Cook and stir for 10 minutes, until the jalapenos are soft. In a saucepan over high heat, combine the corn and jalapeno mixture with the tomatillos, green bell peppers, green onions, lime juice, water and coriander. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer 5 minutes, stirring once. Remove from heat. Cool for 10 minutes. Stir in the cilantro. Allow the mixture to cool in the refrigerator. Serve with tortilla chips.
