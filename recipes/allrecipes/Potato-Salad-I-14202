Place potatoes in a medium saucepan with enough water to cover. Add 2 teaspoons salt. Bring to a boil; cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain, and allow to cool until easily handled but still warm. Cut potatoes into bite size pieces, and transfer to a medium mixing bowl. Add salad dressing, and gently stir until well coated. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve warm.
