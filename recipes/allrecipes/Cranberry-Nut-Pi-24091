Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C.) Butter a 9 inch pie plate and layer cranberries on the bottom. Sprinkle with brown sugar and chopped walnuts. In a large bowl, beat egg until thick. Gradually add sugar, beating until thoroughly blended. Stir in flour and melted butter. Blend well and pour over cranberries. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve warm.
