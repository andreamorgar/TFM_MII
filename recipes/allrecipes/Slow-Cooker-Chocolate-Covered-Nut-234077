Pour peanuts into your slow cooker. Layer sweet baking chocolate over the peanuts. Spread milk chocolate chips onto the baking chocolate. Finish with a layer of white almond bar pieces. Cook on Low for 2 hours before stirring to mix evenly. Line baking sheets with waxed paper or baking parchment. Drop spoonfuls of the peanut mixture onto the prepared baking sheets. Set aside until the candies harden. Store covered in a cool place.
