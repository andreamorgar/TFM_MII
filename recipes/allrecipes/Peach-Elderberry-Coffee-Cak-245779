Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Beat 1/2 cup plus 6 tablespoons butter, 3/4 cup brown sugar, and white sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, honey, lemon juice, and vanilla extract until smooth. Sift 3 cups flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl; beat into butter and sugar mixture until incorporated. Beat in milk until smooth batter forms. Fold in elderberries and peaches just until combined. Spread batter evenly into prepared baking dish. Whisk 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup flour together in a separate bowl. Cut in 1/4 cup butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; sprinkle over batter. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.
