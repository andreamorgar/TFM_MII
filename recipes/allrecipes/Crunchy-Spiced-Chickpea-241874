Place chickpeas in a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand for 24 hours. Drain and dry on paper towels. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Pour chickpeas into a baking dish; drizzle olive oil over the top and season with cumin, paprika, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Stir to coat chickpeas. Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 20 minutes, until crispy and fragrant, about 1 hour. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
