Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Mix bread crumbs, olive oil, oregano, basil, rosemary, and garlic powder in a resealable plastic bag. Add pork tenderloin, seal bag, and shake until pork is coated. Place coated pork on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until pork is cooked through, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let pork rest for 10 minutes before cutting into 1/2-inch thick slices.
