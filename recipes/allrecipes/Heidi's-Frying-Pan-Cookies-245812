Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add dates, sugar, and eggs; cook and stir until mixture thickens and leaves the sides of the skillet, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat; add crispy rice cereal and pecans. Stir cookie dough until well-mixed. Place coconut in a shallow bowl. Drop teaspoonfuls of cookie dough into coconut and roll to coat and form into balls. Let cookies cool, about 20 minutes.
