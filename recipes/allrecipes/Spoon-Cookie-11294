Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Cream the butter or margarine with the white sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the vanilla and eggs and mix well. Stir in the baking powder and flour. Drop dough by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets. In a small bowl beat milk into the confectioners' sugar a tablespoon at a time until it is of a drizzling consistency. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 10 minutes. Let cookies cool then drizzle with confectioners' sugar and milk glaze then sprinkle with candy sprinkles.
