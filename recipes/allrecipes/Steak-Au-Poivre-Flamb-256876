Grind peppercorns coarsely using a coffee grinder or mortar and pestle. Season steaks on both sides with peppercorns and salt. Heat butter and oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Cook steaks until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer steaks to a plate and tent with aluminum foil. Remove skillet from heat and drain grease. Pour in 1/3 cup brandy. Light brandy carefully using a long match. Shake skillet back and forth until flames die down, about 30 seconds. Return skillet to medium heat. Whisk in cream; bring to a simmer. Cook, whisking occasionally, until sauce coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in 1 teaspoon brandy. Return steaks to the skillet; cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.
