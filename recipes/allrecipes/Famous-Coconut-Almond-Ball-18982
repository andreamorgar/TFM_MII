Line two cookie sheets or large flat surface with waxed paper and place large cooling rack on top. Place coconut in large bowl. Heat corn syrup, one minute in microwave, until syrup boils. Pour immediately over coconut and stir until well mixed. Using a tablespoon measure, shape coconut into 26 balls with hands and place on wire racks. Let rest 10 minutes, then re-roll each ball to keep loose ends from sticking out. Melt shortening and chocolate together in large glass bowl in microwave, or in saucepan on stovetop, stirring once or twice. Working quickly, spoon 1 tablespoon of chocolate over each ball. Lightly press an almond on top of each ball. Let balls stand until set.
