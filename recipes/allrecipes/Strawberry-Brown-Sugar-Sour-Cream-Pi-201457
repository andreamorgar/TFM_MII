Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Combine the egg, 3/4 cup brown sugar, white sugar, sour cream, and 1/4 cup wheat flour in a bowl. Place the strawberry slices in the pie crust, and spoon the sour cream mixture over the berries. In another bowl, stir together 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup flour. Pour in the melted butter, and stir until mixture resembles course meal. Sprinkle this mixture over sour cream mixture and berries in the pie shell. Place pie on lowest rack in preheated oven. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake for 45 minutes longer. Remove from the oven, and let it cool completely (yes, overnight works best).
