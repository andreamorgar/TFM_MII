Prepare the chai tea using one packet or two tablespoons of dry mix stirred into 3/4 cup hot water. Allow to cool for about 10 minutes. Combine the chai tea, Chardonnay, vanilla extract, egg yolk, frozen raspberries, and butter in the pan of a bread machine. Add the bread flour, rye flour, all-purpose flour, wheat bran, yeast, walnuts, caraway seed, sugar, and salt. Select the "Sweet" setting with a "Light Crust" and press Start. When the bread has finished baking, allow it to cool for at least 30 minutes before slicing and serving.
