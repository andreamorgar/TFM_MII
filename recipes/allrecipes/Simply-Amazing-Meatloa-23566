Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a mixing bowl, combine ground beef, Spanish rice and sauce mix, eggs, 1 tablespoon of ketchup, and mustard. Mix thoroughly. Coat the inside of a 9x5 inch loaf pan with 2 tablespoons of the ketchup. Transfer the meat mixture to the loaf pan. Top with the remaining ketchup. Bake in a preheated oven for 1 hour or until cooked through.
