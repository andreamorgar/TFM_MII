Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat all ingredients together very well and pour into a 9 inch unbaked pie shell. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes. Pie will quiver. This is ok! The top will be puffed up when you remove the pie from the oven and will fall down after it has cooled. This is ok, too! Best served at room temperature.
