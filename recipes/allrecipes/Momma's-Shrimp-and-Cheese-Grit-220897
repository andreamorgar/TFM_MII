Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; stir grits and salt into the boiling water, cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer grits until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and keep warm. Melt 1/4 cup butter in a pan over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in green onions, cooking until green onions are wilted, another 4 minutes. Mix shrimp into the garlic and green onions and cook until shrimp are firm and pink, about 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Just before serving, mix 1/4 cup butter into the cooked grits, followed by processed cheese. Mix thoroughly until creamy and cheese is melted. Season with salt and black pepper. Place grits in a bowl, top with the shrimp, and pour pan sauce over shrimp and grits to serve.
