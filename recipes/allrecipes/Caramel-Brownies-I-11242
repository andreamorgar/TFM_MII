Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 9x13 inch baking dish. Melt caramels and 1/3 cup of the evaporated milk over very low heat, stirring occasionally until smooth. Combine cake mix, melted butter, the remaining 1/3 cup evaporated milk, vanilla and nuts. Mix well and spread 1/2 of the batter into the prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 8 minutes. Sprinkle the chocolate chips evenly over the partially cooked brownies. Pour the melted caramel mixture over the top and with a teaspoon drop the remaining 1/2 of the batter evenly over the top. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 minutes. Let brownies cool in pan then cut into bars.
