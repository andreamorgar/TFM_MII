Stir water and gelatin together in a bowl until gelatin dissolves. Combine milk, sugar, and black sesame paste in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until sugar melts, 2 to 4 minutes. Stir gelatin mixture into milk mixture; cook and stir pudding for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Chill pudding in the saucepan at room temperature for 5 minutes. Pour pudding into small bowls and refrigerate until chilled and set, about 2 hours.
