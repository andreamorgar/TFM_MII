Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir taco seasoning into the ground beef to coat. Bring beer to a boil in a small saucepan. Melt butter in a large saucepan. Stir flour into melted butter; cook, stirring continually, until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Slowly stir beer into the butter mixture. Add Mexican cheese blend and white Cheddar cheese in small amounts, stirring continually, allowing each addition to melt into the beer mixture before adding the next. Stir beef into the cheesy mixture.
