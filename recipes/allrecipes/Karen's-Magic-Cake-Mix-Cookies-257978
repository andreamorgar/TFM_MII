Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine cake mix, white chocolate chips, toffee chips, eggs, vegetable oil, and brown sugar in a large bowl; mix until dough comes together. Form dough into 2-inch balls. Pour confectioners' sugar into a shallow bowl. Roll each ball of dough in the confectioners' sugar until coated. Arrange on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are firm, 8 to 10 minutes.
