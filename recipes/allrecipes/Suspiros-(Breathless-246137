Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Place tapioca flour in a large bowl. Add sugar, butter, eggs, cinnamon, and salt. Mix well until a soft dough forms. Pinch off a small piece of dough and roll out into a rope the length of a pencil on your work surface; coil tightly into a spiral. Repeat with remaining dough. Arrange spirals on baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked on the bottom but still pale on top, about 15 minutes.
