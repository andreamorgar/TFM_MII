Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease 2 mini fluted Bundt(R) pans with cooking spray. Combine sugar, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla extract in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Add pumpkin puree; beat until well blended. Mix flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and ginger powder together in another bowl. Mix into pumpkin mixture. Fold chocolate chips into the batter. Pour batter into the prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
