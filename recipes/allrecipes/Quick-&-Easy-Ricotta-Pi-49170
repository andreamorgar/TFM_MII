Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). On a lightly floured surface, roll out one crust, and place in a 9 inch pie plate. Roll out top crust, and cut into lattice strips; set aside. In a large bowl, blend ricotta, eggs, sugar, and whiskey. Pour into pie crust. Top with lattice strips in a woven pattern. Seal and crimp edge. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until crust is golden brown and filling is set.
