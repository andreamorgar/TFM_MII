Grease a 13x9-inch baking dish with butter. Cut bread slices into quarters. Arrange half the bread into the bottom and up the sides of the prepared dish in an even layer to cover completely. Mix ham and Cheddar cheese in bowl; spread over the bread layer and top with remaining bread. Beat milk, eggs, and mustard together in a bowl until smooth; pour over the bread to soak completely. Put corn flakes cereal into a bowl; drizzle melted butter over the cereal and stir to coat. Spread coated cereal over the top of the casserole. Cover casserole with plastic wrap and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bake in preheated oven until the corn flakes are browned, about 1 hour.
