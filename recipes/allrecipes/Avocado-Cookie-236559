Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat sugar, butter, and avocado together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth. Add eggs and beat until incorporated. Whisk flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl; stir into avocado mixture until dough is well mixed. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls. Arrange balls, 2-inches apart, on a non-stick baking sheet. Flatten dough slightly. Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms of cookies are lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool cookies on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
