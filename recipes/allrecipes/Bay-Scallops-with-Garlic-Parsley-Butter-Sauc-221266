Spread 1/2 tablespoon butter on one side of each piece of toasted Italian bread. Set aside. Heat olive oil in a skillet over high heat. When oil begins to smoke, pour scallops into pan. Cook for 30 seconds without stirring. Toss scallops in pan and stir in garlic. Cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir wine and lemon juice into scallops, bring to a boil, and cook for about 30 seconds. Stir parsley and cold butter into scallops and remove from heat. When butter melts, stir in salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Spoon scallops over buttered toast and serve immediately.
