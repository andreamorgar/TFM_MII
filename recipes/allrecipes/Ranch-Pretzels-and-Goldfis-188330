Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Stir the popcorn oil, ranch dressing mix, dill weed, garlic powder, lemon pepper, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl; add the pretzels and fish crackers and stir to coat evenly. Spread the mixture onto two jelly roll pans. Bake in the preheated oven, stirring once, until lightly toasted, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer mixture to a flat surface lined with waxed paper to cool.
