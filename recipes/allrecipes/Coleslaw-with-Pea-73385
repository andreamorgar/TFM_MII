In a large bowl, mix the peas, cabbage, and green onion. In a separate bowl, mix the sour cream, mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, salt, and curry powder. Pour the sour cream mixture over the cabbage mixture, and toss to coat. Cover, and refrigerate at least 1 hour, or overnight. Sprinkle with peanuts to serve.
