Poke each potato with the tines of a fork. Place the potatoes in a microwave oven, and cook on high power for about 5 minutes. Check about halfway through, and turn potatoes over for even cooking. Slice each potato in half the long way and cook potatoes another 2 minutes on high power. Preheat a grill for medium heat. Brush the potato tops with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook on prepared grill for 15 to 20 minutes, turning once.
