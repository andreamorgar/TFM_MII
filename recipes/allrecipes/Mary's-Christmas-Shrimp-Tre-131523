Wrap a 9 inch tall Styrofoam cone with aluminum foil, covering completely. Use toothpicks to attach beet greens, with the undersides facing outward, to the cone. Cut off the exposed pieces of toothpick with strong scissors. Place the slice of cheese on a dry serving plate. Set the cone onto the cheese to anchor. Use frilly toothpicks to attach shrimp, baby corn, black olives, green olives and jalapeno slices to the cone to look like decorations. Scatter any leftover vegetables around the base of the tree. Serve with your choice of colorful purchased dipping sauces, like cocktail sauce, remoulade sauce, or guacamole.
