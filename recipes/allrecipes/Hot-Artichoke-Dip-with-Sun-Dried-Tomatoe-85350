Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8-inch baking dish. In a medium bowl, mix together the Parmesan cheese, mayonnaise, and garlic powder. Stir in the artichokes, green onions, and sun-dried tomatoes. Mix well, and transfer to the prepared baking dish. Bake in a preheated oven until lightly browned, about 25 minutes. Sprinkle with paprika, and serve.
