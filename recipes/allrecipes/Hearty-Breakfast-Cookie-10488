Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two baking sheets or line them with parchment paper. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat together butter, peanut butter, brown sugar, and vanilla until creamy. Beat in eggs and water. Mix together flours, oats, wheat germ, salt, cinnamon, and baking soda. Mix into peanut butter mixture. Stir in raisins or dates (see Cook's Note). Drop by ice cream scoopfuls 2 1/2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. Flatten slightly. Bake in preheated oven for 18 to 20 minutes. Cool on baking sheet for 2 minutes, then transfer to cooling racks. Store in an airtight container.
