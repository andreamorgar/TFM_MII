Place apples in a blender. Add milk, flour, eggs, shortening, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon and blend until well mixed, scraping down sides of blender several times. Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 minute. Repeat with remaining batter.
