Cook rice according to package directions. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. In a medium bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, salt and pepper. Stir in rice, turkey, onion and grapes until evenly coated with dressing. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. Before serving, sprinkle slivered almonds over the top of the salad.
