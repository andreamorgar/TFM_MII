Line two 9 inch round pans with parchment paper. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Measure sifted flour, baking powder, and salt; sift together three times. Cream butter or margarine and lemon rind together. Gradually add sugar, creaming until light and fluffy. Add egg yolks one at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition. Add sifted ingredients alternately with milk to the creamed mixture, a small amount at a time; beat after each addition until smooth. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on wire racks.
