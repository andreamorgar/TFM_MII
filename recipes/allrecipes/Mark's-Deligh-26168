Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg and brandy. Combine the flour and baking soda; stir into the sugar mixture. Mix in the chocolate chips and dried fruit mix. Drop dough by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets. Cookies should be about 2 inches apart. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, cookies taste best when taken from the oven while still slightly doughy. Cool on cookie sheets for a few minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
