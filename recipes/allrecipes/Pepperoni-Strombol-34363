Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Punch dough down. On a lightly floured surface, roll each loaf into 20x8 inch rectangle. Place one rectangle on a greased baking sheet. Spread spaghetti sauce in an 18x4 inch strip down the center. Sprinkle with oregano, pepperoni and mozzarella cheese. Fold long sides of dough up toward filling; set aside. Cut the remaining rectangle into three strips. Loosely braid strips; pinch ends to seal. Place bread on top of the cheese; pinch braid to dough to seal. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until golden brown.
