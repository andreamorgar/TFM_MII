Place bacon, sausage, and Canadian-style bacon in a medium skillet over medium heat. Fry until evenly brown; drain. Crumble bacon, and chop sausage. Mix eggs into the skillet, and scramble with the bacon and sausage until no longer runny. Place pita bread in a microwave, and heat on High about 30 seconds, until warm. Spoon the egg mixture into the pita bread halves, and serve warm.
