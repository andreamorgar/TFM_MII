Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Combine oats, whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, brown sugar, wheat germ, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Add banana, applesauce, egg whites, and vanilla extract; mix well. Gently fold chocolate chips and cranberries into the batter. Drop batter, about 1 tablespoon at a time, onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 12 minutes.
