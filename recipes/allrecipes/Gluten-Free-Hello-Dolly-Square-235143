Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix almond flour, milk powder, and melted butter together in an 8x8-inch baking dish. Press mixture into the bottom of the pan to form a crust. Sprinkle coconut and chocolate chips over the crust in the baking dish; pour sweetened condensed milk evenly over the top. Bake in the preheated oven until fragrant and coconut is lightly toasted, about 30 minutes.
