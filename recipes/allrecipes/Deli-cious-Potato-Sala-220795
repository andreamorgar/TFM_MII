Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, cool, and cut into chunks. Cook salami in a skillet over medium heat until heated through, about 5 minutes; drain off excess fat and allow to cool. Mix potatoes, eggs, apples, onion, and pickles in a large bowl. Stir salami, mayonnaise, red wine vinegar, salt, black pepper, and paprika into the potato mixture. Chill for at least 2 hours before serving.
