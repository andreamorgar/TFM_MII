In a saucepan, stir together the sugar and gelatin. Mix in hot coffee and water. Cook over low heat, stirring frequently until the gelatin and sugar have completely dissolved. Remove from heat, and stir in lemon juice. Pour into a 4 1/2 cup mold. Refrigerate until set, at least 6 hours or overnight. Serve with whipped cream.
