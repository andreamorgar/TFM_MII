Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Blend in butter and shortening until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Make a well in the center and add eggs, 1/4 cup of milk and vanilla. Mix until a soft dough forms. Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Roll each piece out into a long snake 1/2 inch in diameter. Cut snakes into 2 inch pieces. Dip each piece in remaining milk, then roll in sesame seeds. Place 1 inch apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.
