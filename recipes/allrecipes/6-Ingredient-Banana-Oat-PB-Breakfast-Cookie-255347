Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix bananas, oats, peanut butter, protein powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Drop tablespoonfuls of banana mixture 2 inches apart onto a nonstick baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack; let cool, about 20 minutes.
