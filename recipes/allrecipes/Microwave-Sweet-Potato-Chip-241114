Combine sweet potato slices and and olive oil in a large bowl; toss to coat. Arrange sweet potato slices in a single layer on a large microwave-safe plate; season with salt. Cook in microwave until chips are dry, crisp, and slightly browned, about 5 minutes. Cool chips on plate before transferring to a bowl. Repeat with remaining sweet potato slices.
