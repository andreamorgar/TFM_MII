Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a small bowl, mix the Parmesan cheese, chili powder, oregano, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper. Place the bagel slices on a medium cookie sheet and sprinkle with the seasoning mixture. Bake in the preheated oven 5 minutes, or until slightly crisp and lightly browned.
