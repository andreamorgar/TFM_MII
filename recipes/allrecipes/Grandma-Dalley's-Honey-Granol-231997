Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. Mix oats and almonds in a large bowl. Combine honey, butter, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan; bring to a boil for 1 minute. Pour honey mixture over oat mixture; toss to coat. Spread onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 5 minutes, until granola is lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Fold in raisins and bake for 2 more minutes. Cool and crumble.
