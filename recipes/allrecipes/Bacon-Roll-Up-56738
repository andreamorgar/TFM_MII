Preheat your oven's broiler. Open pita rounds, and spread generously with cream cheese on the inside. Replace tops, and use a pizza cutter to slice into 1 inch wide strips. Cut the long strips in half crosswise. Roll up each piece, and wrap with half of a strip of bacon. Secure with toothpicks, and place close together on a baking sheet. Broil for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the bacon is cooked through. Use a spatula to remove them to a napkin lined bowl or platter. Remove toothpicks before serving.
