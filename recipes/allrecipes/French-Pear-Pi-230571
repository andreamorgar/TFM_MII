Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Sprinkle pears with lemon juice in a bowl. Mix white sugar and nutmeg in a separate small bowl; sprinkle over pears and mix thoroughly. Fit pie crust into the bottom of a 9-inch pie dish. Cut butter, brown sugar, and flour together in a bowl using a pastry cutter until mixture resembles crumbs. Spoon pear mixture into pie shell and sprinkle top with brown sugar mixture. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until filling is bubbling and crumble topping is lightly browned, about 35 more minutes.
