Combine flour, ginger and salt and set aside. In a large bowl, cream shortening and sugar. Beat in the molasses. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients. Cover and chill for four hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 cookie sheets. On floured surface, roll out dough to 1/4 inch thickness. Using a 1-3/4 inch cutter, cut into rounds and place 1 inch apart on cookie sheets. Bake for 10-12 minutes until lightly colored and firm to the touch. Cool cookies on wire racks.
