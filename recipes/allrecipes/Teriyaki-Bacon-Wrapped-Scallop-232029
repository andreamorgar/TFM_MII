Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line 2 baking sheets with aluminum foil. Whisk teriyaki sauce, brown sugar, and ginger in a bowl. Wrap each piece of scallop with a strip of bacon and secure with a toothpick. Dip each bacon wrapped scallop in the teriyaki sauce mixture and arrange on one of the prepared baking sheets. Broil in preheated oven until lightly charred, about 6 minutes. Flip scallops and transfer to the clean baking sheet and return scallops to the oven. Continue to broil until bacon is charred on the second side, about 6 minutes more.
