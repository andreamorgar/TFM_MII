Preheat the broiler. In a medium bowl, mix sour cream, mayonnaise, Swiss cheese and dry Italian-style salad dressing mix. Spread the mixture generously on the French bread slices. Arrange slices in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Broil in the preheated oven 3 to 5 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bread is lightly browned.
