Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix chicken, red bell pepper, spinach, Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, lemon zest, salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. Set aside. Unroll crescent roll dough, and separate into 16 triangles. Arrange triangles in a circle on a 13-inch baking stone or pizza pan with the wide ends of the triangles overlapping in the center and points facing out. The center diameter should be about 5-inches. Scoop chicken mixture evenly onto the widest end of each triangle. Bring the outer point of each triangle towards the center of the circle and tuck the point under the wide end of the dough. The filling will not be completely covered. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Slice and serve.
