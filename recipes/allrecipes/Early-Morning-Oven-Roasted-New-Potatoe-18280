Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). In a hot skillet, melt the butter. Stir in rosemary, salt and pepper. Coat potatoes evenly with the melted butter. Arrange the potatoes in a single layer on a baking pan. Bake in a preheated oven until potatoes are golden brown, approximately 20 to 25 minutes. Toss them occasionally to ensure that they brown on all sides.
