In a medium saucepan over low heat, combine sugar, corn syrup, vanilla extract and water. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Heat to 250 to 265 degrees F (121 to 129 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a rigid ball. Meanwhile, beat egg whites until stiff; slowly add gelatin while beating until stiff peaks form. Continue beating and pour syrup mixture in a thin stream over the egg mixture. Beat until mixture thickens and losses its gloss. Stir in pecans. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto wax paper. Cool; store in airtight containers.
