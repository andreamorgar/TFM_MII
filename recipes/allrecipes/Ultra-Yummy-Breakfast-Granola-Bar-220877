Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with coconut oil. Stir rolled oats, almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, and coconut together onto a large baking sheet; spread the oat mixture out on a baking sheet. Toast in the preheated oven until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring after 5 minutes. Pour the oat mixture into a large bowl and mix in cinnamon. Stir raisins, turbinado sugar, agave nectar, coconut butter, peanut butter, and sea salt together in a saucepan. Place saucepan over medium-low heat, bring the mixture to a boil, and boil for 1 minute. Remove the mixture from the heat and stir in vanilla extract. Pour the hot mixture over the oat mixture and stir until the dry ingredients are moistened. Press the mixture into the prepared baking dish until even and densely packed. Refrigerate for 1 hour to set up. Turn the mixture out of the pan, cut into 16 bars, and wrap bars in waxed paper. If desired, cut bars in half to make 32 snack-size bars.
