Blend eggs, wheat berries, almond milk, oats, coconut oil, and vanilla extract together in a blender until smooth, 45 to 50 seconds. Add sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, cloves, mace, and salt; pulse blender until the dry ingredients are incorporated into the batter. Pour batter into a large bowl and fold cottage cheese into the mixture. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and coat with cooking spray. Pour about 1/4 cup batter onto the skillet and cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side, about 2 minutes more.
