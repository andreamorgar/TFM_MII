Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and butter and flour 9 (1/2-cup) muffin cups (just butter if nonstick). Beat together butter, sugar, and zest until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time. Beat in cream, then flour and salt, on low speed until just combined. Stir in 1/2 cup coconut and gently stir in blueberries. Spoon batter into cups and smooth tops. Sprinkle tops with remaining 3 tablespoons coconut. Bake in middle of oven until a tester comes out clean and edges are golden brown, about 25 minutes. Invert onto a rack and cool.
