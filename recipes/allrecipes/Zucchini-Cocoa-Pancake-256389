Combine water and flax seeds in a small bowl. Refrigerate until mixture thickens and has an egg-like consistency, 15 to 30 minutes. Stir in almond milk, banana, zucchini, and vanilla extract. Mix flour, cocoa powder, brown sugar baking blend, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and sea salt together in a bowl. Pour in flax mixture; stir until batter is just combined. Heat a large griddle over medium heat and spray with cooking spray. Drop 1/3 cup batter onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and bottoms are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a baking rack to cool. Repeat with remaining batter.
