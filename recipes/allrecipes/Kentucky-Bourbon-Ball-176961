Place the nuts in a sealable jar. Pour the bourbon over the nuts. Seal and allow to soak overnight. Mix the butter and sugar; fold in the soaked nuts. Form into 3/4" balls and refrigerate overnight. Line a tray with waxed paper. Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler over just-barely simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Roll the balls in the melted chocolate to coat; arrange on the prepared tray. Store in refrigerator until serving.
