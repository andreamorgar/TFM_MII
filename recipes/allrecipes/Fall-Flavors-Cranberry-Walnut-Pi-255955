Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine corn syrup, eggs, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl; beat well. Stir in cranberries until just combined. Pour into the prepared pie shell; scatter walnuts on top. Bake in the preheated oven until center is set and pie shell is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
