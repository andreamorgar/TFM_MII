Dissolve gelatin in boiling water. Chill until mixture starts to congeal. In a separate bowl (after gelatin has started to thicken and congeal) mix milk, lime juice, food coloring and grated lime rind until well blended. Stir in sour cream; then fold in thickened gelatin. Pour into pastry shell. Chill until firm. Garnish with whipped topping or whipped cream and lime slices.
