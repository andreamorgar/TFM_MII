In a skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Stir in the soup, mushrooms, onion, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper. Remove from the heat. On a floured surface, roll dough into a 16-in. x 8-in. rectangle. Cut into eight squares. Place about 1/3 cup meat mixture in the center of each square; sprinkle with cheese. Bring the four corners to center over filling; pinch seams together to seal. Place seam side down on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 15-20 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.
