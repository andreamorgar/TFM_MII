Beat egg whites until white peaks form. In a second bowl, beat together egg yolks and sugar. Mix in peanut butter, vanilla, honey, and milk. Fold in the egg whites. Evenly distribute the peanut butter chips on the bottom of the graham cracker crust. Pour filling into the crust, and sprinkle the chopped peanuts on the top. Bake at 350 degree F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 35 minutes.
