Heat a large skillet over medium heat and coat with cooking spray. Arrange plantain slices in a single layer. Season with half of the cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Cook until golden brown on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn over the plantain slices and pour in the pineapple and a small amount of the juice. Sprinkle the remaining spices over the top and continue to cook until browned on the bottom, about another 3 minutes.
