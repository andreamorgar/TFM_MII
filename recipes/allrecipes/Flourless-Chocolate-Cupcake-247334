Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with cupcake liners. Place oats, cocoa powder, and peanuts in a blender; blend to mix. Pour into a large bowl. Combine coffee, eggs, banana, honey, maple syrup, and vanilla extract in the blender; puree until smooth. Pour over oat mixture and beat to combine batter. Add baking soda and baking powder; mix until just combined. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes.
