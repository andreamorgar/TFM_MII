In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut in butter by rubbing the mixture between your fingers until the mixture is fine and crumbly; stir in the raisins. In a small bowl, mix together the egg and milk; mix with dry ingredients to form a soft dough. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch in thickness. Dip cutter into flour, and stamp out scones. You may need to re roll the dough to get 12. Heat dry non-stick griddle over medium heat. Cook each side of the scone until slightly raised and golden brown in color. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
