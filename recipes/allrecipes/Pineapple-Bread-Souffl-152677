Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 6x10 inch baking dish. Cream the butter and sugar together in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Stir in the bread cubes and pineapple until well blended. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle brown sugar evenly over the top. Bake in preheated oven until bread points on top are golden brown, 45 to 60 minutes. Cool before serving.
