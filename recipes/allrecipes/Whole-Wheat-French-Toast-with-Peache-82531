In a saucepan, stir together the brown sugar, butter, and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Pour the brown sugar mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish, and tilt the dish to cover the entire bottom. Place peaches in a layer over the sugar coating, then top with slices of bread. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg substitute and vanilla. Slowly pour over the bread slices to coat evenly. Sprinkle cinnamon over the top. Cover, and refrigerate for 8 hours, or overnight. Remove the dish from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before baking to bring to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown. Spoon out portions to serve.
