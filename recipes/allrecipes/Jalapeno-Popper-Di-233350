Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook and stir bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Stir bacon, cream cheese, mayonnaise, Cheddar cheese, mozzarella cheese, green onion, and jalapeno peppers together in a bowl; spread into a 9-inch round baking dish. Mix crackers, Parmesan cheese, and butter together in a bowl; spread over the top of the cream cheese mixture. Bake in preheated oven until bubbly, 20 to 30 minutes.
