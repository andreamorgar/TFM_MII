Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter and flour a 9 inch springform pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and 1 1/2 cup sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milk. Fold in cranberries and hazelnuts. Pour batter into prepared pan. Mix together 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon; sprinkle over cake, and swirl through the batter. Bake in the preheated oven for 75 to 80 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
