Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Grease cookies sheets. In a large bowl, beat egg whites until frothy. Add sugar and beat until mixture is thick and white. Stir in chopped almonds and chopped hazelnuts. Pour mixture into saucepan over low heat, stirring with a wooden spoon until thick and beige, about 10 minutes. Drop dough by teaspoonfuls onto cookie sheets about 1 inch apart. Bake about 20 minutes, until cookies are dry to the touch. Let cool on wire rack.
