Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a small bowl mix cracker crumbs, flour and baking powder. In a large mixing bowl, beat condensed milk and margarine until smooth. Add cracker crumb mixture and blend well. Stir in coconut, chocolate chips, and pecans. Drop by rounded teaspoon on a cookie sheet sprayed with non-stick spray. Bake 9-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Store loosely covered at room temperature.
