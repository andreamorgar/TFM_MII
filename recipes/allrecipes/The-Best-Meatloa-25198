Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 inch loaf pan. In a mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, salt, egg, black pepper and bread crumbs. Pour in the milk, 3 tablespoons of the steak sauce, onion and green bell pepper. Place the mixture into the prepared loaf pan and shape into a loaf. Brush the top with the remaining steak sauce. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour or until done. Allow to stand 5 minutes before slicing.
