Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Whisk olive oil, hot sauce, cumin, thyme, paprika, seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper together in a large bowl. Add sweet potatoes and toss until evenly coated. Transfer coated fries to a stoneware sheet or baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes; flip fries and continue cooking until lightly browned, 8 to 15 minutes more.
