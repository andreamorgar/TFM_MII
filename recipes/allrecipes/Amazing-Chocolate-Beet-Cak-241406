Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease three 8x4x2-inch bread pans. Blend beets and reserved liquid in a blender until smooth. Beat pureed beets, sugar, eggs, olive oil, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl until smooth. Mix flour cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl; add to the beet mixture and stir into a smooth batter. Fold chocolate chips into the batter. Pour batter into prepared bread pans to about 3/4-full. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes.
