Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brown ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside in a bowl. Cook and stir onion and green bell pepper in the same skillet until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir onion, green pepper, and spaghetti sauce into ground beef. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl. Let pasta cool slightly and stir beaten eggs and Parmesan cheese into spaghetti. Spread spaghetti mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread ricotta cheese over pasta mixture in an even layer; top with ground beef mixture. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese evenly over the top of the casserole. Bake in the preheated oven until the casserole is set in the center and the cheese topping is melted and lightly browned, about 35 minutes.
