Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Pour in milk; mix thoroughly. Pour in warm water gradually, kneading dough until soft but not sticky. Cover with plastic wrap and let dough rest, about 15 minutes. Pinch off egg-shaped balls of dough and place on a flat work surface. Roll out into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Make a small hole in the center of each round. Melt shortening in a deep fryer or large saucepan. Working in batches, fry dough rounds in hot shortening until bubbly and golden, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
