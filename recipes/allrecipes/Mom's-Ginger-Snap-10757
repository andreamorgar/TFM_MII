Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix together the brown sugar, oil, molasses, and egg. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, cloves, cinnamon, and ginger; stir into the molasses mixture. Roll dough into 1 1/4 inch balls. Roll each ball in white sugar before placing 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in preheated oven, or until center is firm. Cool on wire racks.
