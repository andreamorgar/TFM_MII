Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking, and continuously stirring until the milk has thickened and turned a caramel color, about 1 hour or more. Stir in baking soda. Continue cooking until the caramelized milk has reached a pudding consistency. Pour manjar into a bowl and cool completely in the refrigerator.
