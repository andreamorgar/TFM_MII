Blend strawberries and raspberries together in a blender until smooth; pour into a tall glass. Muddle 2 lime wedges and mint together in a separate glass or bowl until broken down; transfer to berry mixture. Add ice cubes and rum to glass. Squeeze the remaining 2 lime wedges over ice, pour in simple syrup, and top with club soda. Stir well.
