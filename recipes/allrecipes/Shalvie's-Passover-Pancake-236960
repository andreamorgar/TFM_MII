Stir matzo meal, milk, ground almonds, chocolate chips, eggs, vanilla sugar, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until the edges start to dry and are browned dry, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.
