In a medium bowl, beat together the eggs, milk, maple syrup, vanilla, and cinnamon. Take a small handful of cornflakes and crumble them into the mixture. Stir well. Soak the bread slices in the mixture for about 2 to 3 minutes. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Place the bread slices in the pan; brown on both sides. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar; serve hot.
