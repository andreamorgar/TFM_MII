Slice lemons as thin as possible, leaving on the rind. Combine with sugar; mix well. Let stand at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Beat the eggs well, and add to lemon mixture; mix well. Place in a 9-inch pie shell, arranging the lemon slices evenly. Cover with top crust. Cut slits near center. Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 12 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake for about 20 minute more, or until knife inserted comes out clean. Cool before serving.
