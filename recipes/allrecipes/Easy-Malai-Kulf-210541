Stir the milk, condensed milk, and dry milk powder together in a heavy-bottomed pan and bring to a boil. Add the sugar, cardamom, and saffron to the boiling milk; reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature; fold the pistachio nuts into the mixture. Pour the mixture into popsicle molds and freeze until solid, about 1 hour
