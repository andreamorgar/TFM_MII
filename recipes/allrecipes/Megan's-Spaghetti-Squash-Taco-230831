Make 1-inch deep punctures all over squash with a serrated knife. Microwave squash on high for 6 to 8 minutes; turn over and microwave until squash is steaming and cooked through, another 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes, cut in half lengthwise, take out seeds, and shred the flesh with a fork. Mix fresh lime juice, chili powder, ground coriander, ground cumin, and coarse salt in a large bowl. Add shredded spaghetti squash; mix well. Place black beans (heat if desired), crumbled queso fresco, chopped red onion, and chopped cilantro into separate bowls. Heat corn tortillas in a skillet over medium-low heat until warmed and flexible, about 30 seconds per side. Spread each tortilla with a spoonful of black beans and squash mixture, and a sprinkling of queso fresco cheese, onion, and cilantro; top each serving with salsa.
