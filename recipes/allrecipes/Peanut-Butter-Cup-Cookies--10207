Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). In a large mixer bowl cream peanut butter, shortening, 1/3 cup sugar and the brown sugar. Add egg, milk and vanilla; beat well. Combine flour and baking soda; gradually add to creamed mixture, blending thoroughly. Shape dough into 1 1/2 inch balls; roll the balls in sugar. Place on ungreased cookie sheet; bake 10-12 minutes. Remove from oven and IMMEDIATELY place unwrapped peanut butter cup on top of each cookie, pressing down so that cookie cracks around edges. Cool slightly; remove from cookie sheet.
