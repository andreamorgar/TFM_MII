Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Combine bread crumbs, baking powder, parsley, mustard powder, pepper, and seafood seasoning; set aside. Stir together mayonnaise, butter, Worcestershire, and egg product until smooth. Fold in crab meat, then fold in bread crumb mixture until well blended. Shape mixture into 12 crab cakes, about 3/4 inch thick, and place onto prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, then turn the crab cakes over, and bake an additional 10 to 15 minutes, until nicely browned.
