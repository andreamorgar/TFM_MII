Combine brine ingredients - water, beer, 1/8 cup salt, garlic powder, and onion powder - in a large container, one that is large enough to hold the brine and the chicken. Soak whole chicken in brine for 1 hour. Soak wood chips in water for 1 hour. Preheat grill for indirect cooking method. Place wood chips over coals when ready to cook. In a small bowl, combine cumin, curry, chili powder, pepper, 1 teaspoon salt, paprika, and cayenne pepper. Rub chicken inside and out with spice mixture. Place chicken on grill, breast side down. Close lid, and cook for 30 minutes. Turn over, and cook for an additional 25 minutes, or until juices run clear and temperature is 185 degrees in the thickest part of the chicken. Keep the lid closed while cooking for even cooking, and to get more of that smoky flavor.
