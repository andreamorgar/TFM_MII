Place potatoes in a saucepan covered by lightly salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium, and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and allow to cool, then cut into 1/4-inch slices. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the bacon strips in the butter until browned, 5 to 7 minutes; remove bacon and set aside. Add the potatoes to the bacon fat and cook over medium-high heat until browned, about 5 minutes. Beat the eggs with the salt and pepper. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet, and mix with the potatoes and bacon; allow to cook until eggs are set, 3 to 5 minutes, turning once.
