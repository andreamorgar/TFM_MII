Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a jelly-roll pan. Beat butter, 3/4 cup peanut butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a large bowl until creamy. Add flour, oats, vanilla extract, eggs, and salt; stir until just mixed. Spread batter into the prepared jelly-roll pan. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Cool brownies in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes. Spread 1/2 cup peanut butter on top of brownies.
