Place eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel. Place bacon in a large skillet; cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels; crumble when cool enough to handle. Remove seeds and stems from jalapenos; mince 1 pepper and slice remaining peppers into very thin strips; set aside. Cut eggs in half lengthwise; place yolks in a bowl. Mash egg yolks with a fork; stir in minced jalapeno, Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, red onion, and mustard. Place egg whites cut-side up on a serving platter. Spoon yolk mixture into egg white halves; sprinkle with crumbled bacon and paprika.
