Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook pasta at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Sprinkle chicken with Italian dressing mix and garlic powder. Pan-fry chicken in a nonstick skillet over medium heat, cooking in batches if necessary, until the juices run clear and chicken meat is no longer pink in the middle, about 10 minutes per batch. Turn chicken pieces over after about 5 minutes of cooking. Transfer chicken to a serving bowl and toss with cooked pasta. Pour Alfredo sauce over chicken and pasta, mix thoroughly, and serve.
