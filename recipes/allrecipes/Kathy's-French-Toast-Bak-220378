Spread the French bread cubes and cream cheese cubes evenly in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Whisk eggs, milk, maple syrup, and cinnamon together in a bowl; pour mixture over bread and cream cheese. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 45 minutes.
