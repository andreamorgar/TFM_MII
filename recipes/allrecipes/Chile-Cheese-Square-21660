Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a 9x13 inch baking dish, place 1/2 of the shredded Cheddar cheese. Top with green chile peppers. Top the chiles with the remaining cheese. In a blender, mix eggs with the juice from the chile peppers. Pour the egg mixture over the cheese mixture. Bake in the preheated oven 30 to 40 minutes. Cool before cutting into squares.
