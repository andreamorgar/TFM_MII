Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Saute diced leek until tender. Stir in the artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, Parmesan cheese, and mayonnaise. Transfer to an 8x8 inch baking dish. Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until bubbly and lightly browned.
