Place crackers in a resealable bag; crush into coarse crumbs. Mix cracker crumbs, potato flakes, seasoned salt, and black pepper together in a shallow bowl. Beat egg in a separate small bowl. Place flour in a third shallow bowl. Coat chicken pieces in flour, beaten egg, and cracker mixture, respectively. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry chicken strips until no longer pink in the center and coating is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
