Heat oven to 300 degrees F. To make the crust, pulse 44 of the RITZ Crackers in a food processor to make about 1 1/2 cups crumbs. In a medium bowl, blend together the crumbs, cocoa, and sugar. Mix in melted butter and peanut butter. Press mixture firmly into bottom and up sides of 9-inch pie pan. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes, then cool completely on rack. To make the filling, beat the cream cheese, peanut butter, sugar, and vanilla in a medium bowl with mixer until smooth. Stir in the peanuts. Carefully fold a total of 1 1/2 cups whipped cream into the peanut mixture in three additions, until the mixture is a uniform color and no streaks remain. Spread the filling into the cooled crust. Top with remaining whipped cream. Coarsely crush remaining 4 crackers and sprinkle over the top. Chill completely, at least 2 hours or overnight. Store covered in refrigerator.
