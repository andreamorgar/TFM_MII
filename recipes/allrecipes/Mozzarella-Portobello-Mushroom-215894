Place the mushrooms in a large resealable plastic bag with the salad dressing. Seal, and marinate for at least 15 minutes. Preheat grill for medium-high heat. Heat the pasta sauce in a saucepan over medium heat and keep warm. Oil the grill grate. Place the mushrooms on the grill, and cook for 7 to 10 minutes on each side, until lightly toasted. Preheat the oven broiler. Spread the bottom of a shallow baking dish or oven-proof plate with just enough pasta sauce to cover the bottom. Place mushrooms in the dish bottom side up, and top with the peppers and remaining pasta sauce. Place 2 slices of cheese on each mushroom, and sprinkle with oregano and basil. Broil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted. Serve hot.
