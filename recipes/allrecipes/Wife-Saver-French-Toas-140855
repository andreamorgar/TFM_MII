Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Stir the brown sugar, corn syrup, and butter together in a saucepan over medium-high heat until bubbly. Pour into the prepared baking dish, then arrange the sliced French bread evenly over the syrup. Whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla extract, flour, and salt until smooth. Pour over the French bread. Cover, and refrigerate overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir together the white sugar and ground cinnamon; sprinkle over the french toast. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 50 minutes.
