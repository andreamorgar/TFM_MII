Whisk apricot preserves, Russian-style salad dressing, and dry onion soup mix together in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken breasts, coat with the marinade, squeeze to remove excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 1 hour to overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dump chicken and marinade into a 12x9-inch baking dish. Bake in preheated oven, basting regularly, until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 45 minutes to 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
