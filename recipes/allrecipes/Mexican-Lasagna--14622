Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine beef, beans, oregano, cumin and garlic powder. Place 4 uncooked noodles in bottom of a 9x13 inch pan. Spread half of beef mixure over noodles. Top with 4 noodles. Spread with remaining mixure, and top with remaining noodles. In a medium bowl, mix water and picante sauce. Pour evenly over layers. Cover tightly with foil. Bake 1 1/2 hours in the preheated oven, or until noodles are tender. Blend sour cream and olives in a medium bowl. Spoon over lasagna, and top with Jack and Cheddar cheese. Bake uncovered until cheese melts, about 5 to 10 minutes.
