Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 10 inch deep dish pie plate. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until beef is brown. Drain off fat. Spread into prepared pie plate. Sprinkle meat with salt, black pepper, and oregano. Arrange tomato slices over meat, spread shredded cheese on top. In a small bowl, mix together baking mix, milk and eggs. Pour over cheese. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until knife inserted in center comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before serving.
