In a large bowl, mix together oil, pumpkin, sugars, pudding mixes, cinnamon, and salt. Slightly beat the eggs, and mix into the batter. Mix in flour and baking soda until just combined. Stir in nuts, if desired. Spread batter into two greased and floured 9 x 5 inch loaf pans. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 1 hour, or until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean.
