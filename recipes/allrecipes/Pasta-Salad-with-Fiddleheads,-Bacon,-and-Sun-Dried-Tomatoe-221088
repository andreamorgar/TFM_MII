Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the fusilli at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil into drained pasta; stir to coat. Bring a saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the fiddlehead ferns at a boil until tender, 3 to 5 minutes; drain. Rinse the fiddleheads in cold water to stop from further cooking; drain. Cook bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Crumble the bacon once cool enough to handle. Toss the pasta, fiddlehead ferns, crumbled bacon, and cucumber together in a large bowl. Combine sun-dried tomatoes, egg yolk, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, and garlic in a bowl. Stream about 1/3 of the vegetable oil into the mixture while whisking vigorously until the mixture begins to emulsify. Stream the remainder of the olive oil into the dressing while whisking; season with salt and pepper. Pour the dressing onto the pasta mixture; stir to coat.
