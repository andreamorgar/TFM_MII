Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and lightly grease. These cookies are really sticky. In a large bowl, mix together the corn syrup, brown sugar, egg, lemon juice, and lemon zest, with an electric mixer. Sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and cardamom, and stir into the sugar mixture. Add candied fruits and chopped nuts; mix well. Drop dough by tablespoons onto prepared cookie sheet, about 4 inches apart. Spread dough into a 3 inch circle. Bake in the preheated oven for 12 to 14 minutes, cookies should be browned and firm.
