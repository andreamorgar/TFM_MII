Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add asparagus, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 4 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 6 muffin cups with cooking spray. Whisk milk, eggs, maple syrup, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Place 1 asparagus half and about 1 teaspoon onion into each of the prepared muffin cups. Pour about 1/4 cup egg mixture into each muffin cup; sprinkle each with Swiss cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until frittatas are golden and puffed, about 25 minutes. Remove promptly and let cool only a few minutes, as they will deflate, like a souffle.
