Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch pie pan. In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add sugar, baking powder, salt and vanilla continuing to beat until whites form stiff peaks. Gently fold crackers and pecans into meringue mixture. Pour into pie pan. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Cover and refrigerate overnight. When ready to serve, completely cover pie with whipped topping, then arrange strawberry slices on top.
