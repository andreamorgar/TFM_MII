Spray a large skillet with Crisco cooking spray: heat over medium-high heat until hot. Add chicken; cook 2 minutes on each side or until lightly browned. Place chicken in an 11x17-inch baking dish coated with cooking spray. Bake at 450 for 20 minutes or until cooked through. Remove chicken: cook and cut into 1/4-inch strips. In a large bowl, combine chicken, rice, green onions, and grapes and pecans, if desired. Toss well and set aside. In a small bowl, combine orange rind and next 4 ingredients; stir well. Pour over chicken mixture; toss well. Serve salad at room temperature, on lettuce-lined plates, if desired.
