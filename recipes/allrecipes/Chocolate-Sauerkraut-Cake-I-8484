Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Sift cocoa, flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt together and set aside. In a separate small bowl, combine buttermilk with sauerkraut and set aside. In a large bowl, cream butter, brown sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy. Add eggs and beat in. Add flour mixture alternately with sauerkraut mixture. Beat only until blended. Pour batter into 9x13 inch pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 45 minutes, or until toothpick inserted into cake comes out clean. Cool cake and frost with your favorite chocolate frosting.
