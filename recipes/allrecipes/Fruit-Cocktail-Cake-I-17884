Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. In a large bowl mix together flour, sugar, salt and baking soda. Pour in egg and fruit cocktail with syrup. Mix well and pour into prepared pan. Sprinkle with pecans and brown sugar. Bake in the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
