Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. In a skillet over medium heat toast the pecans with 2 tablespoons of the butter, cooking for about 5 minutes. Sprinkle 1 1/2 tablespoons of the white sugar over the top. Cream 1/2 cup of the butter with the white and brown sugar. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Mix in the flour, baking soda and salt. Stir in the pecan mixture. Drop tablespoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 10 to 12 minutes until golden brown. Let cool and devour.
