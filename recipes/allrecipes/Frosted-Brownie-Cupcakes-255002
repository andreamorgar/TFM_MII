Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin with vegetable shortening. Combine brownie mix, vegetable oil, eggs, and water together in a bowl; mix until smooth. Pour into prepared muffin tin. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 16 minutes. Cool for 30 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack; allow to cool completely, about 15 minutes. Combine white frosting and food coloring in the bowl of an electric mixer; beat until coloring is evenly distributed. Pipe frosting onto cool brownies.
