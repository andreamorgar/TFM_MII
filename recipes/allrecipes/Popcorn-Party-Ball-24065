Place popcorn in a large shallow pan or dish. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring corn syrup and brown sugar to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in gelatin until dissolved. Stir in peanuts. Pour mixture evenly over popcorn, stirring to coat. When mixture is cool enough to handle, form into 2 inch balls. Let cool on waxed paper until set.
