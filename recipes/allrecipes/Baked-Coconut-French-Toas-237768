Spray the inside of a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Arrange bread slices in a single layer in the prepared baking dish. Whisk coconut milk, egg substitute, sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until evenly combined; pour over bread. Turn bread over to coat. Cover baking dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove plastic wrap from baking dish. Turn bread slices over and sprinkle coconut over bread; let stand for 15 minutes. Bake in the preheated oven until egg is set and coconut is golden, about 30 minutes.
