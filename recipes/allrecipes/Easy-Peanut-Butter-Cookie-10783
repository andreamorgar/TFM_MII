Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, beat condensed milk, peanut butter, egg and vanilla until smooth. Add biscuit mix, and mix well. Chill at least 1 hour. Shape dough into 1 inch balls. Roll the balls in sugar. Place 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets. Flatten balls slightly with a fork. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes, or until lightly browned (DO NOT OVERBAKE). Cool. Store in a tightly covered container at room temperature.
