Combine strawberries, rhubarb, 1/2 cup honey, orange juice, cardamom, ginger, and cinnamon in a large pot over medium heat. Bring to a boil; cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until rhubarb breaks down and compote thickens to resemble a jam, about 10 minutes. Transfer compote into a bowl. Refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour. Scoop the firm layer of cream from the top of the cans of coconut milk into a bowl, leaving the liquid behind. Split vanilla beans lengthwise with the tip of a sharp knife. Scrape seeds from each pod using the flat side of your knife. Add them to the coconut cream in the bowl. Whip the coconut cream with an electric mixer medium-high speed until fluffy, about 1 minute. Continue beating, slowly drizzling in 2 tablespoons honey, until soft peaks form. Serve whipped coconut cream over chilled compote.
