Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine ground beef, onion, garlic salt, salt, and pepper in a bowl; mix well. Shape into 1 1/2-inch balls. Arrange meatballs in a glass baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are browned, about 20 minutes. Cut zucchini into noodle shapes with a spiralizer. Heat tomato sauce in a saucepan over medium heat; add meatballs. Reduce heat to low. Cook, covered, until sauce and meatballs are evenly warmed, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; keep covered. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add zucchini, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until tender but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Transfer zucchini to a serving plate; top with tomato sauce and meatballs.
