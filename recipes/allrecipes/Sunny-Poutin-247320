Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Arrange frozen French fries in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 20 minutes; keep warm. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble when cool enough to handle. Heat a large skillet over medium heat; spray with cooking spray. Crack eggs into skillet; season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium low, cover skillet loosely, and cook until egg whites are firm and yolks are still runny, about 3 minutes. Divide French fries onto 4 plates; sprinkle evenly with crumbled bacon. Drizzle each serving with hollandaise sauce, sprinkle with chives, and top with an egg.
