Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain off grease and add eggs. Cook eggs and sausage together until eggs are set. Place pizza crust on a pizza pan or baking sheet. Spread crust with ricotta cheese leaving the outer edge of the crust bare. Spread the egg and sausage mixture over the ricotta cheese. Sprinkle with onion, tomato, red pepper and green pepper. Top with mozzarella. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until cheese and edges of crust are golden brown.
