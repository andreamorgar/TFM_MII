Combine the shredded cabbage and cubed chicken in a large mixing bowl; set aside. Whisk together the vinegar, ramen noodle seasoning, and sugar in a mixing bowl until the sugar has dissolved. Slowly pour the olive oil into the vinegar mixture, whisking quickly to incorporate the oil into the dressing. Stir in the green onions, then pour the dressing over the cabbage mixture. Toss the salad until evenly coated with the dressing. Sprinkle with almond slices and sesame seeds to serve.
