Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine chicken, beans, diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, diced green chile peppers, cumin, chili powder, salt, and garlic in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until filling is heated through, 5 to 10 minutes. Add Mexican cheese blend to filling and stir until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Place corn tortillas on a microwave-safe plate and cover with a wet paper towel; heat in microwave until tortillas are warmed, about 30 seconds. Spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons filling down the middle of each tortilla. Roll tortilla tightly around the filling and place, seam-side down, on a baking sheet. Spray the rolled tortillas with cooking spray. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and crispy, about 30 minutes.
