Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a medium baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place ground beef and ground pork sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and set aside. Place processed cheese food in a large, microwave safe bowl. Microwave on high 3 to 4 minutes, or until processed cheese food is melted. Into the bowl with melted processed cheese food, mix Worcestershire sauce and ketchup. When thoroughly blended, mix in beef and pork. Place approximately 2 tablespoons of the mixture on each slice of cocktail rye bread. Arrange cocktail rye bread slices in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven 10 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned and crisp.
