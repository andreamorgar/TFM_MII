Crumble the ground beef into a soup pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until browned. Drain off the grease, and season with salt to taste. Add the onion, bell pepper, and garlic; cook and stir for about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium, and season with Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, cumin and oregano. Cook and stir for another 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and stir in the chili sauce, beef broth, kidney beans and cannellini beans. Cover, and simmer for about 35 minutes. Ladle into bowls to serve, and top with shredded Cheddar cheese and jalapeno.
