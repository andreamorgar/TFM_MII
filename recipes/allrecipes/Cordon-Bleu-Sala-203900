Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the bow tie pasta and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Combine pasta, chicken, ham, Swiss cheese, and broccoli in a large bowl. Set aside. Blend honey, mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, onion, olive oil, sugar, and garlic salt in a blender. Stir in parsley. Stir dressing into the pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of dressing. Chill salad and reserved dressing in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Stir in the remaining dressing and Parmesan cheese before serving.
