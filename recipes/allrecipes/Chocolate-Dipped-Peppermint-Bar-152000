Melt the white chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, until smooth; 1 to 2 minutes (depending on your microwave). Stir in crushed peppermint candy. Spread evenly in prepared 8x8 pan; refrigerate until firm, about 10 minutes. Break the bark into bite size pieces. Melt the semisweet chocolate with the shortening in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.
