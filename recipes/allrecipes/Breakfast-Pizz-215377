Combine 1 cup flour, undissolved yeast and salt in a large bowl. Heat water and oil until very warm (120 degrees to 130 degrees F). Add to flour mixture and beat for 2 minutes. Add enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. (If using RapidRise yeast, let dough rest at this point for 10 minutes.) Roll dough to 12-inch circle; place in greased pizza pan. OR, pat dough with floured hands, pressing gently to fill greased pizza pan or baking sheet. Form a rim by pinching the edge of the dough; prick surface with fork. Bake crust in preheated 450 degrees F oven on lowest oven rack for 8 minutes. Reduce oven to 375 degrees F. Remove pizza from oven. Top pizza crust with sausage, hash browns and onions. Beat eggs, ground mustard, pepper and salt together in a bowl. Pour over toppings. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake for 16 to 20 minutes until eggs are set and crust is browned.
