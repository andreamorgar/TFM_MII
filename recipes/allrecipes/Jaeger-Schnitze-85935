Pound out cubed pork, and cut in half. Heat oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Dip pork in egg, then bread crumbs, and place in hot oil. Cook, turning, until golden brown. Remove to a warm plate. Prepare gravy mix according to package directions. Stir in mushrooms, and cook with gravy. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the egg noodles, and cook until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes; drain. Serve pork over noodles and smother with gravy.
