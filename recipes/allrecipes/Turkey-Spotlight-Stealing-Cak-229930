Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Measure 1 cup yellow cake mix and set aside. Mix remaining yellow cake mix, 1/2 cup melted butter, and 1 egg together in a bowl. Spread mixture into the prepared baking dish. Mix pumpkin puree, brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, milk, 3 eggs, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Spread pumpkin mixture over cake mix layer in the baking dish. Combine 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup butter, and reserved 1 cup yellow cake mix together in a bowl; mash with a fork until crumbly. Spread crumb mixture over pumpkin mixture layer in baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until cake is lightly browned on top and a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes.
