Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine oats, brown sugar, flour, chia seeds, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Stir applesauce and coconut oil into oat mixture until dough is evenly mixed. Fold cranberries, chocolate chips, and coconut into dough. Spoon dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes.
