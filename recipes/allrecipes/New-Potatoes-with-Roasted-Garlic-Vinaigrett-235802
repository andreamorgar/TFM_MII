Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Stir 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in a large bowl; add potatoes and garlic and toss to coat. Pour potatoes into a roasting pan. Roast potatoes in preheated oven for 35 minutes, stir, and continue roasting until tender, about 35 minutes more. Cool potatoes and garlic at room temperature for 10 minutes. Squeeze garlic cloves into a bowl to extract pulp and discard skins. Mash garlic with chives, vinegar, mustard, 1 1/2 tablespoons oil, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl; stir. Add roasted potatoes and toss to coat.
