Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Stir oats, chocolate chips, coconut, and almonds together in a large bowl. Whisk sugar, milk, butter, and salt together in a saucepan; bring mixture to a boil, add vanilla, and remove from heat. Pour milk mixture over chocolate chips mixture; stir until well-combined. Drop spoonfuls of chocolate mixture onto prepared baking sheet. Chill in the refrigerator until haystacks are set, 15 to 20 minutes.
