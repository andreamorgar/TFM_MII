Combine water, tea bags, mint leaves, and orange-flavored drink mix in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until tea is steeped, about 30 minutes. Add 2 cups cold water to tea and remove mint leaves and tea bags. Stir sugar and lemon juice into tea until sugar is dissolved; refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes. Stir vodka into tea before serving.
