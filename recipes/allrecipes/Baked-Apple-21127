Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Scoop out the core from top of the apple, leaving a well. Do not cut all the way through. Stuff each apple with 2 tablespoons brown sugar and 1 tablespoon butter. Place in a shallow baking dish and sprinkle with cinnamon. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, until sugar begins to caramelize and apples are tender.
