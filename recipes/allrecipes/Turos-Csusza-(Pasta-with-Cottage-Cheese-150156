Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain well. Cook the bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat until crisp; drain, crumble, and set aside. Place the drained noodles in a large baking dish. Stir the sour cream into the noodles. Spoon the cottage cheese evenly over the top of the noodle mixture. Sprinkle the crumbled bacon over the top; season with salt. Bake in preheated oven until the cottage cheese softens, 3 to 5 minutes.
