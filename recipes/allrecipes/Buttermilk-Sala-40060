Place the pineapple in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil. Stir in the gelatin mix until completely dissolved. Remove to a bowl, and chill until partially set, about 1 hour. Stir in buttermilk, and chill again until thickened. Fold in whipped topping, and refrigerate until firm, at least 4 hours.
