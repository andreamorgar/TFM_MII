Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 baking sheets. Combine flour, baking soda, and spices. In a large bowl, cream shortening and sugar. Beat in the egg. Beat in the corn syrup and cider vinegar. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients. On a floured surface, roll out dough to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Using a 1 1/2 inch round cookie cutter, cut dough into rounds and place 1 1/2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. Bake for 8-12 minutes--until firm to the touch. Transfer to wire racks to cool.
