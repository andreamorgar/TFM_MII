Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Cover the bottom of an 8x8-inch square pan with mango slices; sprinkle with 1/2 cup sugar. Combine butter and remaining sugar in a bowl; cream together with a fork until smooth. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, until combined. Stir in vanilla extract. Sift flour and baking powder together in a bowl. Pour flour mixture into butter mixture; stir until combined. Stir in milk slowly until smooth; spoon milk mixture over mangos. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
