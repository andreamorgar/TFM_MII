Place milk and chocolate in a 12-ounce microwave-safe mug or a 2-cup glass measuring cup. Microwave on High until hot but not boiling, 60 to 90 seconds. Stir to melt chocolate. Stir cornstarch, sugar, and salt together in a small bowl; blend into the milk mixture. Microwave on High for 30 seconds, stir, and continue to heat until mixture thickens and just begins to boil, about 15 seconds more.
