In a large bowl, mix the potatoes, green onions, corned beef, and egg. Season with salt and pepper. Form the mixture into golf ball sized balls. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place the potato balls a few at a time into the skillet, flatten with a spatula, and fry 7 minutes on each side, until crisp and golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
