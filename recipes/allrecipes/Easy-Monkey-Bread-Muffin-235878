Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with paper liners. Mix white sugar and cinnamon together in a gallon-size resealable bag; add biscuits and toss to coat. Press coated biscuits into muffin cups, about 2/3 full. Heat brown sugar and margarine together in a saucepan over medium-low heat until melted, 3 to 5 minutes; pour over each biscuit muffin. Bake in the preheated oven until dough is cooked through, about 20 minutes.
