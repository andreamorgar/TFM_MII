Beat confectioners' sugar, butter, and egg yolks together in a large bowl with an electric mixture until creamy. Fold whipped topping into the mixture. Spread 1/2 the angel food cake pieces on the bottom of a trifle dish. Pour 1/2 the whipped topping mixture in an even layer over the cake pieces. Sprinkle 1/2 the crushed candy bars over the top. Repeat layers with remaining cake, whipped topping mixture, and crushed candy. Cover dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.
