Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a shallow baking dish with cooking spray. Place the plums, cut-side up, in a single layer in the baking dish. Whisk together the orange juice, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, cumin, and cardamom in a bowl; drizzle over the plums. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until plums are hot and the sauce is bubbly. Top with toasted almonds, if desired (see Cook's Note).
