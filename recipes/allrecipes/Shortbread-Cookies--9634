Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a large bowl, cream the butter, and sugar. Mix well. In a separate bowl, beat eggs and add to the butter mixture. Stir in the caraway seeds and flour. Mix well. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into 1 inch squares (or other shapes) and place at least 1 inch apart on cookie sheets. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes...watch closely...until lightly colored. Cool on wire racks.
