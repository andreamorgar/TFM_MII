Liberally spray a medium saucepan with cooking spray. Repeat spraying while cooking as needed. Over medium heat, cook the garlic approximately 3 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms, and season with garlic salt. Cook until mushrooms are tender, about 3 minutes, and set aside. In the same saucepan, scramble eggs. Stir in the mushrooms, and continue to scramble until eggs are firm. Transfer 1/4 of the egg mixture into each tortilla. Top each with 1/2 cup cheese, 4 cherry tomatoes and 1/4 of the sprouts. Roll tortillas, and serve.
