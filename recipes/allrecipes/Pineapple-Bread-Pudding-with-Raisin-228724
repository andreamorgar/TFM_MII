Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish. Beat eggs and sugar in a large bowl until sugar is dissolved. Stir in pineapple, butter, raisins, and walnuts; stir in bread until well coated. Pour mixture into prepared baking dish and sprinkle with brown sugar. Bake in preheated oven until bread is fluffy, about 40 minutes.
