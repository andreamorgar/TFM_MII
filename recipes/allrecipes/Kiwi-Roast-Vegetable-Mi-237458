Preheat an oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Mix roasting potatoes, sweet potato, brown onion, mushrooms, parsnip, and carrots in a large bowl. Whisk olive oil, vinegar, rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl; drizzle over the vegetable mixture and toss to coat. Spread vegetables into a large roasting pan. Roast in preheated oven, turning every 10 minutes, until the vegetables are completely tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Season again with salt and pepper as desired.
