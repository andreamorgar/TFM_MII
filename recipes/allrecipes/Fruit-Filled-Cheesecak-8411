Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, combine flour, oats, baking powder, brown sugar and butter. Press all but 3/4 cup of the crumb mixture into the bottom of a 10 inch round baking pan. Spread the fruit pie filling over the top and sprinkle with the remaining crumbs. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 15 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes. In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar together. Add the vanilla and sour cream and beat until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Pour batter into the prepared crust. Place the pan in a large roasting pan and place in the oven. Fill the roasting pan with water to the 1 inch mark. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 55 minutes. Remove cake from oven, cool to room temperature and refrigerate overnight.
