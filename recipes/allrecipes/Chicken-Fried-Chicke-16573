Place crackers in a large resealable plastic bag; seal bag and crush crackers with a rolling pin until they are coarse crumbs. Add the flour, potato flakes, seasoned salt, and pepper and mix well. Beat egg in a shallow dish or bowl. One by one, dredge chicken pieces in egg, then place in bag with crumb mixture. Seal bag and shake to coat. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry chicken, turning frequently, until golden brown and juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes.
