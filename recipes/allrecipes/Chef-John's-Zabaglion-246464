Gently stir the strawberries and sugar together in a bowl. Cover and let sit at room temperature until juices release, about 1 hour. Divide fruit between 2 small, clear serving bowls or stemmed cocktail glasses. Place egg yolks, sugar, and marsala into metal mixing bowl. Set over burner on low heat. Hold rim of bowl with a potholder. Whisk until mixture forms loose peaks, 7 or 8 minutes. Mixture should feel warm to the touch. Spoon custard over the strawberries. Serve while custard is still warm.
