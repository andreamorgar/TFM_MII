Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2 quart baking dish. Arrange the peaches, apple, pear, blueberries, cherries, and plums in the prepared baking dish. In a medium bowl, beat egg, sugar, and milk. In a separate bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into the egg mixture. Stir in vanilla and melted butter. Cover the fruit with the batter mixture. Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Cobbler should be bubbly and lightly browned. Serve warm.
