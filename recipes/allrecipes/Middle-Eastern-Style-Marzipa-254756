Place almonds in a large skillet over low heat. Toast, stirring occasionally, until shells crack open easily, about 30 minutes. Cool until easily handled, about 15 minutes. Shell almonds; place in a food processor. Add cardamom, cinnamon, and salt. Process, slowly pouring in honey, until marzipan mixture lumps together. Cut and form marzipan into desired shapes. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.
