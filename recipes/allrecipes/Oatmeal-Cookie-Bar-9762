Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Grease a 9x13 inch pan. To make Filling: In a saucepan over low heat, combine dates, water, white sugar, and lemon juice. Heat for about 8 minutes, or until thick. Set aside to let cool. To make Pastry: In a large bowl, combine flour, brown sugar, oats and salt. Mix until well blended. Add in shortening until mixture forms into coarse crumbs. Press half of pastry mix into pan. Cover with date mixture and spread remaining pastry mix over the top. Bake 20 to 25 minutes until golden brown. Let cool on wire rack before cutting.
