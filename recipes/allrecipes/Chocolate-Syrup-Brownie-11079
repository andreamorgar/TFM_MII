Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup sugar, eggs, chocolate syrup, vanilla, flour and 1/2 cup nuts in a mixing bowl; beat well. Spread batter in a 15 x 12 inch pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes. Combine remaining 1/4 cup butter and 1 1/2 cups sugar in heavy saucepan. Add milk, and boil for 30 seconds. Remove pan from heat. Stir in chocolate chips, and beat until thickened. Frost brownies while still warm. Sprinkle with remaining nuts. Cool.
