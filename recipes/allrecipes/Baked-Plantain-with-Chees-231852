Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place plantains on the prepared baking sheet; brush plantains with butter. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Turn plantains and bake on other side until golden brown, about 15 more minutes. Remove plantains from oven and make a horizontal slit down the middle of each; stuff with mozzarella cheese slices. Bake until cheese melts, 2 to 3 minutes.
