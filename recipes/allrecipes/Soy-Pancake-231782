Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Whisk eggs, yogurt, soy flour, sugar substitute, olive oil, flaxseed, vanilla, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl until smooth. Ladle batter onto griddle by 1/4 cupful; spread lightly with the back of the ladle. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip carefully and cook until browned on the other side, another 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
