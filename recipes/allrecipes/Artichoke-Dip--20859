Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, thoroughly mix the mayonnaise, Parmesan, artichoke, mozzarella and garlic powder. Transfer the mixture to an 8x8 inch baking dish. Bake 30 minutes, or until the surface is lightly browned and bubbly. Sprinkle with paprika and serve warm.
