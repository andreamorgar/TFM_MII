Soak almonds in water overnight. Soak raisins in boiling water for 5 minutes then drain. Dice raisins and strawberries. Coarsely grind the soaked almonds. Add them to the diced strawberry-raisin mixture and mix well. Drop batter by spoonfuls onto a dehydrator plastic tray. Dehydrate for 24 hours or until dry at 105 degrees F (40 degrees C). Turn cookies over in 8 to 12 hours or when you see that one side is dry enough.
