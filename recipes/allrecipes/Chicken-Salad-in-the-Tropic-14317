To prepare the dressing, whisk together in a small bowl the orange juice, pineapple juice, parsley, lime juice, soy sauce, olive oil, sesame oil, honey and pepper. Prepare the salad in a large bowl by tossing the mixed greens with the dressing. Divide dressed greens on four different plates. Arrange chicken in the middle of the plate. Arrange papaya (or mango), pineapple, avocado, bell, pepper, avocado, black beans, and cheese in "triangles" surrounding chicken.
