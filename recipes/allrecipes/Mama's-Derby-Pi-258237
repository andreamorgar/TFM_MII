Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Press crust into a 9-inch pie plate to form a shell. Mix sugar, butter, flour, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl until well blended. Fold in chocolate chips and pecans. Pour into the pie shell. Bake pie in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool until center is firm before slicing, about 30 minutes.
