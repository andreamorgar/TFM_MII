Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Season potatoes with salt and pepper and spread in the baking pan. Roast potatoes in the preheated oven until easily pierced with a fork, 25 to 35 minutes. Let cool, 10 to 15 minutes. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels; crumble into smaller pieces. Combine 3/4 cup Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, onion, sour cream, mayonnaise, and most of the chives in a large bowl. Stir in potatoes and crumbled bacon. Garnish with remaining 1/4 cup Colby-Monterey Jack cheese and chives. Refrigerate salad before serving, 4 hours to overnight.
