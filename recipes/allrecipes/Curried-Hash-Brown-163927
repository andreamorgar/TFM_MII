Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the potatoes in the butter until browned, about 10 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Add the onion and cook until the potatoes are tender, another 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Stir in the cilantro, green onion, and curry powder; mix and cook another 2 to 3 minutes.
