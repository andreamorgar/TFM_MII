Butter a 9-inch square pan. Set aside. Combine milk, sugar, and butter. Heat slowly to boiling point. Stir in drained crushed pineapple and cook over medium heat to soft ball stage, 236 degrees (113 degrees C), stirring constantly to prevent burning, about 25 minutes. Cool. Stir in lemon juice. Beat until mixture is smooth and has lost its sheen. Turn into buttered pan. Let cool, then cut into squares.
