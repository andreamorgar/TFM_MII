Place the potatoes into a pot and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and cool. In a large bowl, stir together the salad dressing, pickles, eggs, hot dogs and salad dressing. Season with onion, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Stir in the cooled potatoes until coated. Cover and chill until serving.
