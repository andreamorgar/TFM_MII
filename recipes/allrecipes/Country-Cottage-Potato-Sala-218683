Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. When potatoes are cool enough to handle, slice about 1/4 inch thick; refrigerate until cool. Spread about 1/2 cup of mayonnaise on the bottom and up the sides of a large salad bowl. Place half the potato slices into the salad bowl in a layer. Generously season with salt and black pepper. Sprinkle half the green onions over the potatoes; layer half the cottage cheese and half of the remaining mayonnaise. Repeat layers and end with mayonnaise; spread the mayonnaise over the salad to seal in the layers. Sprinkle black pepper over the top of the salad, and cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate overnight. Toss well before serving.
