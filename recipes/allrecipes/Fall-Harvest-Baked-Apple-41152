Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place apples in a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine butter, maple syrup, cinnamon, ginger, lemon juice and vanilla. Bring to a boil, and drizzle equally over apples. Cover with foil, and bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove cover, and continue to bake for 10 minutes, or until apples are tender. Serve warm.
