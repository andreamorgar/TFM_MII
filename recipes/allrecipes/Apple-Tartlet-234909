Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut puff pastry into 12 equally-sized squares and arrange on a baking sheet. Dip apple slices in lemonade and place diagonally onto each puff pastry square; top each with 1 pat butter. Sprinkle superfine sugar over each square. Bake in the preheated oven until tartlet edges are golden, about 12 minutes. Bring apricot jam to boil a saucepan; cook and stir until jam is thinned, 1 to 2 minutes. Brush jam onto warm tartlets; sprinkle each with sugar crystals.
