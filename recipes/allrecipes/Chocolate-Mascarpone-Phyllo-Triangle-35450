Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a medium bowl, beat together the mascarpone cheese, HERSHEY'S (R) Cocoa Powder, vanilla extract and honey. Mix in pecans. Brush top of one sheet of phyllo dough with clarified butter, and fold in half lengthwise. Place two heaping tablespoons of the mascarpone cheese mixture in one corner of the folded phyllo sheet. Fold sheet over the filling, forming a triangle. Trim ragged edges. Repeat with remaining phyllo sheets. Place triangles seam side down on a medium baking sheet, brush with remaining butter, and bake in the preheated oven 20 minutes, or until golden brown.
