Stir the milk, condensed milk, vanilla extract, butter, and brown sugar together in a saucepan over medium heat until brown sugar has dissolved. Beat with a whisk occasionally as it warms. Just before the mixture begins to boil, remove from heat and whisk until frothy. Pour into a mug, and top with whipped cream to serve.
