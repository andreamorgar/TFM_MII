Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease one 8-inch pie pan. Beat the egg whites, salt, and cream of tartar together until foamy. Gradually beat in the sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of the vanilla. Beat on high speed until stiff and glossy. Fold in the chopped pecans. Spoon meringue into the prepared pan, forming a slight nest. Bake at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for 50 to 55 minutes. Let cool completely. While the crust is baking, melt the German chocolate with the water. Let cool until thickened. Stir in the remaining 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Whip the whipping cream and fold into the cooled chocolate mixture. Pile into the cooled pie shell and chill.
