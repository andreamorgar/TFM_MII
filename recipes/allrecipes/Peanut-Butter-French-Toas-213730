Whisk together milk, eggs, peanut butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Heat the oil in a griddle or frying pan over medium heat. Dunk each slice of bread in egg mixture, soaking both sides. Place in pan, and cook on both sides until golden, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Serve hot.
