Combine water, milk, and raisins in a saucepan. Boil. Slowly stir in oats, honey (to taste), and cinnamon. Turn down heat and cook for about 10 minutes. When oatmeal is a lot less sticky, pour into bowl. Spray cookie sheet with cooking spray. Take small handfuls of the oatmeal (this is very messy) and kneed into balls. Place on cookie sheet. Poke small holes in each ball and fill with honey. Close with extra oatmeal. Place cookie sheet in oven and bake for about 10 - 15 minutes at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
