Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 9-inch pie plate with pastry. Mix the sugar, flour, and salt; toss with the cherries, mixing well. Pour the cherry filling into the pie shell, and dot with butter. Weave strips of pastry into a lattice top. Place the pie on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden brown, about 40 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
