Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and stir in the garlic. Season chops with salt and black pepper. Pan fry until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Place the chops into the prepared baking dish, and scatter the onions over the chops. Pour water into the skillet, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Scrape up and dissolve all the juices and browned flavor bits from the skillet into the water. Pour the mixture over the pork chops. Spread creamed corn evenly over the pork chops. Bake the pork chops in the preheated oven until the pork is tender and no longer pink in the middle, about 45 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
