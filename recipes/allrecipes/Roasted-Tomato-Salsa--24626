Preheat the broiler. In a medium baking dish, place roma (plum) tomatoes, garlic, onion and jalapeno chile pepper. Drizzle with olive oil. Checking often, broil 5 to 10 minutes, or until outsides of vegetables are charred. Remove vegetables from heat. Remove and discard tomato cores, jalapeno stem and garlic skins. In a food processor, coarsely chop the charred vegetables. Transfer to a medium bowl and mix in cumin, salt, lime juice and cilantro.
