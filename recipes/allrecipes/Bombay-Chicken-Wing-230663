Combine chicken wings, vegetable oil, soy sauce, green onion, garlic, curry powder, turmeric, and black pepper in a resealable plastic bag. Squeeze out the air, seal bag, and refrigerate at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread chicken wings into a large baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until wings are browned, about 25 minutes.
