Mix together flour, sugar, baking powder and cheese. In a separate bowl, beat together egg, milk and oil. Stir egg mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.
