Combine 2 cups cranberry-raspberry juice drink, 1 1/4 cups sugar, 1/2 cup Campari and orange peel strips in heavy large saucepan. Bring to boil, stirring until sugar dissolves. Cover and reduce heat to very low, keeping poaching liquid hot. Peel pears, leaving stems attached. Rub pears all over with cut lemon halves. Using melon baller, remove cores through wide end of pears, then cut thin slice off wide ends so that pears can stand upright. Add pears to poaching liquid. Simmer uncovered over medium-low heat until pears are tender, turning occasionally, about 20 minutes. Cool pears in poaching liquid. Refrigerate until cold, at least 6 hours. Puree raspberries with their syrup, 2 tablespoons orange liqueur and currant jelly in blender. Strain raspberry sauce through fine sieve. Chill until cold, about 1 hour. (Pears and raspberry sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover separately and keep refrigerated.) Whisk mascarpone, 2 tablespoons powdered sugar and remaining 2 tablespoons orange liqueur in bowl to blend. Spoon some raspberry sauce onto plates. Stand pears upright in center of sauce. Spoon dollops of mascarpone mixture alongside. Garnish with mint leaves and serve.
