Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Season salmon fillets with salt. Place salmon on the preheated grill; cook salmon for 6 to 8 minutes per side, or until the fish flakes easily with a fork. Combine water, rice vinegar, brown sugar, chile paste, ginger, garlic, and soy sauce in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium and simmer until barely thickened, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle basil on top of salmon; spoon glaze over basil.
