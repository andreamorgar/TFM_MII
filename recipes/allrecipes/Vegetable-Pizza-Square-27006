Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Unroll crescent roll dough on a small baking sheet. Arrange into a single layer to serve as a crust. Bake in the preheated oven 10 minutes, or until puffed and lightly browned. In a medium bowl, mix cream cheese, mayonnaise, dill weed, onion and garlic. Spread the cream cheese mixture over the crescent roll dough crust. Layer with cauliflower, broccoli and green peppers. Top with Cheddar cheese. Chill in the refrigerator until serving.
