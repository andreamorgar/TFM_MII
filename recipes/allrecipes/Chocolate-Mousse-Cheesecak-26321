In the top of a double boiler, heat chocolate, stirring occasionally, until chocolate is melted and smooth. Remove from heat and allow to cool to lukewarm. In a small bowl, sprinkle gelatin over cold water; let set 5 minutes. Place the bowl over hot water in the pan and stir until gelatin dissolves; set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the cream cheese and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in rum, egg yolks and dissolved gelatin. Beat in the melted chocolate. Fold in whipped cream. In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the batter, then quickly fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain. Pour mousse into pie crust. Refrigerate at least 4 hours before serving.
