In a saucepan, combine water and sugar. Bring to a boil and let boil for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Stir in the orange juice concentrate, lemonade concentrate and gin. Pour into a plastic container and freeze overnight. To serve, scoop 1/2 cup slush into a glass and top with lemon-lime soda.
