Whisk together eggs, milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and ginger in a bowl until smooth. Stir in the baking mix until moistened, then add the bananas and chocolate chips, and stir to mix. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Flip over once bubbles appear on the top. Cook until browned on the other side. Serve hot.
