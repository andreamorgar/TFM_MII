Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 10 muffin cups or line with paper liners. Drain blueberries from muffin mix. Mix muffin mix, water, oil, and eggs together in a bowl until batter is just mixed; fold in blueberries. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each to the top. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 16 to 21 minutes. Cool until able to be handled and cut tops off each cupcake, reserving tops for a separate use. Spread cream cheese frosting, starting from the middle and working outwards, onto each cupcake bottom. Arrange fruit roll strips onto each, forming "stripes" and place 2 blueberry halves in the left corner of each for the "stars".
