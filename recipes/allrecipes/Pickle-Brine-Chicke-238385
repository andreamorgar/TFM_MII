Whisk pickle juice, brown sugar, kosher salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper, and 1 pinch cayenne pepper together in a large bowl until sugar dissolves. Submerge chicken breasts in brine, using a plate or bowl to sink the breasts into the brine; refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken breasts from brine, discard the brine, and dry chicken breasts with paper towels. Brush each breast with olive oil and season each with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to a plate, tent the plate with aluminum foil, and let chicken rest for 5 minutes.
