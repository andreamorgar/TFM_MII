Thoroughly mix together the softened cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, and onion soup mix in a bowl. Chill in refrigerator for about 1/2 hour to firm up, if necessary. Form the mixture into a ball or log, and press the outside with walnuts. Serve on an appetizer tray or a decorative plate surrounded by assorted crackers.
