Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the potatoes in the heated oil until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the onion and garlic; continue cooking until the onions sweat and begin to caramelize. Season with chipotle chile powder, cumin, coriander, salt, and pepper; stir. Transfer to a bowl and cover with a plate to retain the heat. Pour 2 tablespoons olive oil into the skillet and return to medium heat. Crack the eggs into the heated oil and cook until they begin to turn opaque; flip and continue cooking until no clear white remains. (Don't overcook the eggs -- the best part of this meal is the smoothness that the yolk adds to the mix). Place the cooked eggs atop the potato mixture. Top with cilantro, feta cheese, and avocado to serve.
