In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt together the peanut butter and honey, stirring frequently until warm and creamy. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. In a large bowl, toss together the granola, rice cereal, pecans, chocolate and butterscotch chips and graham cracker crumbs. Stir in the peanut butter mixture. Shape into balls of desired size and refrigerate until serving.
