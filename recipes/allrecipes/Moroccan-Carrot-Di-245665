Put carrots, garlic, ginger, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large saucepan. Add 2 cups water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, until carrots are tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain. Transfer carrot mixture to a food processor along with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, apricot preserves, lemon juice, sesame oil, coriander, and cayenne. Process until almost smooth.
