Grease an 8x8-inch baking dish with butter. Beat cream cheese in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract until smooth. Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave). Beat chocolate into cream cheese mixture until smooth. Stir in pecans. Pour chocolate mixture into prepared baking dish. Chill until set.
