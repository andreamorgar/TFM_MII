Cut the pork roast into thirds, and place in a pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 1 hour, or until pork reaches an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Drain, cool, and shred. Place the shredded pork in a bowl, and season with garlic salt, salt, and pepper. Mix in the Cheddar cheese and onion. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place equal amounts of the pork mixture in the center of each corn tortilla, and fold in half to form tacos. One or two at a time, cook the tacos in the hot oil until golden brown.
