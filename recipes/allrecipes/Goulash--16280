Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. In a large skillet, over medium heat, brown the ground beef and onion together. Drain off the grease. Add salt, pepper, and garlic salt to taste. Stir in the corn, kidney beans, and tomato soup. Stir in the cooked egg noodles and mix thoroughly.
