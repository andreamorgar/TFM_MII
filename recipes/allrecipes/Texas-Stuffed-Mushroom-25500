Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a medium bowl, mix together cream cheese, barbeque sauce and steak sauce. Arrange mushroom caps in the baking dish, and stuff each cap with equal portions of the cream cheese mixture. Sprinkle with bacon bits. Bake 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly browned.
