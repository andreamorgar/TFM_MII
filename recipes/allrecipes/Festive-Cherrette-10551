Blend together shortening, butter, salt, sugar, and vanilla. Add flour and pecans and mix into soft dough. Measure out level tablespoonfuls of dough and roll in palms of hands to form round balls. Place on greased baking sheets. Press a little indentation in center of each ball with a thimble and put a half of candied cherry on top of each. Bake in a 325 degree F (165 degrees C) oven for 25 minutes.
