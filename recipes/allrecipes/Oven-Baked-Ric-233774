Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Butter a 2 1/2-quart baking dish. Pour rice into the prepared baking dish. Stir water, butter, salt, and vinegar together in a saucepan; bring to a rolling boil. Pour the water mixture over the rice; stir. Bake in preheated oven until the water is absorbed and the rice tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
