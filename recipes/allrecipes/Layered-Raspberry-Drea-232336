Combine graham cracker crumbs, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl; stir in melted butter. Set aside 1/2 cup of graham cracker mixture; press remaining mixture into a 9x13-inch dish. Chill crust until firm, about 30 minutes. Beat cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a bowl until soft and fluffy. Spread cream cheese mixture over graham cracker crust and chill until firm, about 30 more minutes. Whisk raspberry gelatin and boiling water together in a separate large bowl until gelatin has dissolved; stir in lemon juice. Gently fold frozen raspberries into warm gelatin; cold raspberries will cause gelatin to begin to set. Spread raspberry mixture over cream cheese layer in pan. Spread whipped topping over raspberries and sprinkle dessert with reserved crumb topping. Chill at least 2 more hours.
