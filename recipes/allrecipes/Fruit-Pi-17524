Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix together cherries, cherry pie filling, currants, cranberries, gooseberries, apples, sugar, cinnamon, and almond extract. Allow to set 15 minutes. Spoon equal amounts of fruit mixture into 3 pastry-lined 9 inch pie pans. Dot each pie with 1 tablespoon butter. Cover each pie with top pastry. Seal edges and cut steam vents in tops. Bake in preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes, until golden brown.
