Peel the skin from the orange leaving the bitter white pith behind. Stick the cloves into the skin. Squeeze the juice from the orange and add to the 2-3/4 cups orange juice. Place all ingredients into a large nonreactive pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat, cover and allow to stand at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to blend. Serve warm or cold.
