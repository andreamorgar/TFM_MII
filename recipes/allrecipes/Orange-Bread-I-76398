Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a 5x9 inch loaf pan with aluminum foil. Lightly grease the foil. In a bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, beat together the butter, honey, egg, and orange zest until creamy. Alternately stir the flour mixture and orange juice into the butter mixture. Fold in the pecans, and transfer to the prepared loaf pan. Bake in preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 55 minutes.
