Combine tripe and lemon juice in a large bowl. Let sit, about 10 minutes. Transfer tripe and lemon juice to a large pot. Cover with 2 inches of water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, about 10 minutes. Drain and rinse tripe. Return tripe to the pot. Cover with 2 quarts beef broth, adding water as needed. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and cook until tender, about 2 hours. Stir remaining beef stock, cassava, potatoes, yams, pumpkin, sweet potatoes, tomato sauce, sofrito, and corn into the pot. Cook until tender, about 20 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.
