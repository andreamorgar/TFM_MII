Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a bowl, mix the hot red pepper sauce, margarine, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, and salt. Mix pecans into the bowl, tossing to coat evenly. Spread pecans in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake 10 minutes in the preheated oven, stirring often and watching carefully, until lightly browned. Remove from heat, and set aside. Rub chicken with the olive oil, place on a baking sheet, and sprinkle with Greek seasoning. Bake 20 minutes or until juices run clear. Slice into strips. In a salad bowl, toss together romaine lettuce, chicken strips, cherry tomato halves, strawberries, grapes, raspberries, and blueberries. Sprinkle with pecans, and drizzle with dressing.
