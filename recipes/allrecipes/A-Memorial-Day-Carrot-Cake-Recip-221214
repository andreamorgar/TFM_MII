Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Generously grease 2 9-inch round cake pans. Stir almond flour, sea salt, cinnamon, baking soda, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. Beat eggs, agave nectar, and grapeseed oil together in a separate large bowl. Stir carrots, raisins, and walnuts into the egg mixture. Stir carrot mixture into flour mixture to form a batter; pour into prepared cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
