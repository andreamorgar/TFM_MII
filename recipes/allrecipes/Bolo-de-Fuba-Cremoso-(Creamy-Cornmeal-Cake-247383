Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch cake pan. Combine milk, sugar, eggs, Parmesan cheese, and butter in a blender; blend until smooth, about 5 minutes. Add coconut, cornmeal, and flour; blend until creamy. Add baking powder and salt and blend until smooth. Pour into the prepared cake pan. Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown and edges pull away from the sides of the pan, about 30 minutes.
