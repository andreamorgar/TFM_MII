To make the custard, beat the eggs with the palm sugar, coconut cream, and pandan leaves in a bowl so the pandan aroma is imparted to the eggs. Strain the mixture and set aside. Combine the agar-agar powder and water in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until the powder is completely dissolved. Whisk the sugar into the mixture until dissolved, but do not bring to a boil. Stir the custard into the mixture allow to cook for about 2 minutes. Pour the mixture into 1-cup molds. Store in refrigerator to allow to set, about 2 hours. Remove the jellies from the molds to serve.
