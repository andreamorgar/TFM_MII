Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Combine strawberries, balsamic vinegar, sugar, and black pepper in a bowl; marinate for 10 to 15 minutes. Grill the slices of angel food cake on the preheated grill until toasted, 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Transfer the cake to 4 dessert plates and top with marinated strawberries and the liquid and a spoonful of whipped cream.
