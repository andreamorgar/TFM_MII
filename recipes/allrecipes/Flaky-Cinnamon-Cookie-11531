Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a small bowl, mix together the cinnamon and sugar. Flatten out each pastry sheet, sprinkle sugar mixture evenly over the surface. Roll up the sheet the long way, and slice into about 15 slices. Place on a cookie sheet and bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven.
