Grease a 9 x 5 inch loaf pan. Preheat oven to 350 degrees (175 degrees C). Combine oil, honey, eggs, vanilla, and mashed bananas in a bowl. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, wheat germ, salt, and baking soda. Make a well in dry ingredients, and add the banana mixture. Mix together until dry ingredients are moistened. Stir in nuts. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake 1 hour in preheated oven. Test for doneness, and cool on wire rack.
