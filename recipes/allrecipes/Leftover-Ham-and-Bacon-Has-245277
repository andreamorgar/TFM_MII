Preheat oven to 425F. In large bowl, whisk together mustard, oil, salt and pepper until combined. Add potatoes and mushrooms and toss to coat. Spread potato mixture evenly onto 2 lightly oiled or nonstick rimmed baking pans and roast in oven for 35-40 minutes or until potatoes and mushrooms have started to brown, stirring halfway through cooking. Add any leftover bacon or ham to the mixture and stir. Add in roasted peppers to oven-safe serving casserole (if desired) and top with cheese. Bake for additional 10-15 minutes or until cheese has softened and begun to melt. Top hash with eggs cooked to your preference and sliced basil.
