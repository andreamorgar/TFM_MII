In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine half-and-half and milk. Heat through, then reduce heat to low and stir in egg yolks and and cheese, a little at a time, until well incorporated. Simmer 5 to 10 minutes, until thick, stirring occasionally. Stir in salt and pepper to taste and toss with hot pasta.
