Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets. Sift flour, baking soda, and 1/8 teaspoon salt together in a bowl. Beat 1 cup butter, white sugar, and egg in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add flour mixture, vanilla extract, and lemon extract to butter mixture; stir until dough is well blended. Roll cookie dough into walnut-size balls and place 2 inches apart onto prepared cookie sheets. Press each ball down with the bottom of a glass to flatten slightly. Bake in the preheated oven until baked through, 6 to 7 minutes. Cool. Stir confectioners' sugar, 1/4 cup melted butter, hot water, and vanilla together in a bowl until sugar is completely dissolved and icing is smooth. Spread icing on cooled cookies and top each cookie with a pecan.
