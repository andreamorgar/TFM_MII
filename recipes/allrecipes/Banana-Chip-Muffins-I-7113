Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Coat a 12 cup muffin tin with nonstick spray. Whisk together flour, baking powder, soda, cinnamon, salt, and sugar. Mix in egg whites, applesauce, and banana mash until just moistened. Stir in chocolate chips. Divide batter into muffin cups. Bake for 15 to 18 minutes.
