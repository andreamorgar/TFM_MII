Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 12 muffin cups with cooking spray. Cook and stir bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to a bowl, reserving bacon grease in the skillet. Combine spinach, mushrooms, green bell pepper, onion, salt, and ground black pepper to taste in the skillet with bacon grease; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetable mixture to a bowl and place in the freezer to cool, about 5 minutes. Whisk eggs and cream together in a bowl; stir in 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. Add cooled vegetables and bacon to egg mixture and mix gently. Scoop 1/4 cup egg mixture into each muffin cup; top each with remaining Colby-Jack cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until egg cups are set, about 20 minutes.
