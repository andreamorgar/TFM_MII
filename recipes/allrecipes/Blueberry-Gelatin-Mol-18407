In a medium bowl, stir 2 cups boiling water into the raspberry gelatin until dissolved. Mix in blueberries and pineapple and pour into a 2 quart mold. Let set in refrigerator until firm (about 2 hours). In a small bowl, mix together the cream cheese, sour cream, sugar and vanilla until well blended. Spread over the set gelatin and sprinkle with chopped pecans, if desired. Refrigerate until serving.
