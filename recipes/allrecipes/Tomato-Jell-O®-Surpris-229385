Pour tomatoes into a saucepan, saving the can to use as a mold. Bring to a boil over medium heat and stir lemon gelatin and salt into tomatoes until dissolved. Mix in vinegar. Pour the mixture into the empty tomato can and refrigerate until firmly set, at least 2 hours. To serve, puncture a hole in the bottom of the can and dip can in warm water until the gelatin releases. Place onto a serving plate and cut in slices.
