Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix oats, flour, 3/4 cup brown sugar, and butter together in a bowl until crumbly. Mix apples, pears, 3/4 cup brown sugar, and cinnamon together in a separate bowl; spread into the bottom of a 9x9-inch glass pan. Sprinkle oat mixture atop apple-pear mixture; top with almonds. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, about 40 minutes.
