Put marshmallow chicks in a glass jar or bottle and top with vodka. Cover jar. Allow marshmallows to sit until colored coating is dissolved into the vodka and marshmallows are mostly dissolved, 2 to 3 days. Strain marshmallow pieces out of vodka. Pour vodka back into the bottle or another airtight container.
