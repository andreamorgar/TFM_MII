Heat the olive oil in a small skillet over medium-low heat; cook the onion and garlic in the hot oil until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir the peaches, pear, and honey into the onion and garlic mixture; allow to cook together for 2 minutes. Season with the curry powder, salt, and pepper. Continue cooking at a simmer until hot, 5 to 6 minutes.
