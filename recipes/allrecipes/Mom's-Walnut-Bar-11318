Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (100 degrees C). Combine the white sugar, ground walnuts, orange zest, orange juice and 2 egg whites. This mixture will become very sticky and paste-like. Form the paste into a long rectangle on a smooth surface sprinkled with sugar so that it won't stick. The rectangle should be about 16 x 4 inches. Make the frosting by mixing the remaining egg white with the confectioners' sugar. You don't need to beat the egg white first! You may need to add a little water, or a little more powdered sugar to form a paste that you can easily spread, but that isn't runny. Spread the frosting over your rectangle. Use a knife covered with sugar to cut the rectangle into small 1 x 2 inch bars and place them on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at 200 degrees F (100 degrees C) for about 35 minutes or until frosting is hard but still white. Enjoy with a big glass of milk!
