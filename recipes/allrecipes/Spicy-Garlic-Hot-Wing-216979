In the meantime put hot chili oil in a small saute pan. Add ginger, garlic, and green onions. Saute for 3 minutes, turn saute pan heat down to low and add in the rice vinegar, sugar, sesame oil, and cilantro. Stir well to combine. In a small bowl mix cornstarch and water, pour into sauce pan with vegetable. Stir together and heat until it thickens, about 5 minutes.
