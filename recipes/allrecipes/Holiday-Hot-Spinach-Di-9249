Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix together spinach, bell pepper, garlic, artichokes, sour cream, and parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Mixture will be thick; add cream to thin to dip consistency. Spoon into a 1-quart baking dish. Bake for 20 minutes, or until bubbly. Serve with crackers.
