Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet or wok over medium heat; cook the onions in the hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the potato, soy sauce, and water; simmer until the potatoes are nearly cooked through, about 15 minutes. Stir the chicken, tomatoes, chile pepper, peas, carrot, corn, tomato sauce, chili sauce, and eggs into the mixture; toss to combine. Cook and stir until heated through, about 10 minutes. Add the noodles and continue cooking until the noodles soften, 2 to 3 minutes more. Serve hot.
