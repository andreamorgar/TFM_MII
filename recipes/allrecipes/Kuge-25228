Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch glass baking dish. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and stir in 6 tablespoons sliced butter. In a medium bowl beat egg yolks with sugar and cream cheese; stir into noodles and add sour cream, cottage cheese and salt. Beat egg whites until stiff and fold into mixture. Transfer mixture to prepared dish. In a small bowl combine melted butter, 1/4 cup sugar, and graham cracker crumbs. Sprinkle over noodle mixture. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour.
