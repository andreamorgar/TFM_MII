Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, spray an ovenproof wire rack with cooking spray, and place rack on the prepared baking sheet. Whisk yogurt, lemon juice, and Dijon mustard together in a shallow bowl. Stir panko bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese together in another shallow dish. Gently dip 1 fillet in yogurt mixture to coat completely; press fillet into bread crumbs. Place coated fillet on the wire rack on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining fillet. Bake fillets in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 18 to 22 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).
