Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a large skillet, brown ground beef and sausage. After beef and sausage are browned, add cheese. Mix often. Once all ingredients are combined spoon 1 tablespoon of the mixture onto each piece of rye bread. Arrange bread with toppings on a baking sheet. Bake 5 to 7 minutes.
