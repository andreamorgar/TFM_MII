In a medium bowl, stir together the boiling water, unflavored gelatin, and lime flavored gelatin until gelatin is dissolved. Set aside to cool until slightly thick. Using an electric mixer, beat in the mayonnaise, cottage cheese, and horseradish until foamy. Fold in the pineapple, pecans and salt. Pour into a gelatin mold, and refrigerate until set.
