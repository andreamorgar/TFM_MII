Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Remove biscuits from cans. Flatten each biscuit slightly. Spoon a teaspoon of barbeque sauce in the center of each flattened biscuit. Sprinkle a teaspoon of cheese over barbeque sauce; top with cocktail wiener. Pull opposite sides of each biscuit together to form a taco shape. Press edges together to seal; fold over to one side, pressing biscuit down on itself. Arrange filled biscuits on 2 baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving.
