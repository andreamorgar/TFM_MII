Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8 inch baking pan. In a medium bowl, beat together sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla extract using an electric mixer until soft and creamy, at least 10 minutes. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into the butter mixture a little at a time, alternating with the maple syrup and milk. Just mix enough to moisten. Pour into the prepared pan. Bake in a preheated oven for 45 minutes. The maple syrup will sink to the bottom, and the top should be lightly browned. Serve warm.
