Place the apples, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and tapioca into a bowl, and toss to coat apple slices. Place the apple mixture into a slow cooker. Pour lemon juice and boiling water over the apples. Set the cooker to High and cook until apples are tender and thickened, 3 to 4 hours. Mix in raisins if desired; serve warm.
