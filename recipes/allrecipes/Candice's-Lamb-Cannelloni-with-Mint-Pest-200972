Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the pasta in the boiling water uncovered until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Cut each sheet in half, width-wise. Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the lamb in the hot oil until evenly browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Season with the sage, thyme, salt, and pepper. Remove from heat; stir the goat cheese into the cooked lamb. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the lamb mixture into the center of each of the lasagna sheets and roll into a cylinder; arrange on a plate. Blend the mint, pine nuts, and olive oil in a blender until finely chopped but not liquefied; drizzle over the rolls to serve.
