In a saucepan, combine the dry mustard, flour, butter, eggs, sugar, water and vinegar. Cook over medium-high heat until thick and nice and smooth, stirring often. If necessary, add up to 1 tablespoon additional flour. Set aside to cool. Blend together cooled dressing with one equal part creamy salad dressing. Pour enough dressing over cooked potatoes to coat.
