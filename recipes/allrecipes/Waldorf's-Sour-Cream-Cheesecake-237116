Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix vanilla wafers, margarine, 2 tablespoons sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl; press into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Beat the two 8-ounce packages and 3-ounce package cream cheese with 1 cup sugar and lemon juice until smooth. Beat eggs, 1 at a time, into cream cheese mixture, stirring well after each addition; spread over crust. Bake in the preheated oven until middle of cheesecake is set, 25 to 30 minutes; cool for 10 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Mix sour cream, 2 tablespoons white sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until creamy; pour over cheesecake. Bake until topping is set, about 5 minutes. Cool cheesecake to room temperature and refrigerate until serving.
