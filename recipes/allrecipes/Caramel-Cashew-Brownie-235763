Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square pan. Cook and stir caramels, butter, and milk together in a large saucepan over low heat until melted and smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and stir sugar into mixture until smooth. Whisk eggs and vanilla extract together in a bowl; stir into caramel mixture. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl; stir into caramel mixture until batter is just combined. Fold cashews into batter. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.
