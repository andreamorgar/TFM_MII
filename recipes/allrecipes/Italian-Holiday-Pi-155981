Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat the eggs, sugar, lemon zest, and vanilla together in a mixing bowl until light colored and fluffy, about 10 minutes. Pour in the milk and cream; continue beating to make a smooth mixture. Stir in the ricotta cheese and cherries until evenly blended. Pour into the pie shells. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), and bake until set, about 50 minutes more. Cool on racks. When pies are completely cool, dust with confectioners' sugar, and decorate by placing 1 whole cherry in the center of each pie.
