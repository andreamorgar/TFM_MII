Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Spray non-stick muffin pan with cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine flours, oats, baking powder and baking soda. In another bowl, whisk together bananas, eggs, sugar, applesauce, buttermilk and vanilla. Pour over dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Spoon into prepared muffin pan. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until a tester inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes. Transfer to rack to cool completely. Spread each muffin with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of NUTELLA(R).
