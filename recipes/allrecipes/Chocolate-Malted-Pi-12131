Cook pudding according to package directions, using the 3 cups of milk. Remove from heat. Add bittersweet chocolate, and stir in malted milk powder. Cool mixture for 5 minutes, stirring often, then pour into crumb crust. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours. Up to one hour before serving: beat cream and sugar with electric mixer until soft peaks form when beaters are lifted. Spread whipped cream over chocolate filling. Chop the malted milk balls into 3 or 4 pieces each, and sprinkle on top of the pie. Drizzle pie with the chocolate syrup. Refrigerate until serving time.
