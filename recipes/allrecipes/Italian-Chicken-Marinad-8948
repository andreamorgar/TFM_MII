In a shallow baking dish, mix the salad dressing, garlic powder, and salt. Place the chicken in the bowl, and turn to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator at least 4 hours. (For best results, marinate overnight.) Preheat the grill for high heat. Lightly oil grate. Discard marinade, and grill chicken 8 minutes on each side, or until juices run clear.
