In a medium bowl, blend cream cheese, sour cream and mayonnaise. In the bottom of an approximately 12 inch round serving dish, spread the cream cheese mixture. Pour cocktail sauce evenly over the mixture. Layer with green bell pepper, green onions and tomato. Top with crabmeat and shrimp. Sprinkle with mozzarella. Cover and chill in the refrigerator at least 2 hours before serving.
