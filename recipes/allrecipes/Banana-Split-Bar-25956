Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. Make a well in the center and pour in the crushed pineapple, eggs, oil, bananas and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Stir in the cherries. Mix well and pour into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Frost cake while still warm. To make the frosting: in a medium bowl, combine melted butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla and confectioners' sugar. Beat in milk, one tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is achieved.
