In a medium saucepan, stir together the flour, sugar, tapioca, vinegar, and the reserved pineapple juice. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thick. Remove from heat and chill. In a large bowl, combine the pineapple, apples, peanuts, and chilled tapioca mixture. Fold in the whipped topping and chill for at least 1 hour before serving.
