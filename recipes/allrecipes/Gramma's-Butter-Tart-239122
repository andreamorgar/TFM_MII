Whisk flour and 1 teaspoon salt together in a large bowl; cut lard into flour mixture with a pastry blender until crumbly. Make a well in the flour mixture and place 1 beaten egg into the well. Pour ice cold water and vinegar into flour mixture; stir with a wooden spoon until a dough forms. Divide dough into two balls; wrap dough in waxed paper and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat brown sugar and butter together in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth; beat in 2 eggs one at a time. Stir raisins and vanilla extract into butter mixture. Roll out one ball of dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thickness; reserve remaining dough for another use. Cut dough into circles large enough to fit into the bottom and partway up sides of the wells of a muffin tin using a round biscuit cutter. Press dough circles lightly into muffin tin to form tart shells; fill each shell 3/4 full with raisin mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until filling is bubbly and pastry is lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
