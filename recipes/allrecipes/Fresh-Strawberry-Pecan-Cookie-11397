Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease, or line baking sheets with parchment paper. Cream the sugar and shortening together in a mixing bowl. Stir in the baking soda, eggs, and strawberries until just blended. Stir in the flour, salt, and pecans, and mix well. Drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until tops set and are lightly browned, about 15 minutes.
