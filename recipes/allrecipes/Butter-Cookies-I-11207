Sift the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar together. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the egg, cream and vanilla extract. Blend thoroughly (this usually works best with your hands). Form dough into a flattened ball, wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours. This mixture can keep for several days. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Roll dough out on a floured board to about 1/4 to 1/8 inch thick. Cut out shapes with a cookie cutter and decorate with different types of sprinkles. Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 5 to 8 minutes.
