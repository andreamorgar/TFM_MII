Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Roll pie pastry onto a cutting board. Cut crust into eight 4-inch circles using a cookie cutter. Place 1 peach slice in the center of each circle. Fold circle in half to enclose each peach slice; seal edges together. Place mini pies on a baking sheet. Mix cinnamon and sugar together in a small bowl; sprinkle over mini pies. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned, 10 to 13 minutes.
