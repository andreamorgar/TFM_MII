Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Sift flour with baking soda and salt. Cream shortening, and then add sugar and pudding mix. Cream until light and fluffy. Add eggs and mix well; then add flour mixture. Mix until well-blended. Drop teaspoonfuls of dough onto greased baking sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven.
