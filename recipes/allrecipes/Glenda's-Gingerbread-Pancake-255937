Mix flour, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, and pumpkin pie spice together in a bowl. Whisk eggs in a separate bowl until smooth. Mix in milk, molasses, coconut oil, and vanilla extract. Whisk flour mixture into milk mixture until batter is combined; a few lumps are okay. Grease a griddle lightly with oil; preheat over medium-low heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
