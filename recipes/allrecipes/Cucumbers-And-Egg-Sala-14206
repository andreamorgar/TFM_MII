Place eggs in a saucepan and cover completely with cold water. Bring water to a boil. Cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, and cool. Peel eggs. Chop into eighths, and transfer to a medium salad bowl. Cube cucumbers and pickled cucumbers, and add to eggs. Mix in mayonnaise. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled.
