Combine oats, almond butter, chocolate chips, honey, chia seeds, ground flax seeds, and coconut in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat together, gradually increasing speed, until mixture no longer sticks to the center of the paddle. Shape mixture into 1-inch balls with your hands. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Freeze balls until firm, about 30 minutes. Transfer to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator.
