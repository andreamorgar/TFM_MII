Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, applesauce, sugar and honey until smooth. Mix in the lemon zest. Combine the cream of wheat, baking powder and cardamom; stir into the creamed mixture. Blend in the yogurt and egg whites. Try not to overmix, or the bars will fall. Finally, mix in the coconut and sliced almonds if you like them. Spread the mixture evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes in the preheated oven, until the edges are brown but not the top. Cool and cut into bars.
