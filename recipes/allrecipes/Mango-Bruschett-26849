Preheat the broiler. Arrange French bread slices in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Broil in the preheated oven 1 to 2 minutes per side, until lightly toasted. Remove from heat. In a medium bowl, mix mango and fresh basil. Top each bread slice with equal amounts of the mango and basil mixture. Sprinkle with Romano cheese, adjusting the amount to taste. Return topped bread to broiler. Broil 2 to 3 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and lightly browned. Serve hot.
