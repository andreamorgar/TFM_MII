Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spread tortilla chips onto the prepared baking sheet. Mix Monterey Jack cheese, shrimp, mayonnaise, chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, cilantro, minced onion, cumin, and black pepper together in a bowl. Spoon mixture onto the tortilla chips. Bake in the preheated oven for 3 minutes. Turn on the broiler and broil nachos until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Allow nachos to sit at room temperature for about 2 minutes before serving.
