Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat brown sugar, margarine, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy. Beat in eggs until well blended; add milk and vanilla. Sift flour, baking soda, cloves, salt, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Add flour mixture to sugar mixture and beat until combined. Stir oats, raisins, and walnuts into sugar mixture; chill dough for at least 30 minutes. Drop dough 2 to 3 inches apart by rounded tablespoons onto baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until golden, about 10 minutes.
