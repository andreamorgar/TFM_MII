Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as a Bundt(R)). Cream butter and sugar together in a mixing bowl until thoroughly combined. Beat in eggs, one at a time, beating each egg until fully incorporated before adding the next one. Mix in cream cheese and vanilla extract. Mix in flour, about 1/2 cup at a time, until batter is smooth and velvety. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake cake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 1 1/2 hours.
