Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl, combine the ketchup, brown sugar, 1 tablespoon lemon juice and mustard powder. In a separate large bowl, combine the ground beef, bread, onion, egg, bouillon, remaining lemon juice and 1/3 of the ketchup mixture from the small bowl. Mix this well and place in a 5x9 inch loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour, drain any excess fat, coat with remaining ketchup mixture and bake for 10 more minutes.
