Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake potatoes for 1 hour or until soft. Cut enough of the skin off the top of each potato to be able to scoop the potato out of the skin and into a mixing bowl. Add butter, sour cream, grated cheese and mix together well. Add salt and pepper to taste. Fill the skins with the mix and top with 1/2 slice American cheese. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes just until heated through.
