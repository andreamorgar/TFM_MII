Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix together flour, 1/2 cup oats, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. In another bowl, mix together sour cream, milk, honey, and sugar. Add to the flour mixture, and mix just until well blended. Stir in melted butter or margarine. Turn dough onto a lightly sprayed baking sheet. Shape into a round, lightly mounded circle, about 8 inches diameter. Brush the top of the loaf with melted butter or margarine, and sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon oats. With a knife, score the top of the loaf into quarters. Bake for about 40 minutes, or until browned. Cool completely before slicing.
