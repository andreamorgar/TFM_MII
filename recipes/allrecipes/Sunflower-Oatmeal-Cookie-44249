Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, cream together the white sugar, brown sugar, and butter until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder, and baking soda; stir into the creamed mixture until just blended. Mix in the rolled oats and sunflower seeds. Stir in coconut if desired. Drop dough by heaping teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets. Leave room for spreading. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the cookies begin to brown around the edge. Allow cookies to set for a few minutes on the sheet before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
