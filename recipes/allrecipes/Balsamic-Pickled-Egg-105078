Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, and peel. Place the onion, balsamic, water, sugar, and garlic in a saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil, then remove from stovetop, and allow to cool to room temperature. Place the eggs in a glass jar, and the vinegar over top. Cover, and refrigerate for 4 to 5 days before serving; the longer the better!
