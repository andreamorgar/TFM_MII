Whisk eggs, cinnamon, and vanilla extract together in a shallow bowl. Pour syrup into a skillet over low heat. Dip bread into egg mixture, allowing excess liquid to drip back into bowl. Wrap 4 slices bacon around each piece of bread. Dip bacon-wrapped bread back into egg mixture. Cook 1 piece bacon-wrapped bread in the syrup at a time until bacon is cooked to desired doneness, about 8 minutes per side.
