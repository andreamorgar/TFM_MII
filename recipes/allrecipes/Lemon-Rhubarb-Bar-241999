Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix 2 cups flour, butter, and 1/2 cup white sugar together in a bowl until crumbly; press into the bottom of a 12x9-inch baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until crust is light brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Beat eggs, 1 cup sugar, and 6 tablespoons flour together in a bowl until smooth; add rhubarb, coconut, lemon juice, and vanilla extract and stir to coat. Pour the rhubarb mixture over the crust. Bake in preheated oven until the fruit layer is set, 35 to 40 minutes. Let bars cool completely before serving.
