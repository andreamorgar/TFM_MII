Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour and salt; stir into the creamed mixture until well blended. Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. When cookies have cooled, turn them over and look at the bottom to see the "brown rim".
