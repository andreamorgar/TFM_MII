Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt into a bowl, and set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Stir in the lemon zest, honey, nutmeg and egg until well blended, then mix in the sweet potato. Stir in the flour using a large spoon until just blended in. Form tablespoons of dough into balls, and place onto ungreased baking sheets about 2 inches apart. Bake for 7 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges are starting to brown lightly. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
