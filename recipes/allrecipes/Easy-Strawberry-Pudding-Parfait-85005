Prepare vanilla pudding according to package directions, except do not chill. In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, stir together strawberries, jam, and sugar until jam is melted and the mixture is heated through, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. In each of 4 parfait glasses, layer 1/8 of the pudding and 1/8 of the strawberry sauce. Repeat layers. Chill 45 minutes, or until set, before serving.
