Place fruit in a baking dish, cut side up and pour cider over top. Sprinkle tops with sugar and cook at 425 degrees F for 17 minutes and finish under the broiler until browned. To make soft serve, place ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. Serve under fruit immediately or chill in freezer in a dish for 1 hour to make more scoopable. Sprinkle with chia seeds and blueberries.
