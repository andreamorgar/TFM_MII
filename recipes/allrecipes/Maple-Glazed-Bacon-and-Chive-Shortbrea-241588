Grease an 8-inch (20 cm) square baking pan; reserve. In a large bowl, beat the butter with the sugar and salt using an electric mixer, for 2 minutes or until light and fluffy. Add the bacon and chives; mix until evenly distributed. Combine the all purpose flour with the rice flour. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture; stir until just combined. Press the dough, in an even layer, into the prepared pan. Cover and chill for 30 minutes or until firm. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Lightly score the dough with a knife into 16 squares (do not cut all the way through the dough). Brush the top with maple syrup. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes or until set and lightly golden. Immediately cut through the scored wedges. Transfer pan to a wire rack and cool completely.
