Mix digestive crumbs and butter together in a bowl. Pour into an 8-inch cake pan and press into an even layer over the bottom using the back of a spoon. Chill until firm, about 30 minutes. Combine stout beer and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until syrupy and the consistency of caramel, about 40 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. Beat heavy cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Whisk mascarpone cheese and honey together in a bowl. Fold in whipped cream and lemon juice. Combine water and gelatin sheets in a microwave-safe bowl. Let gelatin soften, about 5 minutes. Drain. Heat in the microwave until melted, about 10 seconds. Pour cooled beer mixture over the mascarpone mixture; add gelatin. Beat well until smooth. Spread over the digestive biscuit crust. Chill until set, at least 1 hour.
