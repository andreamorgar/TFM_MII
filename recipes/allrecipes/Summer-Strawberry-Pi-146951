Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place a drip pan on lowest shelf to catch pie juices. To Make Topping: In a medium bowl, mix until fluffy the 3/4 cup SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, 3/4 cup flour, butter, and nutmeg. Place cleaned strawberries in a deep bowl. In a separate bowl, mix together the 1/2 cup SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, 1/2 cup flour, and cornstarch. Gently coat berries with this mixture; be careful not to crush berries. Pour berries into prepared pie crust mounding them in the middle; mounding is necessary as the berries will sink as they bake. Cover berries with crumb topping and top crumbs with about 15 pea-sized blobs of butter. Wrap edges of pie crust with foil to prevent burning. Bake pie in preheated oven for 20 minutes, then reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and bake for an additional 40 minutes. When there are 10 minutes left of baking, sprinkle a little extra SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener over crumb topping and then finish baking.
