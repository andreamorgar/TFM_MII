In a food processor, pulse Gluten Free Original Pretzel Crisps(R) Minis to a fine crumb consistency. Mix in a bowl with vegetable oil and set aside. Place strawberries, cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, yogurt, and almond milk into a food processor. Mix on low until strawberries are broken down and ingredients are combined and creamy. Pour strawberry mixture into a Popsicle(R) mold or any silicone mold. Carefully press Pretzel Crisp(R) crumbs on top to cover. Stick a Popsicle(R) stick or decorative straw into each mold and freeze until hard.
