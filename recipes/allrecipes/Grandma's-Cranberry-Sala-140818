Put cranberries in a food processor and blend until well chopped. Transfer cranberries to a large bowl, and mix in pineapple, pecans, marshmallows and sugar. In a medium bowl, beat cream with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Fold whipped cream into cranberry mixture. Chill until ready to serve. (Or, freeze for 2 hours before serving.)
