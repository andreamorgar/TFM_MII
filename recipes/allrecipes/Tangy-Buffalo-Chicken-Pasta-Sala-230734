Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain and cool. Mix pasta, chicken, celery, roasted red pepper, and 1 tablespoon of reserved roasted red pepper juice in a salad bowl. Stir mayonnaise, hot sauce, Gorgonzola cheese, and Worcestershire sauce together in a separate bowl until thoroughly combined. Pour dressing over pasta mixture and toss lightly to coat. Chill before serving.
