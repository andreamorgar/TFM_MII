Place ladyfingers on the bottom and around the edge of a 9 inch springform pan. In a medium bowl, whip cream until peaks form. In a large bowl, beat together the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Gently fold in the whipped cream. Spoon 1/2 of cream cheese mixture into springform pan; cover with a layer of lady fingers and add remaining cream cheese mixture. Layer remaining ladyfingers and top with fruit pie filling. Chill before serving.
