Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Place the eggplant slices on the prepared baking sheet, and brush them generously with olive oil. Place garlic slices on top of the eggplant. Bake the eggplant in the preheated oven until soft and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Place the roasted eggplant slices and garlic into the work bowl of a food processor with the garbanzo beans and salt, and process until smooth.
