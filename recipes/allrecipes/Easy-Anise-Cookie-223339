Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets. Beat eggs and brown sugar together in a large bowl until smooth. Stir anise seed and salt into the egg mixture. Dissolve baking soda in hot water; stir into the egg mixture. Add flour and mix into a dough. Form into 36 small balls. Spread white sugar into a wide, shallow dish. Roll the cookie dough balls in the sugar to coat. Arrange onto prepared baking sheets about 1 inch apart. Bake in preheated oven until edges are crispy, about 10 minutes.
