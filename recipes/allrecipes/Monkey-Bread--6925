Mix together 3/4 cup sugar and cinnamon. Quarter the biscuits with kitchen shears. Dip shears in water after each cut to keep the biscuits from getting too sticky. Dip biscuits into sugar mixture, and place in a greased tube pan. Do this until all biscuits are used. Melt butter or margarine, and mix in 3/4 cup sugar. Pour mixture over biscuits. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven for 30 to 35 minutes.
