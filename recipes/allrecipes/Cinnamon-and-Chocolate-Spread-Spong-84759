Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8-inch round cake pan, or line with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, mix together the butter and sugar until smooth. Stir in the milk and beaten eggs until well blended. Combine the self-rising flour, baking powder and cinnamon; stir until the batter until smooth. Pour about three quarters of the batter into the prepared cake pan. Spoon in the chocolate hazelnut spread, and swirl into the batter using two fingers. Pour the rest of the batter into the pan, and carefully spread out to the sides. Sprinkle the white chocolate chips over the top. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until nicely browned and springy to the touch.
