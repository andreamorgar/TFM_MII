Heat butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the zucchini and garlic; cook until the zucchini is tender. Stir in wine, blue cheese, cream, and pepper; simmer 10 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to boil. Add fettuccini, and cook until tender, about 6 to 8 minutes. Drain, rinse under warm water, and drain again. Return pasta to the pot, and toss with sauce over low heat. Serve with Parmesan and parsley sprinkled over the top.
