Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a large bowl, cream the shortening with the brown sugar and white sugar. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg; stir into the creamed mixture. Then stir in the rolled oats, marmalade and raisins. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks.
