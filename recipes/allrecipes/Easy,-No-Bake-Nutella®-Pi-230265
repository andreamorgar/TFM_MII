Spread 1/4 cup of the hazelnut spread over the bottom of the graham cracker crust. Beat remaining hazelnut spread and cream cheese together in a bowl until smooth. Fold whipped topping into the cream cheese mixture; pour into the pie crust and spread evenly. Refrigerate until well chilled, 4 hours to overnight.
