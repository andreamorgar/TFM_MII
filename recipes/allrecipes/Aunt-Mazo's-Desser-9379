Remove labels from the cans of milk and put them unopened into a large pot of gently boiling water. Boil for about 3 hours. Make sure the water doesn't boil away or the cans will explode (or so I'm told). After 3 hours, take the cans out and cool in fridge. When chilled, open the cans and put the results into a bowl. Beat the whipping cream, and fold into the "caramel sauce" (cooked, cooled condensed milk). Mix in the nuts and cherries.
