Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt pan. Combine apples and sugar. Make sure apples are measured exactly or cake will be too heavy and mushy. Let stand a few minutes. In a large bowl, beat eggs slightly, then beat in oil and vanilla. Mix in flour, soda, cinnamon and salt. Stir in apple mixture and chopped walnuts. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
