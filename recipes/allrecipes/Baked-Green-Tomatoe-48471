Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking sheet. In a small bowl, mix the cornmeal, dill, salt, and pepper. Dip tomato slices into the mixture, coating both sides. Arrange coated slices in a single layer on a medium baking sheet. Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until crisp and golden brown.
