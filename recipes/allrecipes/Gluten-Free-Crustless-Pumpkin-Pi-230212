Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Beat eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger in a bowl until blended. Stir in milk and pumpkin until mixture is smooth; transfer to a 9-inch glass pie dish. Sprinkle with pecans. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes; reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until set, 30 to 40 minutes more. Cool for at least 1 hour before slicing and serving.
