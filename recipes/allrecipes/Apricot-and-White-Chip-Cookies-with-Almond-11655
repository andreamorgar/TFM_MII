Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Stir in the dry ingredients until well blended, then stir in the white chips, almonds, and apricots. Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls onto an unprepared cookie sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Cookies should be golden brown. Remove from the baking sheet to cool on wire racks.
