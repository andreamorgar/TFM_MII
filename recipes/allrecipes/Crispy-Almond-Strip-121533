In a bowl, cut butter in flour until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. With a fork, stir in sour cream until blended. Divide in half; shape each half into a ball and flatten. Wrap tightly and freeze for 20 minutes. Sprinkle 1/3 cup sugar on a lightly floured surface; roll each portion of dough into a 12-in. square. Combine almonds, cinnamon and remaining sugar; sprinkle over dough. Using a rolling pin, press nut mixture into dough. Cut into 1-in. strips; cut each strip widthwise into thirds. Place 1 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 400 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until golden brown.
