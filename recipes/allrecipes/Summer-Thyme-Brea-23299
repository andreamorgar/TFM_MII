Place ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select Dough cycle; press Start. At end of cycle, remove dough onto a floured board, shape into a ball, cover and let rest for 15 minutes. Shape into a loaf, place in a lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pan, and let rise, covered, for 45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Slash top of loaf with a sharp knife or razor blade. Sprinkle a bit of flour on top. Bake in preheated 375 degree oven for 30 minutes, or until loaf is golden brown and sound hollow when tapped. Remove loaf onto a wire rack and let cool.
