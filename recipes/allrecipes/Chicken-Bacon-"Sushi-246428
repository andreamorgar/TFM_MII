Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Measure out a 20-inch square piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet. Lay out slices of bacon side-by-side, overlapping slightly, to create an even layer on the parchment paper. Combine ground chicken with barbeque seasoning; spread evenly onto the bacon layer from edge to edge. Place Havarti cheese slices lengthwise on top. Lift the parchment paper to help you roll a log, starting with the edge of bacon closest to you. Bake in the preheated oven, rotating baking sheet every 15 minutes, until bacon is crispy and chicken is cooked through; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 1 hour. Remove from oven and cool until easily handled, about 15 minutes. Slice into bite-sized "sushi".
