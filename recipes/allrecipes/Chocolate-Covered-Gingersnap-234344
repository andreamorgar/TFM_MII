Place a baking sheet in the refrigerator to chill. Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes. Dip cookies in the melted chocolate and place on the chilled baking sheet. Return baking sheet to refrigerator until chocolate is set, at least 30 seconds.
