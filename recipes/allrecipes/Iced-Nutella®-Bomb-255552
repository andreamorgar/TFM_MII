Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut biscuits into quarters and flatten each piece with your fist. Arrange in 2 mini muffin tins. Spoon 1/4 teaspoon chocolate-hazelnut spread into the center of each piece; pinch up the edges to seal. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Drizzle icing on top.
