Place eggs in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring water to a boil and remove saucepan from heat. Let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Drain, cool, and peel. Cut the eggs in half lengthwise and remove the yolks. In a bowl, mash the yolks and mix with mayonnaise, paprika, mustard powder, and Old Bay seasoning. Fold in the crabmeat. Spoon the mixture evenly into the hollowed egg white halves. Chill at least 1 hour before serving.
