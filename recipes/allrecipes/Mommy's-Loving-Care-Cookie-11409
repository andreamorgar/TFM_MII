Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper, or grease cookie sheets. Mix flour, salt, baking soda and unsweetened cocoa powder in a medium size mixing bowl. Cream butter, white sugar, brown sugar, egg, vanilla and water in a mixing bowl until fluffy. Blend flour mixture into the egg mixture until mixed well. Stir white chocolate and chocolate chips into the dough. Drop tablespoon-size dough approximately 1 inch from each other on cookie sheet. Bake cookies for 9 minutes.
