In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the oil, sugar, salt, 4 eggs and 4 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a firm dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Divide each portion into thirds. Shape each piece into a 15-in. rope. Place three ropes on a greased baking sheet and braid; pinch ends to seal and tuck under. Repeat with remaining dough. Cover and let rise until doubled , about 1 hour. Beat cold water and remaining egg; brush over braids. Sprinkle with sesame or poppy seeds if desired. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks to cool.
