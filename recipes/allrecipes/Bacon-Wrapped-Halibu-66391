Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until just beginning to brown, but still soft. Set aside until cooled enough to handle. Preheat your oven's broiler. Season the halibut with pepper. Wrap one piece of bacon around each cube of fish, and secure with a toothpick. Place on a baking sheet. Broil for about 5 minutes, turning once, until fish is cooked through and bacon is crisp. Transfer to a platter, and serve warm.
