Beat cream cheese, sour cream, and mayonnaise together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, and about half the mozzarella cheese. Pour mixture into a slow cooker. Sprinkled the remaining mozzarella on top. Cook on Low until cheese is melted and the dip is bubbly, 2 to 3 hours. Serve with Italian bread slices.
