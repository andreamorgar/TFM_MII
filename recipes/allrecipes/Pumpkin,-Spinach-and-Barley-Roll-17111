In a medium-size pot, bring water and barley to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer, cover and let cook 15 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large mixing bowl, combine pumpkin, barley, spinach, cumin, chili powder, and salt and pepper. Lay out a sheet of pastry and place 1/2 of the pumpkin mixture along the center horizontally. Roll the pastry over the mixture, and seal the seams with a little water. Cut stuffed pastry into thirds. Arrange portions on a cookie sheet. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 20 minutes, or until golden brown.
