Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place diced potatoes in a medium saucepan and cover with water. Place over high heat and bring to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. Drain. Place a large skillet over medium heat. Add olive oil, then onion. Toss lightly to coat. Saute onion for 5 minutes, then add cooked potatoes. Saute mixture an additional 10 minutes, until onions are caramelized and potatoes are lightly browned. Place potatoes and onions in a large bowl. Add hard-cooked eggs, olives, and raisins. Mix well. Add salt and pepper to taste. Roll out pastry and cut 32 3-inch circles. Place a heaping tablespoon of filling on one half of each circle. Fold pastry in half and crimp edges with a fork. Place empanadas on a baking sheet and brush each one with beaten egg. Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown. Serve hot.
