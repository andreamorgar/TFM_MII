Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Steam or boil carrots until tender; mash. In an electric mixer with whisk attachment or by hand, beat eggs into carrots, one at a time. Beat in sugar, vanilla and baking powder. Fold in flour. Pour into a 2 quart baking dish. Bake in preheated oven 30 minutes, until puffed and set.
