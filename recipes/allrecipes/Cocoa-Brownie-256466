Preheat oven to 350-degrees F. Grease an 8-inch baking pan and set aside. In a large bowl, beat together the melted butter and Sugar In The Raw and Stevia In The Raw. Add flour and baking powder and mix well to combine. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in vanilla extract, cocoa powder and walnuts. Mix well and pour batter into prepared baking pan. Bake for 20 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then cut into 12 squares.
