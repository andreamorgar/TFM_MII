Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Melt butter over medium heat in small saucepan. Stir continually, letting foam dissipate, just until butter begins to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk together self-rising flour and 1/4 cup white sugar in a bowl. Add milk, 1/4 cup cream, and toasted butter. Mix just until ingredients come together. Wad up dough and transfer to floured surface. Press or roll dough into a rectangle about 1-inch thick. Cut in half lengthwise, and then cut each half into 3 portions. Place shortcake pieces on prepared baking sheet. Brush with cream; sprinkle with sugar. Bake in preheated oven until gold brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Transfer shortcakes to a rack to cool completely. Sprinkle sliced strawberries with sugar; stir until sugar begins to dissolve. Refrigerate until juice from berries is extracted, about 1 hour. Whip 3/4 cup cream with 1 tablespoon sugar and a few drops of vanilla in bowl with an electric mixer. Split biscuit in half. Place bottom half in a bowl. Spoon strawberries and juice over shortbread half. Top with shortbread top and spoon on more strawberries and juice over the shortbread. Finish with a dollop of whipped cream.
