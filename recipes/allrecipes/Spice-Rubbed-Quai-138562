Marinate quail: Wash quail and pat dry. Stir together salt, black pepper, cayenne, and allspice and rub all over quail. Arrange quail in 1 layer in a baking pan and marinate, covered and chilled, at least 1 hour. Make sauce: Simmer broth, lime juice, molasses, and scallion in a small heavy saucepan, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in butter until incorporated. Season sauce with salt and pepper and keep warm. Broil quail: Arrange oven rack so that top of quail (on top of broiler pan) will be 2 inches from heat, then preheat broiler. Lightly oil broiler pan and heat under broiler until hot. Brush quail (on both sides) with olive oil and broil 2 inches from heat, turning once, until just cooked through, 6 to 10 minutes total. Serve quail drizzled with sauce.
