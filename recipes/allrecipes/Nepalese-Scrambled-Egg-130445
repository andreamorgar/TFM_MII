Heat ghee in a skillet over medium heat. Fry the onions, coriander, cumin, and cayenne pepper until the onions are soft. Stir in the curry paste and set aside. In a separate skillet, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Pour in the eggs; cook and stir until eggs are set. Mix in the onion mixture and serve garnished with fresh cilantro.
