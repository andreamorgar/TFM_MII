Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 6 muffin cups with cooking spray. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until halfway cooked, about 5 minutes. Blot bacon slices with paper towels and cut into small pieces. Mix bacon, eggs, tomatoes, green onion, and black pepper together in a bowl. Pour mixture into the prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until each muffin is set in the middle, 15 to 20 minutes.
