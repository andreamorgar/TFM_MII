Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners. Stir milk and vinegar together in a small bowl; set aside to sour for 3 to 5 minutes. Beat white sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy and smooth. Add eggs, egg yolk, soured milk, and lemon zest; beat until smooth, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Mix rice flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt in a bowl; slowly stir flour mixture into creamed butter mixture until just mixed. Gently fold in blueberries. Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each about 3/4 full. Sprinkle each muffin with raw sugar. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes.
