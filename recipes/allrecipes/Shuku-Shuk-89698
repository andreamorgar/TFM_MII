Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together the coconut, sugar and egg yolks to form a stiff dough. Squeeze into 1 inch balls, and roll each ball in flour to coat. Place on a baking sheet, spacing about 2 inches apart. Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden.
