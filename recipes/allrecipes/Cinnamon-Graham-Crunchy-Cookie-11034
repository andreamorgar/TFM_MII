In a large bowl, cream butter, sugar and brown sugar until fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla and beat until smooth. In another bowl, mix flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Add dry ingredients to creamed mixture and stir until it becomes a soft dough. Stir in oats, chocolate chips, pecans, and 1 cup of graham cracker crumbs. Drop teaspoonfuls of dough into remaining graham cracker crumbs and coat well. Place on a lightly greased baking sheet and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10-13 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on wire rack and store in airtight container.
