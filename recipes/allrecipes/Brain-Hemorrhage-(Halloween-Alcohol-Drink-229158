Pour schnapps into a shot glass. Very gently pour Irish cream liqueur over the schnapps. Wait until the Irish cream liqueur begins to clump and 'curdle' to look like a brain, just a few moments. Gently pour a tiny amount of grenadine 'blood' over the brain. Watch your guests gag over the look of one of the nastiest-looking Halloween drinks around. But they are yummy!
