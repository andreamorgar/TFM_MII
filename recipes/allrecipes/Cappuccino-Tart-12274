In a small bowl, beat together eggs, coffee liqueur, and sugar. In a small saucepan, combine milk and coffee granules; heat over medium high heat for 2 to 3 minutes, until milk is steaming and tiny bubbles appear around edge of saucepan. Beat milk into eggs. Strain egg mixture through sieve into a pitcher. Carefully pour egg mixture into tart shells, filling evenly (tarts will be very full). Sprinkle each tart with a little cinnamon. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees) for 20 to 25 minutes, or until filling is set and tart shells are golden brown. Cool before serving.
