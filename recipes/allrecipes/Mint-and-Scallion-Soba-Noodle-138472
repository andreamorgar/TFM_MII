Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling water until just tender, about 5 minutes, then drain in a colander. Rinse under cold water to stop cooking, then drain well. While noodles are cooking, stir together vinegar, oil, soy sauce, sugar, and salt until sugar is dissolved. Toss noodles with dressing, mint, and scallions.
