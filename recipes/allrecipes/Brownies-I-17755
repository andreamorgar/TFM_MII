Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan. In a large bowl, beat together the eggs, oil and vanilla until well blended. Stir in the walnuts and cake mix until smooth. Spread evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick or knife inserted into the center, comes out clean. Cool in pan on a wire rack and cut into squares.
