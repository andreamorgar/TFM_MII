Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spread garbanzo beans in a baking dish and pat dry with a paper towel. Bake in the preheated oven, stirring halfway through, about 22 minutes. Toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Return to the baking dish. Continue baking chickpeas, stirring halfway through, until golden and dry on the outside, about 22 minutes more.
