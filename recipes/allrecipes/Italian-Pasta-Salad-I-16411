In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta until al dente, rinse under cold water and drain. Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil; cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop. In a large bowl, combine the pasta, eggs, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, bell pepper, green onions and parsley. Prepare the dressing by mixing together the mayonnaise, vinegar, Italian seasoning and pepper. Pour dressing over pasta mixture and toss well to coat. Refrigerate until chilled and serve.
