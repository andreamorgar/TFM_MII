Spread butter onto one side of each slice of bread. Place bread butter sides down in the pie iron. Spread half of the peanut butter onto the exposed side of each piece of bread. Stick the marshmallows to one side and the chocolate chips to the other. Close the pie maker. Roast over a campfire for about 3 minutes on each side, until the bread is toasted. It should be nice and golden like a grilled cheese with chips melted and marshmallows gooey.
