Line a baking sheet with wax or parchment paper. Melt the almond bark in the top of a double boiler over just-barely simmering water, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes. Mix the cheese-flavored snacks into the melted almond bark until fully incorporated. Spread the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet in an even layer. Allow to cool completely. Cut into 1 1/2-inch squares.
