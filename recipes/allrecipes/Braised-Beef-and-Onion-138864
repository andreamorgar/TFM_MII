Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Pat meat dry. Stir together allspice, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl and rub all over meat. Spread half of onions and half of garlic in a 13- by 9-inch roasting pan and arrange meat on top. Spread remaining onions and garlic over meat. Tightly cover pan with foil and roast, turning meat over after 1 hour, until meat is very tender, about 2 1/2 hours total. Skim fat from pan juices. Slice meat across the grain and sprinkle with parsley. Serve with onions and pan juices.
