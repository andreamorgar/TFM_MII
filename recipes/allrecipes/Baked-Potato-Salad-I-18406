Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add whole potatoes to large pot of boiling, salted water. Boil for 20 minutes, or until tender. Remove potatoes from the water and set aside to cool. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. Peel and cube cooled potatoes, and transfer to a large bowl. Add onion, mayonnaise, cheese, salt and pepper, and mix together with the potatoes. Place mixture in a lightly oiled 9x11 inch baking dish. Top with the crumbled bacon and the olives. Bake uncovered for 40 minutes.
