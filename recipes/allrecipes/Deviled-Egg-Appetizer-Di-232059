Pour off hot water and place eggs in a bowl full of ice water to cool. Peel and halve eggs. Chop about half the egg whites and place into a bowl. Put remaining egg whites and yolks in a food processor with mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, white wine vinegar, and hot sauce; process till smooth and transfer to a bowl.
