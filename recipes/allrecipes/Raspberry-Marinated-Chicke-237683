Whisk raspberry jam, lemon juice, salt, ginger, and pepper together in a bowl; add chicken and turn to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight. Remove chicken from the marinade and shake to remove excess liquid. Discard the remaining marinade. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken in oil until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
