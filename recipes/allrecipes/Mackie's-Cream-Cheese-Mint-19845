In medium bowl, cream together confectioners' sugar and cream cheese until smooth. Divide into three sections and mix peppermint extract and green food coloring into the first, butter flavored extract and 1/2 teaspoon yellow food coloring into the second, and lemon extract and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon yellow food coloring into the third. Roll each section out onto a flat surface and cut with small cookie cutters, or press into candy molds. Allow individual mints to air dry for 2 hours. Then refrigerate or freeze until serving.
