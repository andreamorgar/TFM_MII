Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups with butter or line with paper muffin liners. Stir sugar, oil, mayonnaise, and eggs together until creamy and light yellow. Mix in bananas until incorporated. Stir flour, oats, flax, wheat germ, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into banana mixture until smooth. Mix in chocolate chips and walnuts. Spoon batter into prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 25 minutes.
