Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, eggs, rolled oats, minced onion flakes, hot pepper sauce and seasoning salt. Mix well and form into 1 inch meatballs. Place into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a separate medium bowl, combine the ketchup, water, vinegar, brown sugar, minced onion flakes, dry mustard, Worcestershire sauce and hot pepper sauce. Mix together well and set aside. Remove meatballs from oven and pour reserved sauce over them. Cover with foil and return to oven. Bake, covered, in a preheated oven for 1 hour.
