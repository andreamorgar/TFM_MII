Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8 or 9 inch layer pans or one 9 or 10 inch kugelhopf pan. Cream butter, add sugar and blend, beat in the eggs. Sift the cream of tartar and baking soda with the flour twice before adding it to the creamed mixture alternately with the milk and vanilla. (Put in a cup of raisins or walnuts if you wish - it is really great). Pour batter into prepared pan(s). Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes in the layer pans or 45 minutes in the kugelhopf pan,
