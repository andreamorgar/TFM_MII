Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10x15 inch baking dish. Whisk together the flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice in a bowl. Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl. Whisk in the white sugar, canola oil, and pumpkin puree until no lumps of pumpkin puree remain. Stir in the carrots and pineapple, then fold in the flour mixture until no lumps of flour remain. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares. While the pumpkin bars are cooling, beat the cream cheese, butter, vanilla extract, and confectioners' sugar together in a bowl until smooth. Frost the cooled bars with the cream cheese frosting.
