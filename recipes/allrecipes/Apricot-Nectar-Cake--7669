Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Combine cake mix with sugar, cooking oil, and apricot nectar. Beat for two minutes with mixer. Add eggs one at a time, beating for 30 seconds after each addition. Pour batter into pan. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes in the pan before turning out onto a plate. In a small bowl, mix lemon juice with confectioners' sugar until you reach desired consistency. Drizzle glaze over sides of warm cake.
