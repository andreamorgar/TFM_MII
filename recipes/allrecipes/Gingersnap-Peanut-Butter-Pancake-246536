Whisk flour, milk, gingersnaps, peanut butter, butter, sugar, egg, baking powder, ginger, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl until smooth batter forms. Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Pour 1/2 cup batter onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
