Butter a 10x15 inch jellyroll pan. Melt butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Stir in sugar and water. Bring to a boil and add almonds. Cook, stirring constantly until nuts are toasted and the sugar is golden. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan; do not spread. Immediately sprinkle the chocolate chips on top. Let stand for a minute, then spread the chocolate over the top. Let cool completely, then break into pieces.
