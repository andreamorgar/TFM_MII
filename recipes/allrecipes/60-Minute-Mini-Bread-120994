In a mixing bowl, combine 2 cups flour, sugar, salt and yeast. In a saucepan, heat the water, milk and butter to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Do not let rise. Divide in half. Roll each portion into an 8-in. x 5-in. rectangle. Roll up, jelly-roll style, starting with a short side; pinch seam to seal. Place, seam side down, in two greased 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Fill a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan with 1 in. of hot water. Set loaf pans in water. Cover and let rise for 15 minutes. Remove loaf pans from the water bath. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
