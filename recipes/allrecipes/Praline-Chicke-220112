Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a casserole dish. Place flour in a shallow bowl and press chicken strips into the flour; tap to remove excess flour. Dip floured chicken in the egg and again coat with flour. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry chicken strips until golden brown and the meat is no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes per side; drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat and stir in brown sugar, maple syrup, pecans, and Creole seasoning. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook for 1 minute. Place chicken strips into the prepared casserole dish; pour praline sauce over chicken and toss chicken to coat with sauce. Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling, 10 to 15 minutes.
