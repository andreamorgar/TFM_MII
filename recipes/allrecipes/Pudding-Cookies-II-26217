Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a large bowl, stir together the cake mix and instant pudding. Stir in the sour cream and eggs until well blended. Batter will be stiff. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. When cool, frost with chocolate frosting if desired.
