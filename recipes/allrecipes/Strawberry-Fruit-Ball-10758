Mix all the ingredients except the 3 ounce box of gelatin. Cover mixture and place in the refrigerator overnight. The next day, roll mixture into strawberry shapes. Place the 3 ounce box of gelatin in a plate, and roll the shaped strawberries in the gelatin until coated. Place bits of mint leaves to create the stems; secure the stems with a piece of toothpick.
