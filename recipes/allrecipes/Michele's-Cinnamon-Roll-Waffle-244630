Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions and spray with non-stick cooking spray. Whisk whole wheat flax flour, white sugar, baking powder, and baking soda together in a large bowl. Whisk eggs, buttermilk, 1 tablespoon melted butter, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; pour into flour mixture and stir just until batter is combined. Pour about 1/3 cup batter into waffle iron; close lid and bake until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter, keeping waffles warm. Whisk brown sugar, 3 tablespoons melted butter, hot water, and cinnamon together in a small microwave-safe bowl; cook in the microwave on High until cinnamon drizzle can be poured, about 10 seconds. Whisk confectioners' sugar, skim milk, and 1 tablespoon melted butter together in a small bowl until icing drizzle is smooth and can be poured. Place 2 waffles on a plate; drizzle with 2 tablespoons cinnamon drizzle, then drizzle with 2 tablespoons icing drizzle.
