Cook, peel and mash the sugar pumpkin. Sift flour, baking powder and baking soda together. Gradually add pumpkin, sugar and water to make a soft dough. When it just holds together, knead several minutes. Divide dough into 4 - 6 equal parts. Knead each portion again several minutes or until it becomes a soft, smooth ball. Roll out each portion 1/4 inch thick. Another method is to pinch off small pieces of dough and form into individual cakes 2 - 3 inch across. In a large iron skillet, fry in very hot vegetable oil (about 1inch in depth) until brown on one side. Flip over and brown other side. The bread will puff up and get crisp and chewy. Sprinkle with granulated sugar.
