Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk almond meal, slivered almonds, 1/4 cup sugar, baking soda, and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl; stir in butter until almond mixture is evenly moistened. Pour almond mixture into a 10-inch springform pan and press firmly into the bottom. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is set, about 10 minutes. Remove crust from oven and reduce temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place a pan of hot water onto the bottom rack of the oven to help reduce cracking in the cheesecake. Beat cream cheese, sour cream, pumpkin puree, 1 cup sugar, eggs, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, ginger, vanilla extract, and salt together in a large bowl using an electric mixer, scraping bottom and sides of bowl frequently, until filling is smooth. Pour filling over hot crust. Place pan on the center rack in oven and bake until cheesecake peaks in the center, 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature before removing sides of pan. Transfer cheesecake to a serving plate and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Chill in refrigerator before serving, at least 2 hours.
