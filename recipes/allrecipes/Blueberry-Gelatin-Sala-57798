In a large bowl, mix together gelatin powder, boiling water, pineapple and pie filling. Pour into a mold, or glass baking dish, and refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours. In a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese, sour cream, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Spread over the top of the gelatin. If using a mold, unmold the gelatin before applying topping.
