Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a medium bowl, cream together the margarine and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg yolks, vanilla and port wine. Combine the flour and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls. Dip each ball in the remaining egg whites. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove from the oven and immediately place 4 or 5 of the chocolate and/or peanut butter chips into the center of each cookie. Return to the oven for 2 more minutes to melt the chips. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks.
