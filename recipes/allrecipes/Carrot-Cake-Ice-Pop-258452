Combine baby carrots, milk, brown sugar, white sugar, cinnamon, ginger, salt, and nutmeg in a blender; blend until smooth. Add ice cream and continue blending until evenly mixed. Pour carrot mixture into molds and freeze until slushy, about 1 hour. Remove from freezer and stir in walnuts evenly; insert pop sticks and freeze until solid, 3 to 6 hours.
