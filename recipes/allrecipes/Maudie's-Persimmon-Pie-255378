Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press pie crust into an 8-inch pie pan; trim edges. Mix sugar, flour, and salt together in a bowl. Beat milk, egg, vanilla extract, and butter together with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Add persimmon pulp; beat until blended. Pour into the pie crust. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown and persimmon filling is set, about 45 minutes.
