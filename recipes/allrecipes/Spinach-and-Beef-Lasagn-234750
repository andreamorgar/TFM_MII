Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot pot with garlic, oregano, and basil until beef is completely browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir spaghetti sauce and spinach into ground beef mixture; simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir ricotta cheese, 8 ounces mozzarella cheese, parsley, Parmesan cheese, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Spread a small amount of sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch pan. Arrange lasagna noodles in a single layer over the sauce. Spread another layer of sauce over the top and arrange another layer of lasagna noodles over sauce. Spread 1/2 the remaining sauce and 1/2 the cheese mixture over the top. Repeat layers, finishing with sauce. Cover pan with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 55 minutes, remove aluminum foil, sprinkle lasagna with 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, and bake until noodles are cooked through and sauce is bubbling, about 15 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
