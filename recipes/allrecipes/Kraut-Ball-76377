Brown sausage in a medium skillet over medium high heat, stirring to break apart. Drain, and place in a bowl. Stir in softened cream cheese, drained sauerkraut, and mustard until thoroughly combined. Cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place beaten eggs and crushed crackers in separate bowls. Roll sausage mixture into small balls and dip first into egg, then roll in cracker crumbs to coat. Arrange on a sheet pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, turning once for even browning. Serve warm.
