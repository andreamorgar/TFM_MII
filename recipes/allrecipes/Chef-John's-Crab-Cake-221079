Mix saltine crackers, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, seafood seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, egg, salt, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. Stir in crabmeat until mixture is combined but still chunky. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Sprinkle breadcrumbs on a plate. Shape chilled crab mixture into 4 small thick patties; coat completely with bread crumbs. Melt butter in a skillet over medium-heat; cook crab cakes until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side.
