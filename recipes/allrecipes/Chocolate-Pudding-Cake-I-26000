Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt(R) pan. In a large bowl, stir together cake mix and pudding mix. Make a well in the center and pour in sour cream, eggs, water and oil. Beat on low speed until blended. Scrape bowl, and beat 4 minutes on medium speed. Stir in chocolate chips. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a serving plate. Serve warm. Alternate cooking directions: Pour batter into a 5 quart slow cooker that has been coated with non stick cooking spray. Cover and cook on low for 6 hours. Spoon into individual dishes.
