Place a rack in the top third of the oven and preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Mix olive oil, Dijon mustard, sea salt, and red pepper flakes in a large bowl to make sauce. Trim the stems of the Brussels sprouts to release outermost leaves, about 5 leaves from each sprout. Reserve cores to roast another time. Place leaves in the bowl of sauce; toss with your fingers until all the leaves are evenly coated. Spread leaves on the baking sheet in a single layer. Roast leaves in the preheated oven until wilted and lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Transfer any crispy leaves to a serving plate and continue roasting, removing crispy leaves at 5-minute intervals, until all leaves are crispy, about 10 minutes more.
