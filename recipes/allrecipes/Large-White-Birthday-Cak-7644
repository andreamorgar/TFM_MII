Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 x 13 inch pan. Sift together cake flour, baking powder, and salt. In a large bowl, combine shortening, sugar, yolks, and vanilla; beat with mixer. Add sifted flour mixture alternately with milk in three parts; continue to beat until just blended. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake for about 35 minutes. Remove from pan, and cool on a wire rack. Ice with Fluffy Boiled Icing. Sprinkle with coconut and chopped maraschino cherries if you wish.
