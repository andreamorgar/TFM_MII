Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place cream cheese in a medium baking dish with 3/4 of the artichoke hearts and Old Bay Seasoning TM. Blend until smooth. Gently fold in crabmeat, taking care not to break up lumps. Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until surface is golden brown. Remove from heat and garnish with remaining artichoke hearts.
