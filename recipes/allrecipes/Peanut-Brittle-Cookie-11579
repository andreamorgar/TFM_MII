Preheat oven to 325 degrees F ( 165 degrees C ). Grease a 15x9 inch pan. In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and the sugar. Mix in the egg and vanilla. Sift together the flour, baking soda and cinnamon; stir into the creamed mixture. Then stir in 1 cup of the peanuts. Spread the mixture evenly into the prepared baking pan. Sprinkle the remaining peanuts over the top. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until edges pull away from the sides of the pan. Cool and cut into bars.
