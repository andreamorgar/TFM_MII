Have ready 2 (12 ounce) canning jars. Put the instant coffee into a food processor, and process to a fine powder. If you don't have a food processor, put it into a large plastic bag, and crush with a rolling pin. In a large bowl, combine creamer, chocolate mix, instant coffee, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Stir together until well mixed. Spoon into 2 - 12 ounce jars. Attach a note to each jar that reads: Cappuccino: Mix 3 tablespoons of powder with 6 fluid ounces hot water.
