Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Beat butter in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat honey, egg, and lavender into the creamed butter until incorporated. Stir flour, 1/2 cup at a time, into butter mixture until blended. Drop spoonfuls of batter onto the prepared baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are browned on the bottom, about 15 minutes.
