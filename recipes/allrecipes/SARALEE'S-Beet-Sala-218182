Place the beets into a saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, and gently boil the beets until tender, about 45 minutes. Remove from heat, allow the beets to cool, and peel. Shred the beets using a box grater. In a salad bowl, mix the onion, salt, black pepper, vinegar, and sugar together lightly until thoroughly combined and the sugar has dissolved; mix in beets, chill, and serve.
