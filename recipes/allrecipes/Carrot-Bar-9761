Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan. In a small saucepan, combine sugar, carrots, spices, raisins, water, orange juice and butter. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Pour mixture into a large bowl and cool to lukewarm. Add flour, baking soda, and salt to the carrot mixture. Mix well, and stir in walnuts. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
