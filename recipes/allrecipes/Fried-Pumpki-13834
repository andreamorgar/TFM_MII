Cut pumpkin in half, remove seeds, pith and outer skin. Cut into 2x3 inch pieces. Place 1/2 of pumpkin (2 to 3 pounds) in large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Add flour and stir to evenly coat. Melt butter in a large deep skillet over medium heat. Add pumpkin and cook, turning often until golden brown and tender.
