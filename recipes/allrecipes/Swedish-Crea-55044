Combine the cream, water, sugar, and gelatin in a saucepan over low heat. Stir constantly until the gelatin has dissolved. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly until thickened, about 10 minutes; it should be the consistency of beaten eggs. Fold in the sour cream, vanilla extract, and almond extract. Pour into a mold, cover, and refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. Loosen from mold by dipping into hot water. Invert onto a serving plate to unmold. Pour lingonberries over top.
