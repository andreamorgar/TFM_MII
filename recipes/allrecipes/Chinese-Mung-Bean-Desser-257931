Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer until mung beans open up, about 1 hour. Stir in rock sugar until dissolved. Combine mung beans, rice, and barley in a saucepan. Add 8 times the volume in water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered, until rice and barley are soft, about 20 minutes.
