Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Mix sugar and ghee together until creamy; stir in vanilla extract and baking powder. Add flour in small batches until dough is thickened and combined. Roll dough into walnut-size balls and place 2 inches apart onto baking sheets. Flatten slightly and press a clove into the center. Bake in the preheated oven until ivory, 10 to 20 minutes. Cool on the sheets for 10 minutes, before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely, about 10 to 20 minutes.
