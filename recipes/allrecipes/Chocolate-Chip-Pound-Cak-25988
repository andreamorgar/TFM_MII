Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan. In a large bowl, stir together cake mix and pudding mix. Make a well in the center and pour in oil, eggs and milk. Beat on low speed until blended. Scrape bowl, and beat 4 minutes on medium speed. Stir in grated chocolate and chocolate chips. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
