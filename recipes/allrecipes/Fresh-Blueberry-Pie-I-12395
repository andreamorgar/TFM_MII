Pour one pint of the blueberries into the baked pie shell. Combine flour, butter, lemon juice and sugar. Mix thoroughly. Add the remaining pint of blueberries and bring just to a boil over medium heat. Berries should begin to pop open. Pour cooked berries over fresh berries. Chill pie and serve with whipped cream.
