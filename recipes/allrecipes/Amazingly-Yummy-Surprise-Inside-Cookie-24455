Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, beat the butter and flour together until soft and smooth. Stir in the cake mix to form a soft dough. Roll dough into 1 inch balls. Press a candy into the center of each ball, covering completely. Place 2 inches apart onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Roll cookies in confectioners sugar while still warm.
