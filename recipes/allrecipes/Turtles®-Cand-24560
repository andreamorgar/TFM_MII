Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease baking sheets. Place three pecan halves in a Y shape on cookie sheet and place caramel in center. Repeat with remaining nuts and caramels. Place in preheated oven 10 minutes, until caramel is melted. Melt chocolate chips with shortening in microwave, or in a small saucepan over low heat; stir until smooth. Spoon over candies on sheets. Chill 8 hours or overnight, until firm.
