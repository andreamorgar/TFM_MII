Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; Cook and stir cabbage, carrot, and apple until cabbage is tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender but still slightly firm, about 5 minutes. Drain well. Gently stir noodles into cabbage mixture; season to taste with salt and black pepper.
