Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Mix cake mix, water, 3 eggs, and oil in large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until well-combined, about 2 minutes. Pour batter into baking pan. Combine ricotta cheese, 6 remaining eggs, and sugar in a large bowl until smooth. Pour over cake batter in the pan. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove plastic wrap from pan. Bake cake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 70 to 75 minutes.
