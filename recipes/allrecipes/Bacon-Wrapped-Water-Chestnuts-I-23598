Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Wrap single pieces of bacon around individual water chestnuts, securing with a toothpick. Place the wrapped water chestnuts on a large baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven 20 minutes, or until the bacon is crisp. Remove from heat and drain. In a medium bowl, mix the mayonnaise, white sugar, dill pickle relish and ketchup. Pour the mixture over the wrapped water chestnuts. Bake in the preheated oven 10 minutes, or until the sauce is hot and bubbly.
