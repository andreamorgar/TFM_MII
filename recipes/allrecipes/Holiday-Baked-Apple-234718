Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut the core and seeds out of apple, leaving about a 1/2 in the bottom, creating a well-like hole. Mix 2 tablespoons brown sugar, butter, coconut, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl; fill well in the apple with brown sugar mixture. Place stuffed apple in a baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until apple is tender, about 30 minutes. Transfer baked apple to a serving bowl and drizzle any remaining juices from baking dish over apple; sprinkle with 1 pinch brown sugar and cinnamon.
