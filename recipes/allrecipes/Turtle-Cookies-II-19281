Preheat waffle iron to medium heat. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cocoa, sugar and salt. Stir in the eggs, melted margarine and vanilla until well blended. Drop batter by spoonfuls onto the sections of the preheated waffle iron. Close the waffle iron and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Carefully remove cookies and cool on wire racks.
