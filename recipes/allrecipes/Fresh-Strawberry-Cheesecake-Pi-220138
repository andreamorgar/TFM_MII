Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake pie crust until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove crust from oven and turn oven temperature down to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat cream cheese, eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, and 2 tablespoons lemon juice in a bowl until smoothly combined. Pour filling into crust. Bake until filling is set, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool completely. Whisk together 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch, water, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and strawberry gelatin in a saucepan until smooth; place over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring constantly, until the gelatin has dissolved and the glaze has thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Arrange the sliced strawberries atop the cheese filling. Pour warm glaze over sliced strawberries. Chill thoroughly in refrigerator before serving.
