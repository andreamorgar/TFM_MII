Place acorn squash, cut-side down, in a microwave-safe dish; add enough water to reach a 1-inch depth. Cook squash in microwave until tender, about 20 minutes; allow to cool until easily handled. Scoop meat out of squash and discard peel. Combine flour, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, salt, and cloves in a bowl. Blend squash meat, brown sugar, milk, eggs, and vegetable oil in a food processor until smooth; mix into flour mixture until batter is smooth. Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Spray the inside of the waffle iron with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 to 3/4 cup batter (depending on size of waffle iron) into waffle iron and cook according to manufacturer's instructions. Repeat with remaining batter.
