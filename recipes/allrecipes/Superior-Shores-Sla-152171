Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp; drain, crumble, and set aside. Make the dressing by whisking together the mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, and celery seed in a small bowl. Toss together the coleslaw mix and green onion in a large bowl; add the dressing and toss to coat; stir in the bacon. Serve immediately.
