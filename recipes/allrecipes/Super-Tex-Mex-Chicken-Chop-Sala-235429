Sprinkle chicken breast evenly with Montreal steak seasoning. Melt butter in a frying pan over medium heat; cook chicken until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 5 to 10 minutes per side. Remove chicken from pan and cut into small pieces. Mix lettuce, chicken, tomato, green bell pepper, jalapeno peppers, green chile peppers, corn, black olives, black beans, and Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend in a large bowl; gently toss. Whisk ranch dressing, reserved 3 tablespoons jalapeno juice, black pepper, and garlic powder together in a bowl; drizzle over salad. Toss to coat.
