Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Beat eggs lightly in a medium bowl. Add pumpkin, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and salt. Blend thoroughly, then beat in milk. Pour into pastry-lined pie plates. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and bake until set, 20 to 30 minutes more. Chill before serving.
