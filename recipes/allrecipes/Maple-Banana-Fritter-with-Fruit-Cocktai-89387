Warm 5 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over low heat. Stir in maple syrup. Then stir in rum, fruit cocktail juice, and lemon juice to taste. Remove from heat, and set aside. Warm 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet. Place halved bananas in skillet and fry on both sides until golden and a bit crisp on the edges. Place bananas cut-side up on dessert plates. Spoon 1 or 2 tablespoonfuls of fruit cocktail into the center of each banana. Lay a scoop of ice cream on top. Then drizzle with maple sauce.
