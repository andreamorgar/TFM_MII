Cut a short slit into each jalapeno pepper. Remove as many seeds as possible. Slice Cheddar cheese into approximately 1/4 inch by 1 inch strips. Stuff each jalapeno with a Cheddar cheese strip. Place beaten eggs in a small bowl. In a small dish, mix yellow cornmeal, flour and salt. One at a time, dip jalapenos in the eggs. Roll in the yellow cornmeal mixture until well coated. Arrange on a metal rack, and allow them to sit approximately 30 minutes. Heat corn oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In small batches, using a slotted spoon, lower peppers into the heated oil, and fry until crisp and golden brown, about 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
