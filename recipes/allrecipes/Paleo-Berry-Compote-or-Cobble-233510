Place berries in a saucepan over medium heat. Cover saucepan and cook until berries soften and begin to break apart, about 5 minutes. If berries look dry when cooking, add 1 teaspoon of water to the saucepan. Remove from heat. Whisk coconut milk and cinnamon together in a bowl. Transfer berries to a bowl; pour coconut milk mixture over berries and sprinkle almond meal on top.
