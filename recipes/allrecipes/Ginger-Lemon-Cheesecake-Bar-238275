Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix cookies, brown sugar, butter, and ground ginger together in a bowl; press into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove crust from oven and cool to room temperature. Process cream cheese, eggs, white sugar, lemon juice, and lemon extract in a food processor until smooth and creamy; spread over crust. Bake in the preheated oven until cheesecake is set, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool cheesecake to room temperature and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.
