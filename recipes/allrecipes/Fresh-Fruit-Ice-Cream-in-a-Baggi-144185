Combine the half and half, sugar, vanilla, and strawberries in a quart size resealable plastic bag. Press the air out of the bag, seal, and shake bag to combine contents. Place the bag into a gallon sized zip top bag. Add the ice to the gallon bag, press the air out, and seal bag. Wrap bags in a hand towel. Shake continuously, until the contents of the small bag thickens into soft-serve ice cream, 5 to 10 minutes. Rinse the small bag quickly under cold water to wash off salt. Lay the ice cream filled baggie on a flat surface. Use a wooden spoon handle to push the ice cream down to the bottom corner of the baggie. Snip off the corner, and squeeze ice cream into a bowl.
