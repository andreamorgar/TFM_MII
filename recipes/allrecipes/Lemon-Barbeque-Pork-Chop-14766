Place enough barbecue sauce to coat chops in a shallow dish or bowl. Add chops and smother in sauce to coat. Place chops in a medium skillet over medium high heat and saute for 20 to 25 minutes or until cooked through, sprinkling both sides generously with lemon juice while cooking. Remove from heat and serve.
