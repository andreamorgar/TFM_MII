Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble bacon pieces. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add asparagus and cook until tender yet firm to the bite, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute onion, tomato, and mushrooms until tender, about 5 minutes. Whisk eggs and cream together in a bowl; add bacon, sauteed vegetables, asparagus, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Pour egg mixture into an oven-proof nonstick skillet and cover skillet. Cook over medium-low until cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over omelette. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Broil omelette in the preheated oven until a golden crust starts to form on the top, about 2 minutes.
