Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8-inch baking dish with parchment paper. Combine beans, eggs, applesauce, cocoa powder, coffee, vanilla, baking soda, and salt in a blender or food processor. Blend batter until smooth. Pour 1/2 cup chocolate chips into batter; stir gently to combine. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish; top with remaining 1/4 cup chocolate chips. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven. Let cool completely before cutting into squares, about 15 minutes.
