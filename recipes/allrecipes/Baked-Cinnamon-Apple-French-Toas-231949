Spray a 9x13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray. Mix brown sugar, butter, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in the bottom of the prepared casserole dish. Add apples, cranberries, and pecans; toss to coat. Evenly spread apple mixture to cover bottom of dish. Arrange bread slices atop apple mixture, overlapping slightly until apple layer is completely covered. Whisk egg substitute, skim milk, vanilla extract, and 2 teaspoons cinnamon in a bowl; evenly pour over bread slices. Cover dish with aluminum foil and refrigerate 4 to 24 hours. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake the covered casserole dish in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and continue baking until lightly browned and egg mixture is set, about 5 more minutes. Let cool 5 minutes before serving.
