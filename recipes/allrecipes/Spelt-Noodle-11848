(Preferred) Process all ingredients in a food processor until they form a ball that rides on the blades. You can also let a bread machine knead the ingredients for about 5 minutes. (I've never tried this, but have heard it works well.) Pasta can be rolled and cut in a regular (manual, hand-crank) pasta maker by passing it through repeatedly smaller (i.e., higher number) settings until nearly paper thin, and then run through the cutting blades. I am told it does not do so well in an automatic pasta maker.
