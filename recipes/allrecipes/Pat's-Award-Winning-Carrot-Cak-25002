Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt pan. Sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Set aside. In a large bowl, mix the oil and sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Blend in the flour mixture just until combined. Stir in chopped pecans, carrot baby food, grated carrots, and coconut. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
