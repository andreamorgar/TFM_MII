Heat oil in a large heavy skillet or deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C). In a small bowl, mix together the flour, seasoning blend and cumin. Place the beaten egg in a shallow dish. Dip avocado slices in beaten egg, and then in the flour mixture. You may repeat the dipping process if you prefer a thicker batter. Fry the coated avocado slices in the hot oil for 3 to 5 minutes, until golden brown, turning once. Drain on paper towels, and serve hot.
