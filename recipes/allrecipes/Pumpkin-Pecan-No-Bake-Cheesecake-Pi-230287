Beat cream cheese and sugar together in a large bowl until creamy and smooth. Mix pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, and vanilla extract into cream cheese mixture, scraping down the sides of the bowl, until mixture is smooth. Fold 1/3 cup pecans into the pumpkin mixture; spread into the graham cracker crust. Sprinkle remaining pecans over pumpkin mixture. Cover pie with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until set, 4 hours. Cut pie into 8 slices and top each slice with about 1 tablespoon whipped topping.
