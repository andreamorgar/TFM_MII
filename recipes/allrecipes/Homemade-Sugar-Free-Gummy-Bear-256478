Fill a saucepan almost halfway with water; bring to a boil. Measure 1/3 cup cold water in a glass measuring cup. Dissolve gelatin in the cold water, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Stir in stevia powder and soft drink mix. Place measuring cup in the boiling water. Stir gelatin mixture until syrupy. Place candy molds on a baking sheet. Remove gelatin mixture from boiling water and immediately fill molds using a small syringe. Chill gelatin mixture until set, at least 1 hour and up to 2 days. Remove from molds.
