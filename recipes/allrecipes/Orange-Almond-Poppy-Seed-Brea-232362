Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a large loaf pan. Combine flour, salt, and baking powder in a bowl. Beat 2 1/4 cups sugar, vegetable oil, and eggs in another bowl until smooth. Stir milk, poppy seeds, 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 1/2 teaspoon almond extract, and 1 1/2 teaspoon butter extract into egg mixture. Add flour mixture; mix until batter is just moistened. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Whisk 3/4 cup sugar, orange juice, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/2 teaspoon almond extract, and 1/2 teaspoon butter extract in a bowl until smooth. Pour orange juice glaze over hot poppy seed loaf.
