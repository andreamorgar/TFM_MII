Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift together the flour and baking soda. In a separate bowl, cream together the butter, sugar, vanilla sugar, and golden syrup; mix well. Stir in the flour and mix until just incorporated. Form dough into two, 1 inch thick elongated rolls the length of your cookie pan. Place them on the cookie pan with enough space in between for them to spread. Bake in preheated oven until they are light golden brown and have flattened; about 20 to 22 minutes if using margarine, or 13 to 15 minutes if using butter. Remove from oven and let cool slightly for about 3 minutes. Cut diagonally into 1 to 2 inch strips while still warm. Remove individual cookies to cool on a wire rack.
