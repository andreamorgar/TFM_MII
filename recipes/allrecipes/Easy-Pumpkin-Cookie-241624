Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease baking sheets. Beat sugar, shortening, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until creamy. Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves together in another bowl. Add flour mixture to sugar mixture and stir until completely incorporated. Mix white chocolate chips and butterscotch chips into dough until evenly-combined. Drop dough by the teaspoonful onto prepared baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until set, 10 to 15 minutes.
