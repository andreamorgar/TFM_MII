Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a medium bowl, stir together the brownie mix and dry instant pudding. Add the oil and eggs; mix until well blended. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls. Place the cookies 2 inches apart onto the cookie sheet. Bake for 6 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until firm. I think they are best if removed when the middle is still soft. Cool on cookie sheets for 1 minute before removing to wire racks.
