In a lidded, plastic storage container stir butter until it has a smooth, frosting-like consistency. Slowly, one tablespoon at a time, stir in the first 1/2 cup of oil; mix until smooth. Stir in the remaining oil a little more quickly, mixing well. Refrigerate for 3 hours, or until set. Store in refrigerator. If the 'butter' melts after being left out, refrigerate to restore solidified quality.
