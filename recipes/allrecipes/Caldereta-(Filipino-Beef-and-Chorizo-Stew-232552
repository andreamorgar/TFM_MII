Combine beef chuck, chorizo, garlic, vinegar, and soy sauce in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until beef chuck is browned and liquid is reduced, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion and green bell pepper in the hot oil until onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add tomato sauce and simmer until liquid is slightly reduced, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir beef-chorizo mixture into tomato sauce mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover pot, and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes. Stir potatoes, peas, salt, and pepper into stew; simmer until beef is tender and potatoes are cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes. Add water if needed.
