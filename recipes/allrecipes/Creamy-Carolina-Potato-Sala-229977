Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain, cool, and chop potatoes into 1-inch cubes. Combine chopped potatoes and eggs in a large bowl. Mix sour cream, mayonnaise, pimento peppers, green onions, bacon, mustard, sugar, vinegar, salt, black pepper, celery seed, and garlic powder together in a bowl. Pour dressing over potatoes and eggs; toss gently to coat. Sprinkle potato salad with paprika.
