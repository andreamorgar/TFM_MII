Preheat waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Beat egg whites in a large bowl until fluffy. Fold in milk, butter, and honey. Add cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and salt, stirring slowly until batter is smooth. Fold in corn and green chile peppers. Scoop some batter onto waffle iron; cook until golden brown and crisp or until waffle iron stops steaming, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
