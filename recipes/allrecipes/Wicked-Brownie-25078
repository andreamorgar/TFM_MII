Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch pan. In medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Remove from heat and immediately stir in the cocoa. In a large bowl, beat together the sugar and eggs. Stir in the melted chocolate mixture. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; stir into the batter. Fold in walnuts if desired. Spread evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top has crusted over. You want the tester to come out a with a little batter on it, not completely clean. Cool for a few minutes before cutting into bars.
