Combine the oil, salt, pepper, thyme and garlic into a paste, then rub all over the roast. Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour. Forty minutes into the hour, pre-heat the oven to 500 degrees F. On a baking sheet, place two sheets of Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil large enough to cover the roast. Place the roast on the foil sheets and transfer everything to the oven. Roast for 6 minutes per pound. Remove from the oven. Fold up the foil so it wraps the roast then return it to the oven. Reduce the oven temperature to 170 degrees F and roast for one hour. After an hour, check the internal temperature with an instant-read thermometer: 120-125 degrees F will yield a rare center, 130-140 degrees F will yield a medium-rare center, and 140-150 degrees F will yield a medium center. When the roast is finished, remove it and set it on a cutting board to rest. Transfer any drippings from the roast into a saucepan, then combine with the red wine and beef broth. Bring to a simmer over med-high heat and reduce by 1/4; reduce heat to medium-low and whisk in the cubes of butter one at a time until incorporated into the sauce. Add salt and pepper to taste and set aside. Slice the roast into 1/2 inch thick slices and serve with the pan sauce poured on top.
