Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Press 1 package crescent rolls into prepared baking dish, pushing seams together. Layer ham, pepperoni, salami, Swiss cheese, and provolone cheese atop crescent rolls. Pour beaten eggs over meat and cheese layers, reserving about 1 tablespoon egg. Layer the second package of crescent rolls atop meat and cheese filling; brush with reserved egg. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and crescent rolls are browned. Cut into squares and serve.
