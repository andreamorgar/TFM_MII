Saute chicken sausage in canola oil over medium-high heat until browned, about 2 minutes. Set aside. Combine endive, gourmet salad greens, blueberries and chicken sausage in a large bowl. In a small bowl, combine vinegar, honey, salt, and pepper and stir with a whisk. Add dressing to endive mixture; toss gently. Sprinkle with cheese and pecans.
