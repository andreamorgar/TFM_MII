Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch tube pan. Mix apples, 5 tablespoons sugar, and 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon in a bowl and set aside. Beat the oil and 2 cups of sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl. Add the room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the sugar mixture before adding the next. Beat in the vanilla and 1/4 cup of orange juice with the last egg. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl and stir into the sugar mixture; mixing until just incorporated. Pour half of the batter into the prepared tube pan. Layer the apple mixture on top, then pour the remaining batter over the apples. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 25 minutes. Allow cake to cool completely in the pan before removing. To make glaze: Combine butter, 1/3 cup of orange juice, and 2/3 cup of sugar in a bowl. Pour over the warm cake while still in the pan.
