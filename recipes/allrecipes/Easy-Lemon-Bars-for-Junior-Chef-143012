Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine the angel food cake mix with the lemon pie filling in a mixing bowl; blend until smooth. Pour the batter into an ungreased 10x15 inch jelly roll pan. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown and top springs back when lightly touched, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pan, and cut into squares.
