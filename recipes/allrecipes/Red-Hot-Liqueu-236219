Pour red hot candies into a resealable plastic bag. Crush candies with a mallet or rolling pin. Transfer crushed candies to a food processor and pulse until candies form a fine powder. Stir candy powder and vodka together in a bowl. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let rest until powder is dissolved, at least 2 hours. Pour vodka mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl and discard any candy pieces that did not dissolve. Pour vodka into a bottle and seal.
