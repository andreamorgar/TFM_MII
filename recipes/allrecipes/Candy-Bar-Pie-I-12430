Cut candy bars in half lengthwise, then into 1/4 inch pieces. Place candy pieces over bottom of pie crust. In a small bowl, combine sugar and cream cheese; beat until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add sour cream and peanut butter; beat until mixture is smooth. Pour filling over candy pieces. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 30 to 40 minutes. In a small saucepan, heat whipping cream until very warm. Remove from heat, and stir in chocolate chips until smooth. Spread over top of pie. Refrigerate 2 to 3 hours before serving.
