Place bacon in a wok or large skillet; cook and stir over medium-high heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon and reserve bacon drippings in the wok. Cook and stir shallots in bacon drippings over medium-high heat until fragrant and light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir chicken into shallots and cook without stirring until browned on one side, 45 seconds to 1 minute; stir. Continue cooking until chicken is browned, about 1 minute. Add 2 teaspoons curry powder; stir until chicken is coated. Make a well in the center of chicken and pour oil into center of the well; add egg yolks. Cook and stir egg yolks until set, 1 to 2 minutes. Add rice and stir, breaking up rice. Mix chile pepper, cilantro, soy sauce, remaining 2 teaspoons curry powder, fish sauce, and sugar into rice mixture; add shrimp and cook until shrimp is cooked through and pink, about 2 minutes. Fold pineapple, green onions, and bacon into rice mixture.
