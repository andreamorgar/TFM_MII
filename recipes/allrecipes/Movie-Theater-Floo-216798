Mix popcorn, corn chips, candy corn, mixed nuts, and jelly beans together in a large bowl. In a microwave-safe glass bowl, melt the white chocolate chips on Low setting until barely melted, 1 or 2 minutes. Stir until smooth. Pour the white chocolate over the popcorn mixture, and stir to coat. Allow to cool, and break apart into small pieces.
