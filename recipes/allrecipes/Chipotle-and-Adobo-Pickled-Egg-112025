In a large pot, combine the vinegar, water, garlic, onion, salt, sugar, chipotle chiles and adobo sauce. Bring to a boil, and cook until the onion is translucent, about 15 minutes. Place the hard-cooked eggs into clean jars. Strain the boiling brine into the jars to cover the eggs. Cover with lids and refrigerate for at least 3 days before serving. Store in the refrigerator for up to 6 weeks.
