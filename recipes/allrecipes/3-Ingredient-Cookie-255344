Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mash bananas in a bowl with a fork until no lumps remain. Stir in oats and chocolate chips. Scoop small portions of batter onto a nonstick baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool for 2 to 5 minutes per serving.
