Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat brown sugar and eggs together in a bowl until smooth; add peanut butter and beat until well-combined. Stir flour, chocolate chips, and baking soda into peanut butter mixture until dough forms. Roll dough into balls, and place 2-inches apart on a baking sheet. Flatten dough balls with the back of a spoon. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 25 minutes.
