Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square cake pan or line with parchment paper. Process garbanzo beans in a food processor until smooth. Add cinnamon and cloves and pulse until combined. Add eggs, sugar, baking powder, and orange zest; process until just combined. Stir orange juice into garbanzo mixture. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Remove cake from pan and cool completely on a wire rack before cutting into squares.
