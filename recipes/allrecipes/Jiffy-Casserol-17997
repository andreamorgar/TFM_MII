Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat a large skillet over medium heat and pour in oil. Saute onion in oil until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Set aside. In the same skillet over medium heat, saute the ground beef for 5 to 10 minutes, or until browned. Place a layer of potatoes into a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste and then spread a layer of ground beef over the potatoes, followed by a layer of onions. Repeat layers, ending with potatoes. In a medium bowl, combine the soup with the water. Mix well and pour over the casserole mixture. Sprinkle with paprika to taste. Cover pan and bake in preheated oven for 1 hour.
