Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cream butter or margarine, sugar and vanilla until mixture is light and fluffy. Slowly blend in the flour. For each cookie, shape one level tablespoon of dough around a cherry. Form each cookie into a ball and place them on an ungreased cookie sheet 1 inch apart. Bake 12 to 15 minutes.
