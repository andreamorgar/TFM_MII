Combine heavy cream, sugar, and salt in a saucepan. Heat over medium heat until steaming, 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk egg yolks in a bowl. Whisk in 1 cup of the hot cream. Pour egg and cream mixture back into the saucepan; cook and stir until mixture coats the back of a spoon, about 4 minutes. Mix in banana and vanilla extract. Transfer mixture to the refrigerator; chill until very cold, at least 2 hours. Freeze cold mixture in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer to a freezer-safe container; fold in maraschino cherries, strawberry jam, and chocolate syrup. Freeze ice cream until firm, about 4 hours.
