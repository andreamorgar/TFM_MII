In a large bowl, combine dry milk, non-dairy creamer, confectioners' sugar, and instant chocolate drink mix. Mix well. Put in a large airtight container. Label and store in a cool dry place. Best if used within 6 months. To make Hot Chocolate, add 3 tablespoons mix to 1 cup of hot water, and stir well. Add mini marshmallows if desired.
