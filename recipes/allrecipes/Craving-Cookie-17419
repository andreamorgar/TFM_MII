In a medium bowl, stir together the mashed banana and peanut butter until well blended. Stir in the brown sugar, white sugar and vanilla until smooth. Combine the flour and baking powder; add to the peanut butter mixture and mix well. Finally, fold in the chocolate chips. Cover and chill dough for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper. Roll dough into walnut sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
