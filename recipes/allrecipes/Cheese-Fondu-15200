Rub the inside of the fondue pot (or a casserole/chafing dish) with a clove of garlic. If using a chafing dish, add just enough water to cover the bottom of the pan in order to protect it. Dredge the diced cheese in potato flour and set aside. Pour wine in the dish and heat. When the wine is heated, add the coated cheese. Bring to a slow simmer, stirring with a wire whisk until the cheese is melted and well-blended with the wine. Season with grated nutmeg, salt, and pepper. When ready to serve, whisk in kirsch. Serve with bread cubes.
