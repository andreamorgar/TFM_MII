Combine flour, salt, and butter in a food processor. Pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 10 1-second pulses. Stir water and vinegar in a small bowl. Pour half the ice water and vinegar mixture into the flour and butter mixture. Pulse to combine, about 3 (1-second) pulses. Pour in remaining ice water and vinegar mixture. Pulse until mixture just starts to come together, about 8 (1-second) pulses. Turn dough out onto a wooden surface, pat into round shape and divide in half. Form each half into a disc about 5 inches wide. Wrap each disc in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes until ready to use.
