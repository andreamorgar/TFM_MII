Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch springform pan with cooking spray. Mix flaked coconut, sugar, and flour together in a bowl. Mix in egg white until crust holds together. Press crust into the bottom of the greased pan. Bake crust in the preheated oven until pale, about 18 minutes. Let cool. Blend coconut yogurt, eggs, sugar, and coconut extract together in a bowl until smooth. Mix in cornstarch and salt. Pour filling over cooled crust. Bake in the preheated oven until edges start pulling away from the pan and center jiggles slightly when shaken, about 35 minutes. Let cool, about 30 minutes. Chill cheesecake in the refrigerator until firm, about 3 hours.
