Place cream cheese in a mixing bowl, and beat til light and fluffy. Add the rest of the ingredients, except for the fruit preserves, and form into a flat disk. Chill overnight. Roll dough out onto a lightly floured board, and cut circles using a medium sized glass. In the center of each circle, add 1/2 teaspoon of preserves; crimp edges tightly together. Natural preserves have a tendency to spill out due to the lower sugar content, but still make a great cookie. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 15 to 17 minutes.
