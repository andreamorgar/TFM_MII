Preheat the broiler. Arrange peach halves, cut-side up in a shallow baking dish. In a small dish, stir together the brown sugar, cinnamon, and chopped pecans. Sprinkle the mixture over the peaches. Broil 3 inches from heat for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the topping is browned. Serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
