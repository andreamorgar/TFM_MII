Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix brown sugar, butter, and egg in a bowl until well blended. Mix hemp seeds, flour, and cinnamon together in a separate bowl. Stir into the brown sugar mixture until dough comes together. Drop spoonfuls of dough onto the baking sheet; flatten with the back of the spoon. Bake cookies in the preheated oven until edges are crisp, 8 to 11 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool, 10 to 15 minutes.
