Place cashews in a bowl; fill with enough water to cover. Soak cashews, 4 hours or overnight. Drain and rinse cashews. Blend cashews and 3 cups water in a blender until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add dates, vanilla extract, pumpkin pie spice, ground nutmeg, ground clove, and Himalayan salt; blend to incorporate, 2 to 3 minutes more.
