In a large soup pot, cook chicken in water until the meat begins to fall off the bone. Skim fat off stock. Remove the chicken from pot, and set aside to cool. Add pasta to stock, and cook for about 10 minutes. Shut off heat. In a medium bowl, beat 2 eggs with the juice of 2 lemons until foamy. Whisk 1 cup stock slowly into the egg/lemon mixture. Repeat with another cup of stock, and pour mixture into soup. Bone chicken, and add meat to soup. Stir well. Add salt and pepper to taste.
