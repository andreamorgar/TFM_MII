Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken, celery, cashews, mayonnaise, onion, salt and lemon juice. Transfer the mixture to a casserole dish, then top with shredded cheese and potato chips. Bake uncovered for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until heated through and bubbly.
