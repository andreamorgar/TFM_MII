Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C.) In a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish, mix pears, cranberries, bananas, orange juice, sugar, salt and 1/8 teaspoon cloves. Mix lightly. In a small bowl, mix brown sugar, flour, oats, remaining 1/8 teaspoon cloves and orange rind. Cut in butter until crumbly. Sprinkle over fruit. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until top is golden brown. Serve at room temperature.
