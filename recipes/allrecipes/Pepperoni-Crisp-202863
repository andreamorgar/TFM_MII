Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Arrange pepperoni in a single layer on an ungreased baking sheet; sprinkle with Cajun seasoning. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove sheet from oven and pat away grease with paper towels. Return to oven and bake until crisp, 2 to 4 additional minutes. Drain on paper towels. Store cooled chips in an airtight container.
