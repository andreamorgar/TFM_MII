Bring water, rice, and sugar to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Mix cooked rice, sweetened condensed milk, and milk in a large bowl. Fill ice pop molds with mixture. Freeze until solid, at least 2 hours.
