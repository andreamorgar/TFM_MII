Whisk eggs in a bowl until pale yellow. Whisk buttermilk, vanilla, butter, and nutmeg into eggs until butter is reduced to small pieces. Stir flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into egg mixture until just moistened. Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-low heat. Drop batter by 1/2 cup portions onto the griddle, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 4 minutes. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
