Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan. In a large bowl, stir together the sugar, flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Make a well in the center, and pour in the oil, eggs and vanilla. Mix until well blended. Fold in the raisins and apples. Spread evenly in the prepared pan. Bake for 1 1/2 hours in the preheated oven, until firm and lightly browned.
