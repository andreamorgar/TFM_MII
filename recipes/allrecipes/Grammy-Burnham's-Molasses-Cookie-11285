Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease baking sheets. In a large bowl, cream together shortening and sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the molasses. Combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, allspice, and ginger; blend into the molasses mixture. Stir in raisins. Drop dough by tablespoonfuls onto prepared baking sheets. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in preheated oven, or until the center is set. Cool on wire racks.
