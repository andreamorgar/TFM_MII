Place potato into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, onion, red bell pepper, and garlic in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add potato, salsa, chili powder, cumin, seasoned salt, and pepper to ground beef mixture; cook and stir over low heat until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; crack eggs into the hot oil. Cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Place tostada shells on a serving plate; top each with beef-potato mixture. Layer 1 egg onto each tostada; sprinkle with cilantro.
