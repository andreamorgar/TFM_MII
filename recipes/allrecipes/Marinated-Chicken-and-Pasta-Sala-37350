In a large bowl, combine 3 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons honey, 2 tablespoons tomato sauce, 2 tablespoons plum sauce, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, sesame seeds, and basil. Add chicken, and turn to coat. Marinate in refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and rinse. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until no longer pink, and juices run clear. Drain on paper towels. Allow to cool, then cut into bite-size strips. In a large bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, sour cream, mustard, 1 tablespoon honey, 1 tablespoon tomato sauce, and 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce. Mix in cooked pasta, chicken, and Cheddar cheese. Gently stir in sliced avocado and cashews just before serving.
