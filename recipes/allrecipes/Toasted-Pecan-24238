Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Pour the butter into a medium bowl, and mix in the pecans. Stir until the pecans are well coated. Arrange coated pecans in a single layer on one or two medium baking sheets. Sprinkle with salt. Bake in the preheated oven approximately 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat, cool and store in covered containers.
