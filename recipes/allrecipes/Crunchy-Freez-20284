Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). In a large bowl, stir together butter, cereal, brown sugar, coconut and pecans. Spread on a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven 30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes. Let cool completely. In a 9x13 inch dish, place two-thirds of the cereal mixture. Spread softened ice cream over cereal. Top with remaining cereal. Cover tightly and freeze 8 hours or overnight.
