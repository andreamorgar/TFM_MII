In medium saucepan combine sugar, flour, and salt. Add eggs and stir well. Stir in milk, and cook over low heat, stirring constantly. When mixture begins to thicken, remove from heat and continue to stir, cooling slightly. Stir in vanilla and butter until smooth. Layer pudding with bananas and vanilla wafers in a serving dish. Chill at least one hour in refrigerator before serving.
