Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease pizza pan or baking sheet. Place whole bar of dough on prepared pan. Allow to soften for 5 to 10 minutes. Using fingertips, pat dough gently to form 8-inch circle. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Immediately sprinkle morsels over hot crust; drop peanut butter by spoonfuls onto morsels. Let stand for 5 minutes or until morsels become shiny. Gently spread chocolate and peanut butter evenly over cookie crust. Sprinkle candy in single layer over pizza. Let stand for 10 minutes. Cut into wedges; serve warm or at room temperature.
