Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a medium bowl, stir together chicken, cheese, onion, flour, and 1/4 cup pecans; spoon into pie crust. In another bowl, beat eggs with milk and mustard; pour over chicken. Top with remaining pecans. Bake in preheated oven for 50 minutes, or until done.
