Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Mix ingredients in order given, by hand (mixers ruin this recipe!). Mix in baking soda dissolved in water. Add the flour last. Lightly flour board, and add flour as needed to keep dough from being really sticky. Roll out thin and cut into any shapes you want. Bake 10 to 12 minutes.
