Blend sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, cream cheese, and lime juice in a blender until sauce is creamy. Pour sauce into a bowl. Dip enough Maria cookies to cover the bottom of a 9x13-inch glass baking dish in the creamy lime sauce. Spread a layer of fruit cocktail over the cookies. Dip and layer a second layer of Maria cookies over the fruit cocktail. Continue dipping and layering cookies and fruit cocktail until the last layer of cookies is about 1 inch from the top of pan. Spread peaches over the dessert. Cover dessert with plastic wrap and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight before serving.
