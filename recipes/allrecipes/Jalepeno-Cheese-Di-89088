Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a bowl, mix the cheese, mayonnaise, garlic, olives, and 1 jalapeno. Spread the mixture into an 8x8 inch baking pan. Season with garlic salt, and sprinkle with remaining jalapeno. Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges are golden brown.
