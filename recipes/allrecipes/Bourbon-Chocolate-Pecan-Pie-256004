Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spread pecan halves on a baking sheet. Toast pecans in the preheating oven, stirring occasionally, until golden and fragrant, 6 to 10 minutes. Chop coarsely. Whisk corn syrup, sugar, eggs, melted butter, bourbon, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir pecans, dark chocolate chips, milk chocolate chips, and white chocolate chips into the filling. Line a 9-inch fluted glass pie plate with pie crust. Brush milk over crust. Bake pie crust in the preheated oven until hot to the touch, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour filling into the hot crust. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are firm and center is mostly set, about 45 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack; cool for at least 1 hour before serving.
