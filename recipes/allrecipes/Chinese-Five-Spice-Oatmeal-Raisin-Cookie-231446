Soak raisins in a bowl of warm water until plump, about 30 minutes. Drain and pat raisins dry with a towel. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat butter and both sugars with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat the first egg into the butter until completely blended; beat vanilla extract in with the second egg. Combine oats, flour, walnuts, coconut, five-spice powder, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl. Stir egg mixture into oat mixture until well mixed. Fold in raisins and mix until just incorporated. Drop rounded spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
