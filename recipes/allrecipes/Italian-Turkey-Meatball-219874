Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Combine all the ingredients together except for the Melt(R); stir well in a bowl. Form around 30 balls out of the mixture. Put them on a broiler pan coated with the melted Melt. Bake around 15 minutes or until a cut meatball shows no pink inside. Serve with pasta and sauce or place on a sandwich.
