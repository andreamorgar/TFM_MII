Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat sugar, eggs, butter, cornmeal, flour, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl until smooth; add pineapple, pecans, and coconut and stir. Pour the filling into the prepared pie crust. Bake in preheated oven until the center of the pie is nearly set, 50 to 60 minutes.
