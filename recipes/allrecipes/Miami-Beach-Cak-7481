Gradually add 1 1/2 cups sugar, and beat until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Blend in melted chocolate and vanilla extract. Combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. Add these dry ingredients alternately with buttermilk to the creamed mixture, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. Mix well after each addition. Pour batter into greased pans. Sprinkle with coconut mixture. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until cake springs back when touched lightly in center. Cool cake on wire racks.
