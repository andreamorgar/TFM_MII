Warm the wine and oil over medium heat. Remove from heat and add 12 cups of flour. Stir in water, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough comes together in a soft ball. Knead well. Roll the dough into a snake and cut into two inch pieces. Run each piece over a basket or use a fork to get ridges in the dough. Heat oil for frying in a large pot. Deep fry cookies until medium brown. Drain on paper towels. Warm honey in a frying pan until very liquid. Roll the cookies in the honey, and then place in a dish. Allow the honey to cool and serve.
