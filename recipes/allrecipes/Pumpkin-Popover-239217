Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter 4 custard dishes or muffin cups. Beat milk and eggs together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth; mix in pumpkin and oil. Beat flour, brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice, and salt into pumpkin mixture until batter is smooth. Pour batter into the prepared custard cups, filling each halfway. Bake in the preheated oven until tops are lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
