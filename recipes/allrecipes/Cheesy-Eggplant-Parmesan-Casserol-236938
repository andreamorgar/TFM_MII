Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Brush about 2 tablespoons olive oil onto eggplant slices; arrange in a single layer in a shallow baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until eggplant is tender and browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove eggplant from oven and reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet or frying pan over medium heat; cook and stir onion, mushrooms, and garlic until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add tomato sauce, basil, and oregano; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until sauce is slightly reduced, about 10 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Arrange about 1/2 the eggplant slices in a 2-quart casserole dish; top with 1/2 the sauce, 1/2 the mozzarella cheese, and 1/2 the Parmesan cheese. Repeat layering with the remaining ingredients. Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbling, about 25 minutes. Cool for about 5 minutes before serving.
