Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove from heat and allow the mixture to cool. In a small bowl, dissolve the gelatin in water. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, mix the pumpkin, eggs, milk, sugar, salt and cinnamon. Reserve the egg whites. Stirring constantly, cook until thick, about 4 minutes.

Gently fold the egg whites into the cooled pumpkin mixture. Pour the pumpkin mixture over the cream cheese mixture. Top with whipped cream. Cover and refrigerate approximately 2 hours.
