Place the carrots and water into a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Boil until tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly, then puree carrots and water in a blender. In a large pot, heat the milk over medium heat. Stir in the carrots, sugar and cardamom until sugar has dissolved. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours. Shake or stir before serving.
