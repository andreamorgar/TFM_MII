Prepare the 9 inch cake pan by rubbing the inside well with a drop of cooking oil and then scattering a little flour over it. Preheat oven to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C). Separate the eggs and beat the yolks into the sugar thoroughly. Add lemon juice and grated rind, carrots, almonds, flour, baking powder and salt. Mix well. Beat egg whites until stiff and fold into cake mixture. Pour batter into 9 inch cake pan. Bake at 360 degrees F (180 degrees C) for 45 minutes. This cake is often iced with 3/4 cup confectioners sugar into which is beaten 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Little marzipan carrots are the traditional decoration.
