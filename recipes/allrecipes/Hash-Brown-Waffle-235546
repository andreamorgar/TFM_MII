Preheat waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Spray waffle iron with cooking spray. Place shredded potatoes in a bowl. Pour enough cold water over potatoes to cover; soak for 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and rinse to remove starch. Squeeze water out of potatoes by hand or by rolling in a clean kitchen towel and twisting towel to wring out water. Toss potatoes with oil, garlic, salt, pepper, and paprika in a bowl until evenly coated. Stir eggs into potato mixture. Spoon half the potato mixture into preheated waffle iron; cook until potatoes are tender and golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Repeat with remaining potato mixture.
