Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large bowl, cream together 1/4 cup butter and 1/3 cup of sugar until smooth. Beat in egg and vanilla until well blended. Combine 1 1/2 cups of flour, salt and baking powder; stir into the creamed mixture alternately with the milk. Spread evenly in a 9x9 inch baking pan. In a small bowl, stir together 2 tablespoons flour, 5 tablespoons sugar, and cinnamon. Add 2 tablespoons of butter, and pinch into the dry mixture using your fingers until the mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle over the top of the cake. Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.
