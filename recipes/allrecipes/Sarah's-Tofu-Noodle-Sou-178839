Melt the butter in a stockpot over medium heat. Stir in the carrots, onion, celery, and garlic and cook until just tender, about 10 minutes. Pour in the broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, add the noodles, tofu, raisins, basil, oregano, poultry seasoning, thyme, rosemary, marjoram, and pepper. Dissolve the cornstarch and water in a small bowl. Stir the cornstarch mixture into the soup. Return soup to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.
