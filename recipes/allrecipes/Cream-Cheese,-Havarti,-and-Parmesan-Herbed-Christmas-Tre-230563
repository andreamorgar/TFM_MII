Mix cream cheese, Havarti cheese, Parmesan cheese, 2 tablespoons basil, lemon zest, and garlic together in a bowl. Transfer cream cheese mixture to a piece of plastic wrap. Roll the plastic wrap around cream cheese mixture forming a cone shape, resembling a tree. Stand the 'tree' upright and remove the plastic wrap. Cover the visible portion of the 'tree' with 1/4 cup basil and parsley. Gently wrap the 'tree' with a fresh sheet of plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.
