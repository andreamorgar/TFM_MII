In a small skillet, stir together Stevia In The Raw and 1 teaspoon water to dissolve stevia. Add butter and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until deep brown bits form on the bottom of the pan. Remove from heat and stir in cream, pumpkin, vanilla, salt, and spice. Heat milk until steaming, then add coffee and pumpkin caramel mixture, and stir to combine. If desired, top with whipped cream and sprinkle with pumpkin pie spice.
