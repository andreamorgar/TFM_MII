Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil and add potatoes. Boil until potatoes are tender, 10 to 13 minutes; drain. Let cool until potatoes are warm. Whisk yogurt, sour cream, lemon zest, lemon juice, mustard, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Gently fold potatoes into dressing. Stir arugula leaves into potato mixture and serve.
