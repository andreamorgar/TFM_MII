Place melted white chocolate in a large bowl and stir in peanut butter until well combined. Pour mixture into the prepared baking dish and smooth the top with a spatula. Melt dark chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Drizzle melted dark chocolate over the white chocolate-peanut butter mixture in stripes. Use a butter knife to make a marble pattern.
