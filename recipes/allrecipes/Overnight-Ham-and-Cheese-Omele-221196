Butter bottom and sides of a shallow roasting dish. Layer bread, Cheddar cheese, and ham in prepared roasting dish. Beat milk, eggs, thyme, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Pour egg mixture over bread mixture; cover and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake uncovered egg mixture in the preheated oven until center is set, about 1 hour. Allow to sit and cool for 15 minutes before serving.
