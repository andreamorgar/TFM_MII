Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a mixing bowl, beat eggs with an electric mixer. Add 1 cup sugar and beat well. Blend in nuts, dates, vanilla, coconut and almond extract. Transfer mixture to an ungreased 2 quart casserole. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 30 minutes. Remove the mixture from the oven while still hot and beat well with a wooden spoon. Cool until the mixture can be handled then form into small balls and roll in the 1/4 cup remaining sugar.
