Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch cake pans with cooking spray. Combine strawberry cake mix, white chocolate chips, sour cream, vegetable oil, eggs, water, and pudding mix in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Divide batter between the prepared cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. Set pans on a wire rack and cool for 15 minutes.
