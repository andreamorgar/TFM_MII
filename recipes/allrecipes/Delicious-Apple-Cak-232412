Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking dish. Whisk sugar into vegetable oil in a mixing bowl. Beat eggs, vanilla extract, salt, flour, and baking soda into the sugar mixture, one ingredient at a time, in that order. Fold apple slices into the batter; pour into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.
