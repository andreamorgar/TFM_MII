Place green onions, ginger, and garlic in a food processor; puree until smooth. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season chicken thighs with salt and cook, skin-side down, until browned, about 10 minutes per side. Remove from skillet. Scrape ginger puree into the skillet and cook, stirring constantly, 2 to 3 minutes. Add curry powder, red curry paste, garam masala, and Chinese five-spice powder; cook and stir until fragrant. Pour in coconut milk and stir to loosen up the bits from the bottom of the skillet. Add fish sauce and half the sugar. Taste; adjust salt and sugar, and stir in sriracha sauce. Return chicken thighs to the skillet, reduce heat, and simmer until flavors are combined, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
