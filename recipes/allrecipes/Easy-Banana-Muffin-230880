Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 16 muffin cups with cooking spray. Sift all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Mix bananas, white sugar, canola oil, brown sugar, and egg together in a separate large bowl; fold banana mixture into flour mixture until just incorporated. Scoop batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until muffins spring back when lightly tapped in the middle, 14 to 16 minutes.
