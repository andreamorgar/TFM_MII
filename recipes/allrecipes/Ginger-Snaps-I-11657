In a medium bowl, cream the butter and sugar together. Add the honey and egg, mix until creamy. Sift together the flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves; stir into the creamed mixture. Roll into a log about 1 inch in diameter. Wrap in wax paper, and refrigerate overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Slice the log into 1/4 inch round slices. Place them 2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow to cool on the baking sheets before removing.
