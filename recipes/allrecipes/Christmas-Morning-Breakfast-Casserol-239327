Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Prepare Idahoan Steakhouse Cheesy Hashbrown Potatoes, following packaging directions, replacing the 1/2 cup milk with 1/2 cup buttermilk. In a medium size skillet, cook bacon and onion until bacon is crisp. Drain and set aside to cool slightly. Stir in eggs, Swiss cheese, and bacon-onion mixture. Bake uncovered for 25 minutes. Sprinkle crunchy onion topping on top of potatoes. Let stand 5 minutes then serve.
