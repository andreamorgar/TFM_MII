Combine first 5 ingredients in heavy large saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat until mixture thickens and rice is very tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. Reduce heat to low. Whisk egg yolks and cream in small bowl. Gradually whisk in 1/2 cup rice mixture; return to same pan and cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly (do not boil). Remove from heat. Add chocolate; stir until melted. Stir in orange peel and cardamom. Transfer pudding to bowl; cover and chill until cold. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.) Spoon pudding into bowls. Top with Dried Cranberry Compote.
