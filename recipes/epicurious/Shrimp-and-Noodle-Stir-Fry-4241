Soak noodles in cold water to cover 15 minutes. Drain and cut in half with scissors. Heat a wok or large heavy skillet over high heat until a bead of water dropped on cooking surface evaporates immediately. Swirl 1 tablespoon peanut oil in wok to coat evenly and heat until just smoking. Stir-fry onion, ginger, and red pepper flakes 1 minute. Add mushrooms and stir-fry until just tender, about 2 minutes. Transfer mixture to a large bowl and season with salt. Swirl another tablespoon peanut oil in wok to coat evenly and heat until just smoking. Stir-fry bok choy until barely tender, then add scallions and salt to taste and stir-fry until bok choy is crisp-tender. Add to mushroom mixture. Pat shrimp dry and season with salt. Swirl remaining tablespoon peanut oil in wok and heat until just smoking. Stir-fry shrimp 2 minutes, or until just cooked through, and transfer to bowl with vegetables. Add broth and garlic to wok and bring to a boil. Stir noodles into broth and boil until tender and most of broth is absorbed, 4 to 5 minutes. Return shrimp and vegetables to wok and stir-fry until heated. Stir in sesame oil, jícama, and salt to taste. Serve stir-fry sprinkled with cilantro leaves.
