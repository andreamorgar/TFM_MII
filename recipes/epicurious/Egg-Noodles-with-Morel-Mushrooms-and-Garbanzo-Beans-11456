Bring broth and mushrooms to simmer in heavy small saucepan. Remove from heat; let stand until mushrooms soften, about 12 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer mushrooms to small bowl; reserve soaking liquid in pan. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic; stir 30 seconds. Add mushrooms and reserved soaking liquid, leaving any sediment in pan. Add wine and garbanzo beans. Boil until mushrooms are tender and sauce is reduced by half, about 8 minutes. Add noodles, 1/2 cup cheese and thyme to sauce. Toss until sauce coats noodles, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve with remaining cheese.
