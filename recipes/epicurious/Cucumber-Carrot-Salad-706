In a bowl stir together garlic paste, lime juice, fish sauce, sugar, and chili until sugar is dissolved. Thinly slice cucumbers crosswise and add to garlic mixture with carrot. Toss salad well. Salad may be made 4 hours ahead and kept chilled, covered, but cucumber will wilt and give off liquid. Serve salad in lettuce "cups."
