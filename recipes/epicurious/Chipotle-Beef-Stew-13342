Pat beef dry and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then brown meat in 2 batches, transferring to a plate as browned. Return all meat to skillet. Add onion, garlic, and cumin and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Pur e tomatoes with juice, chiles, adobo sauce, and water in a blender or food processor and add to meat mixture. Simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender, about 1 1/4 hours. Add hominy and simmer, covered, 15 minutes. Season with salt.
