Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly butter six 3/4-cup soufflé dishes or custard cups. Place on baking sheet. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add shallots; sauté until beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. Add cream, thyme, and bay leaf; increase heat to medium. Simmer 3 minutes. Add potatoes; simmer until partially cooked and mixture is thick and creamy, about 4 minutes. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle diced apple over bottom of prepared soufflé dishes, dividing equally. Spoon potato mixture over. Cover dishes tightly with foil. Bake until potato mixture and apples are tender, about 30 minutes (tops will not be brown). Remove from oven; let stand 10 minutes. Uncover; sprinkle with chives and serve.
