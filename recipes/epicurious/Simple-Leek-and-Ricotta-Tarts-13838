Preheat the oven to 180°C (355°F). Place the ricotta, parmesan and eggs in a bowl and whisk until smooth. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface until 3 mm (1/8 inch) thick. Cut into 4 x 15 cm (6 inch) squares and place on baking trays lined with non-stick baking paper. Spread the ricotta mixture over the pastry squares leaving a 2 cm (3/4 inch) border. Place the leek on top of the ricotta mixture and brush with the butter. Sprinkle with the thyme, salt, and pepper and bake for 25–30 minutes or until the leek is golden. Serve with the fennel and parsley salad .
