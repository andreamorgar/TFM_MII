Cut squash in half lengthwise and remove seeds. Prick rind with a fork. Place cut side down in a baking dish and add 1/4 inch water. Microwave squash on high 10 minutes, checking for doneness. (To bake: Preheat oven to 350°F. Place cut side down on a baking sheet. Bake until soft, about 1 hour.) Remove and cool. Scoop out flesh and place in a medium-sized bowl. Mix with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Heat oil in a medium-sized pot over medium heat and sauté onions until light brown. Remove from heat and cool. Season with salt. In a separate bowl, mix cheeses. Make crust. While second side of each crust is grilling, spread 1/8 cheese mixture over cooked side of each crust and top with onions. Top with dollops of squash; sprinkle with parsley. Rotate 3 to 4 minutes until bottom is golden brown.
