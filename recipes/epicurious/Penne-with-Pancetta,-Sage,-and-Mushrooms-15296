Bring broth and wine to a boil in a medium heavy saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until reduced to 1 cup, 15-18 minutes. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms; season with salt and pepper. Sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer mushrooms to a plate. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and pancetta to same skillet. Sauté until pancetta begins to brown, about 10 minutes. Add wine reduction, butter, and herbs; simmer until liquid thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Stir in mushrooms. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until almost tender but still firm to the bite. Drain pasta, reserving 1/2 cup cooking liquid. Stir pasta and 1/2 cup cheese into mushroom mixture. Stir over medium-high heat, adding water by tablespoonfuls if dry, until pasta is al dente and sauce thickens and clings to pasta, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a large bowl. Sprinkle 1/2 cup cheese over.
