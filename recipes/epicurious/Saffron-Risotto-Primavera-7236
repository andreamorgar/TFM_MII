Bring vegetable broth to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Add asparagus pieces and cook until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer asparagus to bowl. Add white wine and saffron threads to vegetable broth and bring to simmer. Heat olive oil in another heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add rice and stir until translucent, about 2 minutes. Mix in all but 1/4 cup broth mixture. Simmer rice uncovered until tender and creamy but still slightly firm to bite, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Mix in peas, then asparagus and Parmesan cheese. Add remaining 1/4 cup broth if risotto seems dry. Season with salt and pepper.
