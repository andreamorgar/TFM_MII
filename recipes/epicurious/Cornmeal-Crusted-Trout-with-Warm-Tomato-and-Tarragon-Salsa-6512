Heat 2 tablespoons oil in each of 2 heavy large skillets over medium-high heat. Add 2 trout to each skillet and cook until trout are opaque in center and crisp on outside, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer trout to plates. Wipe out 1 skillet, then heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic, and serrano chili.

Season salsa to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon salsa over trout. Sprinkle with pumpkin seeds and serve. *Ancho chili powder is available in the spice section of most supermarkets.
