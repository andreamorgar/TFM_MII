1. Rinse the fish inside and out with 1/4 cup of wine. 2. Select a round or oval platter that's large enough to hold the fish but will fit inside the top of a steaming utensil. This could be a traditional Chinese bamboo or metal steamer, or a Western-style clam steamer. 3. Place the fish on the platter and set platter in the top of the steamer. Cover and steam over boiling water 10 to 15 minutes. 4. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce base by combining the 2 tablespoons of wine, garlic, scallions, ginger, and sugar in a small bowl. 5. Check fish for doneness. When cooked, the flesh will be white and pull easily from the bones. Remove the platter and pour off the liquid that has accumulated around the fish. 6. Heat the oil in a wok or saucepan, and when it is hot, add the sauce base. Cook, stirring until the sauce boils. 7. Pour soy sauce over the sea bass first, and then pour the boiled sauce over the fish. Serve immediately.
