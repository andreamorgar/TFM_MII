Rinse the rice in a colander under cold, running water until the water runs clear. Drain. Place the rice, oil, salt, and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Allow the rice to boil, uncovered, until almost all of the water has evaporated, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir the rice, cover, and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and fluff with a fork just before serving.
