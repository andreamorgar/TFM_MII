Cut 1/4-inch slice off 1 long side of carrot to stabilize. Cut lengthwise into 1/8-inch-thick slices. Stack half of slices and cut lengthwise into 1/8-inch-thick strips. Cut strips crosswise into 1/8-inch cubes. Repeat with remaining slices. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add asparagus, zucchini, and crookneck squash; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Sauté until vegetables begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Set vegetables aside. Bring broth to simmer in medium saucepan over low heat. Cover and keep warm. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and cubed carrot. Sauté until onion begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Add rice; stir until rice is translucent at edges but still opaque in center, about 3 minutes. Add wine and simmer until absorbed, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. Add 1 cup warm broth and baby carrots. Simmer until broth is almost absorbed, stirring often, about 4 minutes. Add 2 cups more broth, 1 cup at a time, allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding next and stirring frequently, about 10 minutes. Mix in sautéed vegetables and 1 cup broth. Simmer until broth is just absorbed, stirring often, about 5 minutes. Add 1 1/3 cups cheese, peas, butter, and 1/2 cup broth. Simmer until butter melts, rice and vegetables are just tender, and risotto is creamy, stirring often and adding more broth by 1/4 cupfuls if risotto is dry, about 3 minutes longer. Mix in basil; season with salt and pepper. Transfer risotto to large shallow bowl. Sprinkle with pine nuts. Serve, passing additional cheese separately.
