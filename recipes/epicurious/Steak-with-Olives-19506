Heat a dry 12-inch heavy skillet (not nonstick) over medium-high heat until hot. Pat steak dry and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, then sear, without turning, 5 minutes (reduce heat if necessary to prevent scorching). Turn steak over and cook 5 to 6 minutes more for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board and let stand 5 minutes. Wipe out skillet, then cook garlic with red-pepper flakes in oil over medium heat, stirring, until golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Add olives and cook, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in parsley just before serving. Slice steak and serve with olive sauce.
