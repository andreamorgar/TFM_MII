With sharp knife cut peel and pith from oranges and cut sections free from membranes. Before discarding membranes squeeze out juice to total 1/4 cup for vinaigrette. In a small bowl whisk together orange juice, garlic, soy sauce, and vinegar. Add oil in a stream, whisking until emulsified, and season with salt and pepper. Vinaigrette may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Discard any dark green outer leaves from frisée. Wash and dry inner leaves and tear into bite-size pieces. Discard course stems from watercress and wash and dry remainder. Peel jícama and cut into 2-by 1/8-inch sticks (you should have about 1 cup). In a large sealable plastic bag combine orange sections, frisée, watercress, and jícama. Salad may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled in plastic bag. Just before serving, add vinaigrette to plastic bag and shake to combine.
