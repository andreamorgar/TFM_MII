Drain onions; soak in cold water about 1 hour. Change water; soak another hour and drain thoroughly. Shake beef with pepper, rosemary, garlic and salt in a resealable plastic bag to coat. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large skillet over high heat. Sear beef until all sides are brown and insides are rare, 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside. Heat remaining oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook onions about 4 minutes, stirring. Add salt and pepper. Remove from heat. Put 1 onion and 1 beef cube on each skewer. If needed, warm at 300°F for 4 minutes before serving.
