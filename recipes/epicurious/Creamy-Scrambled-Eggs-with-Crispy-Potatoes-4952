In a large skillet heat the oil over high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it fry the potato, rinsed, drained, and patted dry, stirring, for 6 minutes, or until it is crisp and golden. Transfer the potato with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and sprinkle with salt to taste. In a bowl whisk together the eggs and the cream. In a skillet melt the butter over moderately low heat and in it cook the eggs, stirring, until they are barely set. Stir in the potatoes, cook the mixture, stirring, until the eggs are set, and add the salt and pepper to taste. Divide the egg mixture between 2 heated plates and serve it with toast.
