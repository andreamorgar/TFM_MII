Cut six circular slices from the center of the honeydew; peel them and make melon balls from the remainder. Scoop balls from the cantaloupe. Stem the grapes. Lay the honeydew rings upon the leaves of Bibb lettuce; pile the other fruits in a ring and decorate with mint springs. Pass Celery Seed Dressing in a separate bowl. Accompany this salad with cream cheese balls rolled in ground nuts, and blueberry muffins.
