In a bowl cream together the cream cheese and the butter, add the paprika, the capers, the anchovies, the shallot, the caraway seeds, and salt and pepper to taste, and combine the mixture well. Pack the cheese into a crock and chill it, covered, for 1 day to let the flavors develop. Serve the cheese with the crackers.
