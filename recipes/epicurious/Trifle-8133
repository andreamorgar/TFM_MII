Line a decorative serving dish with the lady fingers or cake and pour over them the sherry. The cake should be moistened but not soaked. Add more sherry if necessary. Chill in the refrigerator. Make a pastry cream by blending the egg yolks, milk, and sugar and cooking in the top of a double boiler over hot (not boiling) water, stirring constantly. As soon as the mixture begins to thicken and slightly coats the spoon, pour into a bowl to cool. Do not overcook or it will curdle. Pour the cooled pastry cream over the cake and refrigerate until firm. To serve, cover top with a layer of whipped cream and decorate with cherries, peel, and nuts. Serve well chilled. If you prefer a less rich pastry cream, blend 3 egg yolks with 1/2 cup sugar, a pinch of salt, 2 tablespoons flour, and 2 teaspoons corn starch. Put in the top of a double boiler over hot water and add 1 cup light cream. Stir and cook until the pastry cream is thickened.
