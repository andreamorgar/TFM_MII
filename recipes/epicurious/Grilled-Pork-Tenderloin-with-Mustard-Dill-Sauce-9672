Whisk vinegar, 2 tablespoons dill, 2 teaspoons salt, and 2 tablespoons water in medium bowl until salt dissolves. Add zucchini. Let marinate 10 minutes, tossing often. Drain zucchini. Meanwhile, whisk 1/2 cup chopped dill, dijon mustard, honey, and 1/2 cup water in medium bowl. Season mustard-dill sauce with salt and pepper. Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper; spread with 2 tablespoons mustard-dill sauce. Grill until thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 145°F, turning often, about 25 minutes. Transfer to platter; let rest 10 minutes. Cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Serve with remaining sauce and pickles.
