Bring apples, brandy, and sugar to a boil in a 3-quart heavy saucepan, stirring, then boil until liquid is reduced to about 1/4 cup, about 12 minutes. Stir in blackberries and remove from heat. Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 500°F. Pat chops dry, then stir together rosemary, salt, and cracked pepper and rub all over chops. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) over moderately high heat, then sauté 4 chops, turning over once, until well browned, about 4 minutes total. Transfer to a shallow baking pan. Cook remaining 4 chops in remaining tablespoon oil in same manner. Roast chops in oven until medium-rare, about 3 minutes. Let chops stand, loosely covered with foil, 5 minutes. While chops stand, reheat compote over moderately low heat, gently stirring occasionally, until hot, then gently stir in butter, mint, and salt and pepper to taste. Serve chops with compote. *Available at some specialty foods shops and D'Artagnan (800-327-8246).
