Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in an ovenproof heavy medium skillet over medium heat until it shimmers. Cook fish, coated side down, until coconut is pale golden, 30 to 60 seconds. Carefully turn fish over and transfer skillet to oven. Roast until fish is just cooked through, 6 to 7 minutes. Serve fish with sauce.◊
