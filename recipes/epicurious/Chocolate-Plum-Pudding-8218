Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease 9x9-inch baking pan. Mix first 3 ingredients in small bowl. Stir prunes, sugar, eggs, chocolate, oil and vanilla to blend in large bowl. Mix in flour mixture. Transfer to prepared pan. Bake until pudding is set and slightly puffed at edges, about 25 minutes. Immediately cover with foil and refrigerate overnight. Cut into 16 squares and serve.
