In a large serving bowl, combine mesclun and dried cherries. Crumble goat cheese on top and sprinkle with pepper. In a large skillet cook pancetta in oil over moderate heat, stirring, until lightly browned. Pour off about 3 tablespoons (about 1/3 cup should be left in skillet with pancetta). Add garlic and sauté mixture, stirring, until garlic is golden. Carefully add thyme and vinegar. Increase heat to moderately high and boil mixture 1 minute. Add hot vinaigrette to salad and toss. Serve salad immediately.
