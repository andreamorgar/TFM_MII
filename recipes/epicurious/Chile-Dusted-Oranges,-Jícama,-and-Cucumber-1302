Cut off peel and white pith from 3 oranges with a sharp knife. Cut peeled fruit in half lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Cut remaining orange in half crosswise, then cut each half into 6 to 8 wedges for squeezing. Cut jicama wedges and cucumber crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Squeeze juice from 4 to 6 orange wedges into a bowl, then add jicama, cucumber, and salt to taste and toss well. Season orange slices with salt and arrange on a platter with jicama and cucumber. Lightly sprinkle with cayenne. Serve with remaining orange wedges.
