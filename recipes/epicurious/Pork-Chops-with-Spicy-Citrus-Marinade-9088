In a shallow baking dish whisk together orange juice, black pepper, chili powder, paprika, cayenne, and salt to taste. Add pork to marinade, turning to coat, and marinate at room temperature 20 minutes. In a non-stick skillet cook pork in marinade, covered, over moderately high heat 6 minutes on each side, or until just cooked through. Sprinkle pork with coriander.
