Bring water, sugar, vanilla bean and 2 bunches mint to boil in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Cook until reduced to 3/4 cup, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes. Strain into small bowl. Add extract. Cool. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.) Combine fruits in medium bowl. Pour over enough syrup to coat well. Let stand 15 minutes. Garnish with mint.
