Finely grate 3 tablespoons lemon zest using small holes of a box grater, then squeeze 3/4 cup juice from lemons. Transfer zest and juice to a large bowl and add vinegar, oil, sugar, red-pepper flakes, 2 tablespoons kosher salt, 2 tablespoons pickling spices, 1 tablespoon fennel seeds, and two thirds of garlic, whisking until combined well. Bring a 6- to 8-quart pot of water to a boil with remaining 2 tablespoons kosher salt, 2 tablespoons pickling spices, 1 tablespoon fennel seeds, remaining one third of garlic, and bay leaves. Meanwhile, quarter fennel bulb lengthwise and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Add sliced fennel to boiling water and cook, stirring occasionally, 3 minutes, then transfer with a slotted spoon to marinade. Return water to a boil, then add celery and cook, stirring occasionally, 1 minute. Transfer celery with a slotted spoon to marinade. Return water to a boil, then add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes. Transfer onion with a slotted spoon to marinade. Return water to a boil and cook shrimp, stirring occasionally, until just cooked through (no longer translucent inside), about 1 1/2 minutes, then transfer with a slotted spoon to marinade. Stir shrimp and vegetables until coated well. When shrimp and vegetables have cooled to room temperature, transfer to a large airtight container and marinate, chilled, stirring once or twice, until shrimp is pickled and flavors have developed, at least 8 hours. Season with salt and pepper and transfer shrimp and vegetables to a platter with a slotted spoon and drizzle shrimp with some of marinade. Stir in parsley just before serving.
