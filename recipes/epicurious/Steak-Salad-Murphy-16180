In a small bowl whisk together vinegar, honey, soy sauce, and garlic paste. Whisk in oil until dressing is emulsified. In a saucepan of boiling salted water blanch snow peas 30 seconds, or just until crisp-tender. Drain snow peas in a colander and rinse under cold water, draining well. In a serving bowl combine snow peas, onion, tomatoes, watercress, and steak. Add dressing and toss gently to combine.
