Combine first 6 ingredients in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugars dissolve. Boil gently until reduced to 1 cup, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes. Cool to lukewarm. Discard ginger pieces and add minced ginger. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and store at room temperature. Reheat to lukewarm, whisking occasionally, before serving.) Scoop ice cream into balloon glasses or sundae dishes. Spoon lukewarm sauce over. Top with fruit. Sprinkle with coconut and serve.
