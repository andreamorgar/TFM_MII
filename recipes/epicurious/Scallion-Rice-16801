In a large saucepan bring 4 quarts water to a boil with the salt. Sprinkle in the rice, stirring until the water returns to a boil, and boil it for 10 minutes. Drain the rice in a large colander and rinse it. Set the colander over a large saucepan of boiling water and steam the rice, covered with a kitchen towel and the lid, for 15 minutes, or until it is fluffy and dry. In a small skillet cook the white part of the scallion in the butter over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until it is softened and in a bowl toss the rice with the scallion mixture, the scallion greens, and salt and pepper to taste.
