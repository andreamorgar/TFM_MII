Heat the oil in a large shallow saucepan over medium heat. Add the potatoes, onions, and beef and sauté for 5 minutes. Stir in the dashi, sugar, sake, soy sauce, and mirin. Reduce the heat to low and cook the mixture, partially covered, for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are falling apart and melting into the syrupy sauce.
