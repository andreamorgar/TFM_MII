Cut asparagus on a diagonal into 1/8-inch-thick slices. Bring oil, lemon zest, juice, salt, and pepper to a simmer in a 4-quart heavy saucepan, then stir in beans and asparagus. Remove from heat and let stand, uncovered, 10 minutes. While beans stand, toast bread until golden. Meanwhile, remove enough cheese from piece with a vegetable peeler to measure about 1/2 cup shavings. Add shavings to beans along with parsley, then toss. Spread hot toast with butter and rub buttered side of each with cut side of garlic clove, then season with salt and halve. Serve bean salad with toasts.
