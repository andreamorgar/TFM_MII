Adjust fluted blade of mandoline to an opening of slightly more than 1/8 inch. Peel sweet potatoes, then slice crosswise on mandoline, turning each potato at a 90-degree angle after each slice to produce a waffle pattern. (It may take a few tries to get the pattern right.) Heat oil in a 4-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat until it registers 300°F on thermometer. Fry potatoes, 6 to 8 slices at a time, stirring and turning them frequently, until golden and crisp, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and return oil to 300°F between batches. Season gaufrettes lightly with salt while still warm. Heat a 10-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until hot and cook duck, stirring, until any excess fat is melted and edges are slightly crisp, about 2 minutes. Top each gaufrette with some duck and a scant 1/2 teaspoon chutney.
