Whisk 4 tablespoons oil, vinegar, and horseradish in large bowl to blend. Add beets and onion; toss to blend. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add cabbage and toss until wilted and just crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Stir into beet mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Let stand 10 minutes before serving, stirring occasionally. This vinegar can be found at specialty foods stores. Regular balsamic can be substituted.
