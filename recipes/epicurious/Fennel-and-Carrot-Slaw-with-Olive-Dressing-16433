Chop enough fennel fronds to measure 3 tablespoons and reserve. Discard remaining fronds and stalks. Cut bulbs into thin matchsticks and toss with carrots in a bowl. Whisk together lemon juice, vinegar, oil, olives, Aleppo chile (if using), and salt to taste and toss with vegetables. Chill, covered, at least 30 minutes (for flavors to develop). Just before serving, stir in reserved fronds and sprinkle sun-dried tomatoes and parsley over slaw. Chateau Reynella McLaren Vale Grenache '04
