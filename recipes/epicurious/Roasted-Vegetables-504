Preheat oven to 450°F. Combine leeks, turnips, and sweet potatoes in large roasting pan. Top with bay leaves and drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil. Sprinkle with thyme, salt, and freshly ground black pepper, and toss to coat thoroughly. Place garlic, cut side up, on a piece of foil and drizzle with remaining tablespoon oil. Wrap garlic in foil and place on oven shelf. Place roasting pan next to garlic in oven, and roast until vegetables are just tender and slightly browned, about 35 minutes. Unwrap garlic. Squeeze cloves from their skins, slice cloves, and toss with roasted vegetables. Serve with Slow-Braised Lamb Shanks with Guajillo-Pineapple Sauce .
