Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly coat 9-inch square baking pan with cooking spray or oil. In large bowl, stir together cheese, sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon cardamom seeds. Spread in baking pan and bake until mixture sets, about 45 to 50 minutes. Cool in pan on rack, then cut into 16 (approximately 2-inch) squares. Place squares in 9- by 13-inch baking dish. In large liquid-measuring cup or pitcher, combine half-and-half, almonds, and remaining cardamom seeds. Pour mixture over squares. Sprinkle pistachios over and refrigerate until chilled, 2 to 3 hours. Arrange squares on serving platter.
