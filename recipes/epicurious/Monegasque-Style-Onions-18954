In a large saucepan sauté the onions in the oil over moderately high heat, stirring, until they are browned, add the tomato, the vinegar, the currants, the thyme, the parsley, 1 cup of the water, the garlic paste, the sugar, and salt and pepper to taste, and bring the mixture to a boil. Simmer the mixture, adding more water, 1/2 cup at a time, as the liquid evaporates, for 50 minutes, or until the onions are tender. Cook the mixture over high heat, stirring, until the liquid is reduced to a glaze and let it cool. The onion mixture may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled. Transfer the mixture to a serving dish and serve it with the toast.
