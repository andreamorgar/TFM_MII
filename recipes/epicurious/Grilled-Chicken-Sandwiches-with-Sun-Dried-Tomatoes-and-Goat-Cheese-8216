Place chicken in medium bowl. Add vinegar, olive oil, garlic and rosemary. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Season chicken with salt and pepper. Grill chicken and onions until chicken is just cooked through and onions are golden brown, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes. Grill cut sides of rolls until golden brown. Spread bottom halves of rolls with chopped sun-dried tomatoes. Top with chicken breast and some grilled onions and arugula. Spread top halves of rolls with 1 tablespoon goat cheese and place atop sandwiches. Serve.
