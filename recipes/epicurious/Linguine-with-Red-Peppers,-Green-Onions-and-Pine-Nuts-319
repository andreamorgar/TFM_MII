Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add peppers; sauté until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Add green onions and sauté 2 minutes. Transfer vegetable mixture to bowl. Add cream and wine to same skillet and simmer until mixture thickens, about 3 minutes. Mix in cheese and all but 1 cup vegetable mixture. Simmer sauce 2 minutes to blend flavors; season with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking liquid. Return pasta to pot. Add sauce and toss to coat over medium heat, adding reserved cooking liquid by tablespoonfuls to moisten, if desired. Mound pasta on plates. Garnish with reserved 1 cup vegetables. Sprinkle with pine nuts.
