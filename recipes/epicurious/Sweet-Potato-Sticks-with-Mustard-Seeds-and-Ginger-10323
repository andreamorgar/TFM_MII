Steam potatoes in steamer basket set over boiling water in a 12-inch-wide pot, covered, until tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer carefully to a platter with a wide spatula to avoid breaking sticks. While potatoes steam, cook garlic and ginger in oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderately low heat, stirring, until oil begins to sizzle, about 1 minute, then add mustard seeds, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring, until garlic is pale golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Spoon hot oil mixture over potatoes and sprinkle with cilantro.
