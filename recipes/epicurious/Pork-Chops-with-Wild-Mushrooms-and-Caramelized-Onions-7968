Preheat oven to 350°F. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms; sauté until beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons broth. Cover skillet; cook until mushrooms are beginning to brown, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Uncover; simmer until any juices evaporate. Transfer to bowl. Add 2 teaspoons oil and onion to same skillet. Cover; cook until onion browns, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes; add to mushrooms. Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper. Add to skillet; sauté over medium-high heat until brown, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from heat. Transfer pork to 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Add 3/4 cup broth, then brandy and herbs to skillet. Place over medium-high heat. Boil until reduced by half, scraping up browned bits, about 6 minutes. Pour over pork. Cover. Bake pork until tender, about 25 minutes. Spoon mushrooms and onion over. Cover; bake 5 minutes longer.
