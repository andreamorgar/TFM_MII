Stir nectar and sugar in heavy medium saucepan over high heat until sugar dissolves and syrup comes to boil. Boil until syrup is reduced to 2/3 cup, about 5 minutes. Cool syrup completely (syrup will thicken as it cools). (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature.) Overlap 3 pineapple slice to form ring on each of 6 plates. Place 1 scoop sorbet in center of each ring. Drizzle syrup over, then sprinkle generously with coconut. Garnish with mint.
