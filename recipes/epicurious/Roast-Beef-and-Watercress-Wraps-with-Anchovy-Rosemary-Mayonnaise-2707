Mince garlic with a large heavy knife, then mash to a paste with a pinch of salt using flat side of knife. Whisk together garlic paste, mayonnaise, anchovy paste, lemon juice, rosemary, and pepper in a small bowl. Toast tortillas 1 at a time directly on burner (gas or electric) over moderately high heat, turning over and rotating with tongs, until slightly puffed and browned in spots but still flexible, about 30 seconds each. Transfer to a clean kitchen towel as toasted and stack, loosely wrapped in towel. Spread mayonnaise (about 2 tablespoons, or more to taste) on top of each tortilla, then divide roast beef and watercress among tortillas, covering about half of rounds. Tuck in sides of tortillas and roll up tightly to enclose filling, then cut in half.
