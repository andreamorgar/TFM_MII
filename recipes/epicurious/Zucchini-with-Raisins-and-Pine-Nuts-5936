Heat the oil in a medium skillet and sauté the garlic over moderate heat, stirring, just until the garlic begins to turn golden and becomes aromatic. Do not allow the garlic to overbrown. Add the sliced zucchini and sauté for a few minutes, stirring. Add the tomatoes, anchovy paste, raisins, and vinegar. Mix well, then cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, for about 10 to 12 minutes, until the sauce has thickened and most of the liquid has cooked away. Stir in the black pepper and pine nuts. Serve warm or at room temperature.
