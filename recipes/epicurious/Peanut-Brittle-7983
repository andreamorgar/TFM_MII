1. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick mat, or spray with nonstick spray. Set aside. 2. Combine the sugar, water, tapioca syrup, and salt in a small, heavy nonreactive saucepan and attach a candy thermometer. Put the pan over medium heat and cook without stirring until the mixture reaches 280°F, also known as the "soft crack" stage, 20 to 25 minutes. TIP : Don't walk away from the pan, especially once it reaches around 250°F, when the mixture becomes more likely to burn. 3. Remove the thermometer. Stir in the peanuts and continue to stir frequently as the peanuts toast and the syrup browns. When the peanuts are toasted and a golden color and the syrup is a mahogany brown (about 5 minutes longer), remove from the heat. Carefully stir in the baking soda and, once the mixture is blended, stir in the butter. 4. Pour onto the prepared baking sheet and use a heatproof spatula to spread the peanuts in a single even layer about 1/4 inch thick. (Work quickly before the brittle hardens, but be careful—it's extremely hot!) 5. Let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. If the top of the brittle looks or feels a little greasy, just blot it with a paper towel. Once cool, break into chunks or chop into 1/8- to 1/4-inch pieces and store in an airtight container.
