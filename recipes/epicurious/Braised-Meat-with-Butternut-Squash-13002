Warm 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a sauté pan over low heat. Add the onions, garlic, and rosemary and sauté until tender and translucent, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. Warm the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a heavy pot over high heat. Add the meat and brown well on all sides, sprinkling with a little salt after it has browned. Add the wine and let it bubble up. Add the sautéed onions, the butternut squash, and the broth to cover and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer gently until the meat is tender and the squash has formed a puree, 1 to 1 1/4 hours. Season with salt and pepper before serving. Variation: You can use 3/4 pound carrots, peeled and grated, in place of the squash.
