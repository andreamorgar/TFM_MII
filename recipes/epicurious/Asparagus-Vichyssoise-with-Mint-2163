Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add leek and potato; sauté 2 minutes. Add broth; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium; cover and cook until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Add asparagus. Simmer uncovered until asparagus is just tender, 5 to 6 minutes (depending on thickness of stalks). Remove pan from heat. Transfer 8 asparagus tips to small bowl for garnish. Working in batches, puree soup in blender until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide soup among 4 shallow bowls. Freeze 15 to 20 minutes to chill quickly. Meanwhile, whisk cream, mint, and large pinch of salt in small bowl until cream is slightly thickened. Drizzle mint cream over soup, then garnish with asparagus tips.
