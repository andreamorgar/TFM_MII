Heat oil in a 17- by 11-inch heavy roasting pan (3 inches deep) over moderately high heat, straddled across 2 burners, until hot but not smoking, then brown brisket, starting with fat side down, on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Remove from heat, then add stock and vinegar to pan. Cover pan tightly with heavy-duty foil and braise brisket in oven 2 hours. Add carrots and potatoes to pan and braise, covered, 1 hour. Add prunes and braise, covered, until meat is fork-tender, about 30 minutes more. Cool meat, uncovered, to room temperature, about 1 hour, then chill, covered, at least 12 hours. Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Transfer brisket to a cutting board and slice across the grain about 1/4 inch thick.

Sprinkle with remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/2 teaspoon pepper, then arrange meat with tzimmes and sauce on a large platter.
