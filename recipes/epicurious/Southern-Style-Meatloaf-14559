Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. In large mixing bowl, using hands, gently knead together all ingredients except bacon until just combined. Transfer mixture to a 13 X 9-inch glass baking dish and mound into a 12 X 6-inch oval loaf. Spread bacon strips over loaf and bake until meat is firm and bacon is well done, about 1 hour.
