Heat oil in a 3- to 4-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then cook rice, stirring constantly, until it is pale golden and no longer clumps, about 10 minutes. While rice is cooking, purée onion, garlic, 1/2 cup boiling-hot water, and salt in a blender until smooth (use caution when blending hot liquids). Stir into rice and boil, uncovered, stirring, 1 minute. Stir in remaining 3 1/2 cups hot water and mint and cook, covered, over very low heat until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
