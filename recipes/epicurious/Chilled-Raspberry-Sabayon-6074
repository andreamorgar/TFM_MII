Whisk first 4 ingredients in large metal bowl. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not let bottom of bowl touch water). Using electric mixer, beat mixture until very thick and thermometer registers 160°F., about 12 minutes. Remove bowl from over water and set in larger bowl of ice. Let cool completely, whisking occasionally. Using electric mixer fitted with clean beaters, beat cream to firm peaks. Gently fold into egg mixture. Chill sabayon until cold, about 1 hour. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Divide raspberries among 4 bowls or stemmed goblets. Spoon sabayon over raspberries and serve immediately.
