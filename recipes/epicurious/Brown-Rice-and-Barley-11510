Rinse rice and barley in a medium-mesh sieve, then drain and transfer to a 4- to 5-quart heavy pot. Add water (31/2 cups) and bring to a rolling boil. Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, 45 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 10 minutes, then stir from top to bottom with a rubber spatula.
