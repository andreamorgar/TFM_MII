Prepare grill. In a small saucepan bring water to a boil and remove pan from heat. Stir in bulgur and soak 1 hour. While bulgur is soaking, in a bowl stir together onion, cumin, and salt and let stand 1 hour. Cut about 1/2-inch-thick slices from tops of tomatoes and scoop out insides to form cups. Mince parsley, mint, and garlic. Shuck corn and grill on a lightly oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals, turning occasionally, until browned and tender, 8 to 10 minutes. When corn is cool enough to handle, cut kernels from cobs and add to onion mixture. Drain bulgur in a sieve, pressing hard to extract as much water as possible, and add to corn mixture with parsley, mint, and garlic. In a small bowl whisk together lemon juice, oil, and salt and pepper to taste and drizzle over tabbouleh. Toss tabbouleh well and divide among tomato cups.
