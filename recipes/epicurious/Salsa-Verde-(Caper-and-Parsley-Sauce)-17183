If using capers packed in salt, in a small bowl soak in water to cover by 2 inches for 15 minutes and drain. In a food processor combine all ingredients except vinegar and finely chop. Salsa verde may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring salsa verde to room temperature before proceeding. Just before serving, stir in vinegar.
