In a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan bring sugar, butter, and corn syrup to a boil over moderate heat, stirring, and boil 1 minute. Remove pan from heat and stir in remaining ingredients until mixture is smooth. Cool dough to room temperature. Form and bake cookies as directed below. Preheat oven to 350°F and line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll level 1/2-teaspoons dough into balls and arrange 4 inches apart on baking sheets. Bake cookies in batches in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, 10 minutes, or until cookies are flat and golden. Transfer parchment with cookies to racks to cool. Cool baking sheets and line with fresh parchment between batches.
