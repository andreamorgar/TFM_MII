Rinse quinoa in 5 changes of water in a bowl, rubbing grains and letting them settle before pouring off water (if quinoa does not settle, drain in a large fine sieve after each rinse). Cook quinoa in a large saucepan of boiling salted water 10 minutes. Drain in sieve and rinse under cold water. Set sieve with quinoa over saucepan filled with 1 1/2 inches boiling water (sieve should not touch water) and steam quinoa, covered with a kitchen towel and lid, until fluffy and dry, 10 to 12 minutes. (Check water level in pan occasionally, adding water if necessary.) Toss quinoa with oil and salt and pepper to taste in a large bowl. Cool, then toss with scallion and thyme.
