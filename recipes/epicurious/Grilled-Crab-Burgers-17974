Mix crabmeat, 1 cup breadcrumbs, green onions, 2 tablespoons mayonnaise and Old Bay seasoning in medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Mix in egg yolk. Form mixture into four 2 1/2-inch-diameter patties. Place remaining 1/2 cup breadcrumbs in shallow bowl. Dip patties into crumbs, coating completely. Mix remaining 2 1/2 tablespoons mayonnaise with mustard in small bowl to blend. Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Brush barbecue rack with oil. Grill burgers until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Grill bread slices until lightly toasted, about 1 minute per side. Spread toasts with mustard dressing. Top each with a burger.
