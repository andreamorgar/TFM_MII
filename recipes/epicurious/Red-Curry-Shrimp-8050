Stir red curry paste in large skillet over medium-high heat until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add coconut milk and clam juice and bring to boil, whisking until paste dissolves. Boil until sauce is thick enough to coat spoon, stirring occasionally, about 7 minutes. Add shrimp to sauce. Cook until shrimp turn pink and are just opaque in center, turning occasionally, about 4 minutes. Stir in cilantro. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide shrimp and sauce among 4 shallow bowls. Garnish with lime wedges and serve.
