Heat all ingredients in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until butter has melted. Preheat oven to 200°F. Whisk together flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Whisk together sour cream, milk, egg, and melted butter (2 tablespoons), then whisk into flour mixture. Brush a 12-inch nonstick skillet with melted butter and heat over medium heat until hot. Working in batches, pour a scant 1/4 cup batter per pancake into skillet and cook until bubbles appear on surface and undersides are golden brown. Flip and cook other side, about 1 minute. Transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm in oven. Lightly butter skillet between batches. Serve pancakes with warm syrup.
