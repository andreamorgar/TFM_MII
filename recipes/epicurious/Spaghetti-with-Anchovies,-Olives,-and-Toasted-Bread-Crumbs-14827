In a deep 12-inch heavy skillet heat 2 tablespoons oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and stir in bread crumbs. Toast bread crumbs, stirring constantly, until golden and crisp, about 2 minutes, and transfer to a plate to cool. Wipe skillet clean. In skillet heat remaining 4 tablespoons oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and cook onion, stirring, until golden brown on edges. Remove skillet from heat and add garlic and anchovies. Cook mixture over moderately low heat, stirring until fillets are dissolved, about 2 minutes.

Sprinkle pasta with remaining 1/4 cup parsley and some bread crumbs and serve remaining bread crumbs on the side.
