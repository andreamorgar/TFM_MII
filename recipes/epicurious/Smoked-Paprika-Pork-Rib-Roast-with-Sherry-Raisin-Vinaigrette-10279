Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 500°F. Stir together pimentón, cumin, coriander, salt, and pepper. Rub mixture all over pork. (Press lightly so rub adheres; you will have some leftover rub.) Put pork on a metal rack in a roasting pan, rib side down. Roast pork 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 300°F and continue to roast until a meat thermometer inserted diagonally into center registers 140°F, 1 hour 10 minutes to 1 hour 25 minutes more. Let pork stand, loosely covered with foil, 20 to 25 minutes before carving. (Temperature of meat will rise to about 150°F.) Soak raisins in Sherry in a medium bowl, covered, 30 minutes. Add vinegar, shallot, garlic, salt, and pepper, then add oil in a slow stream, whisking until combined. Whisk in parsley just before serving. Slice pork and serve with vinaigrette and a sprinkling of kosher salt.
