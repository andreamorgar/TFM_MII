Combine the cardamom, garlic, bay leaves, star anise, vinegar, wine, honey, and soy sauce. Stir until the honey is dissolved. Place the beef in an airtight bag or container with the marinade. Marinate for 8 hours, turning once. Scrape the marinade from the beef; pat dry. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat 30 seconds, until hot but not shimmering. Place the beef in the center of the pan. Cook slowly for 10 minutes without disturbing. Turn; cook 5 minutes more. Transfer the meat to a board to let it rest for 5 minutes. Whisk together the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, the Champagne vinegar, and herbs. Season with salt and pepper. Slice the beef thinly, and serve dressed with the vinaigrette.
