Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add sausage and onion and cook until golden, stirring often, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes with juice, then clams. Pour wine over. Bring to simmer. Cover pan and simmer until clams open, 5 to 10 minutes depending on size of clams (discard any that do not open). Transfer clams to shallow bowls. Bring broth to boil. Season with hot sauce and half of cilantro. Ladle broth and sausage over clams. Sprinkle with remaining cilantro.
