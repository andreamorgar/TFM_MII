1. Preheat oven to 350°F. 2. Cook the macaroni until tender. Drain, toss with a little bit of the oil, and set aside. 3. In a medium nonstick saucepan, whisk together the milk and cornstarch until well blended. Stirring often, bring to a boil over medium heat. 4. Stir in the mustard, pepper, and salt. Reduce heat to low and simmer until thickened. 5. Stir in the cheddar until it melts, then fold in the macaroni. 6. Butter two cupcake pans and coat with the bread crumbs. (Be sure to shake off the excess.) 7. Fold the chives into the macaroni mixture. Spoon the mixture into the pans and top with bread crumbs to taste. 8. Bake until golden on top, 15 to 25 minutes.
