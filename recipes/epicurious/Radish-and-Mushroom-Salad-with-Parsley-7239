In a bowl whisk together oil, sour cream, lemon juice, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste until smooth. Add radishes and mushrooms and toss gently to coat with dressing. Nestle 1 lettuce leaf inside another, rib sides down, and arrange on plate to form a cup. Repeat with remaining lettuce and divide salad between lettuce cups.
