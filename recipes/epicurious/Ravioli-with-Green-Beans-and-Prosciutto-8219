Cook ravioli according to package directions in boiling salted water (1 tablespoon salt for 4 quarts water). 3 When ravioli have 5 minutes of cooking time left, heat oil in a heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté beans with a pinch of salt until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and sauté 30 seconds. Reserve 1/4 cup pasta-cooking water, then drain ravioli. Reduce skillet heat to very low and stir in reserved cooking water, sour cream, lemon juice, cheese, and a pinch of pepper. Add ravioli and prosciutto and gently toss to coat.
