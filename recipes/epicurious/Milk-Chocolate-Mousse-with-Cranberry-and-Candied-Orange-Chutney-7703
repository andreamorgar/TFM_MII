Whisk yolks and salt to blend in medium bowl. Bring milk to simmer in medium saucepan. Gradually whisk hot milk into yolk mixture; return to same pan. Stir over low heat until custard thickens, about 1 minute (do not boil). Remove from heat; add chocolate. Whisk until chocolate melts and mousse base is smooth; whisk in rum. Cool 45 minutes. Beat 3/4 cup cream in bowl until peaks form; fold into mousse base. Cover; chill at least 4 hours. Beat 3/4 cup cream in another bowl until peaks form. Drop 1 1/2 tablespoons chutney into each dessert dish. Top with 1/2 cup mousse, 1 1/2 tablespoons chutney, a dollop of whipped cream, and chocolate shavings. Cover; chill up to 1 day.
