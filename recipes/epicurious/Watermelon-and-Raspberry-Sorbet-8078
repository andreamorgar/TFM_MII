In a saucepan simmer water with sugar, stirring, until sugar dissolves. In a blender purée watermelon, sugar syrup, lemon juice, and 1/2 cup raspberries and strain though a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing hard on solids. (Chill mixture, covered, until cold, about 2 hours.) Freeze mixture in an ice-cream maker. Serve scoops garnished with remaining 1/2 cup raspberries. (Sorbet may be made 1 week ahead.)
