Cut potatoes crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Cover with salted cold water by 1 inch, then simmer gently until just tender but not falling apart, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a baking sheet lined with paper towels and spread in 1 layer to cool to room temperature. Season well with salt and pepper and transfer to a large platter. Spoon 1/2 teaspoon sour cream onto center of each potato slice and top with 1/4 teaspoon caviar.
