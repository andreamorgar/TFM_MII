In a 10-quart pot, bring the water to a brisk boil. Add salt and stir in the pasta shells. When the water returns to a boil, begin timing and cook al dente according to the package directions. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta, but do not rinse. Transfer the shells to a large serving bowl. Stir in the reserved pasta water to keep the pasta from sticking to itself. Pasta continues to cook and absorb water even when it has been drained. Add in the salsa cruda ingredients and toss. Garnish with chopped parsley leaves. Preparation time: 10 minutes; cooking time: 15 minutes
