Bring sugar and water to a boil in a 1-quart saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and cool syrup. Purée cantaloupe with 2 tablespoons lime juice in a blender, then transfer to a bowl and stir in 1 cup sugar syrup. Purée honeydew with remaining 2 tablespoons lime juice in cleaned blender, then transfer to another bowl and stir in remaining cup sugar syrup. Chill both mixtures, covered, until cold, about 2 hours. Freeze sorbets separately in ice cream maker. Transfer to airtight containers and freeze until firm but still spreadable, about 30 minutes. Lightly brush mold with vegetable oil and freeze mold 30 minutes. While mold chills, put vanilla ice cream in refrigerator 20 minutes to soften. Pulse almonds in a food processor until finely ground (do not grind to a paste). Stir together almonds, ice cream, and almond extract until blended. Spread evenly onto bottom and up sides of chilled mold. (If ice cream begins to melt, freeze 10 minutes.) Freeze ice cream until firm, about 30 minutes. Spread honeydew sorbet in an even layer over ice cream and freeze until sorbet is firm, about 20 minutes. Fill center with cantaloupe sorbet, pressing in firmly, and smooth top. Cover mold with plastic wrap and freeze until hardened, at least 8 hours. To serve, unwrap mold and invert bombe onto a chilled serving platter. Wet a kitchen towel with hot water, quickly wring it dry, and drape over pan 30 seconds. Lift off pan, then peel off plastic wrap and put bombe in refrigerator 10 minutes to soften.
