Using sharp knife, cut away all peel and white pith from oranges. Cut oranges crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Cut each slice in half. Set aside. Whisk juice, olive oil, vinegar, walnut oil and orange peel in medium bowl to blend. Season with salt and pepper. Combine endive, arugula and orange slices in large bowl. Add vinaigrette and toss to coat. Sprinkle with walnuts.
