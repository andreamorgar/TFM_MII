Heat oven to 350°F. Chill crust 15 minutes. Remove from fridge; prick crust at 1-inch intervals with a fork. Line with waxed paper; fill with pie weights or uncooked rice. Bake until golden, 30 minutes. When crust is cool, lift waxed paper to remove weights. Increase oven heat to 400°F. Spread jam on crust to cover bottom. In a bowl, whisk eggs and vanilla. In a thick-bottomed pot (to prevent burning), whisk milk with peanut butter and sugar over medium heat until steaming; remove from heat. Whisk peanut butter mixture into egg-vanilla mixture until combined; spoon filling into crust. Bake until filling is set at edges but center jiggles when you shake pan, 15 minutes. Heat broiler. Top pie with marshmallows; broil, rotating once or twice for even browning, until marshmallows are puffed and golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Let cool for at least 3 hours. Top with raspberries and serve.
