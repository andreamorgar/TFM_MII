Cut meat off chicken and dice. Place both carcasses, 5 quarts water, halved onion, whole garlic cloves, carrot chunks, celery chunks, 2 bay leaves, parsley sprigs, thyme sprigs, and allspice in 8-to 10-quart pot. Bring to boil. Reduce heat. Simmer 1 1/4 hours. Strain broth; return to pot and boil until reduced to 7 cups. Heat oil in another large pot over medium-high heat. Add chopped onion, sliced garlic, and 2 bay leaves; sauté 2 minutes. Add carrot cubes, chopped thyme, celery root, sweet potatoes, parsnips, 1 teaspoon sea salt, and 7 cups broth; bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Add diced chicken; season with more salt and pepper. Garnish with chopped parsley.
