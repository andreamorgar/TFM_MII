Position 1 rack in top third and 1 rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 375°F. Spray 2 heavy large rimmed baking sheets with nonstick spray. Cut carrots and parsnips into 3- to 4-inch lengths. Fit processor with 1/4-inch-thick slicing disk. Working in batches, place carrot pieces upright and fitting snugly side by side in feed tube of processor. With machine running, use plunger to push down firmly on carrots and cut uniform round slices. Transfer carrot coins to extra-large bowl. Repeat with parsnips, then potatoes. Add olive oil, 2 teaspoons coarse salt, coriander, cardamom, and freshly ground black pepper to vegetable mixture and toss to coat. Divide mixture between prepared baking sheets. Roast vegetables until tender and golden brown around edges, about 1 hour. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm in 350°F oven until heated through, about 15 minutes. Transfer roasted vegetable coins to large bowl and serve.
