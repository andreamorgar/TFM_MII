Preheat oven to 350°F. If using small brioches, cut off tops (about 1 inch). On baking sheet arrange tops and bottoms of brioche, cut side up, or slices from loaf in one layer. Toast brioche in middle of oven until golden. While brioche is toasting, in a bowl lightly whisk together eggs, chives, and tarragon. In a non-stick skillet heat butter over moderate heat until foam subsides and cook bell pepper, stirring, until softened. Add eggs and cook, stirring, until just cooked through, about 3 minutes. Stir in sour cream and pepper and salt to taste and cook, stirring, until just heated through. Divide brioche and eggs between 2 plates and top with Chive Sour Cream.
