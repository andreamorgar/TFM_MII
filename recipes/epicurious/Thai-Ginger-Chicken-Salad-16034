Whisk first 4 ingredients, 2 teaspoons ginger, and garlic in a small bowl until sugar dissolves. Set dressing aside. Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to the bite, 2-4 minutes. Drain; put in a large bowl. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet. Add chicken; stir 1 minute. Add 1 tablespoons ginger, shallot, and lemongrass. Stir until chicken is cooked through, 3-4 minutes. Add to noodles. Add half of all herbs and half of dressing; toss to coat. Line bowls with lettuce leaves. Divide noodle mixture among bowls. Top with remaining herbs and dressing.
