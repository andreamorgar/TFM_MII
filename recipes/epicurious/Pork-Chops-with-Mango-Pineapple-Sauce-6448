Sprinkle both sides of pork chops with 1 teaspoon salt and 3/4 teaspoon pepper (total), then chill, covered, at least 4 hours (to allow seasoning to permeate meat). Purée chopped mango in a food processor until smooth, then force through a sieve into a bowl. Bring mango purée, butter, pineapple, mango nectar, brown sugar, mustard, cloves, and remaining teaspoon each salt and pepper to a boil in a 1 1/2- to 2-quart heavy saucepan, stirring until butter is melted, then simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 12 to 15 minutes. Discard cloves. Pat pork chops dry. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then brown chops in 2 batches, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side. Transfer to a plate as browned. Pour off all but about 1 1/2 tablespoons fat from skillet, then cook onion over moderate heat, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add sauce and pork chops (with any juices) and simmer, uncovered, turning chops over once, until just cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle with cilantro.
