Cook broccoli in large saucepan of boiling water until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Drain well. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic, oregano, lemon juice and red pepper flakes. Cook until garlic is just golden, stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Reduce heat to medium and add mushrooms and zucchini. Cook until just tender, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add wine and simmer 2 minutes. Add broccoli, olives and tomatoes; cook until broccoli is tender, about 4 minutes. Place pasta in large bowl and toss with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add vegetable mixture and combine well. Serve, passing Romano separately.
