1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter a 9-inch Pyrex pie plate. 2. Gently combine the berries with the sugar, flour and cinnamon; place in the prepared pie plate. 3. Prepare the topping: Combine the oats, flour, both sugars and salt in a bowl. Use a pastry blender or 2 knives to work in the butter until topping resembles coarse meal. Sprinkle evenly over the berries. 4. Place the pie plate on a baking sheet. Bake in the center of the oven until the fruit is bubbling and the topping is golden brown, about 1 hour. Remove the crisp to a rack to cool slightly. Serve in dessert bowls with whipped cream or ice cream.
