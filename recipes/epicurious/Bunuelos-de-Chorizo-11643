Sauté the chorizo in the olive oil until it gives up some of its oil but does not burn or get too crisp, about 30 seconds on low to medium heat. Put a cup of water in a saucepan. Once the chorizo pan has cooled down to room temperature, strain off the oil directly into the water. Set aside the rendered chorizo. Add a generous pinch of salt to the water and bring to a boil. Once the water is boiling, add the flour all at once and reduce heat immediately to low, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon to create a dough. Just as you feel the dough begin to stick to the bottom of the pan, transfer to a stand mixer with paddle attachment in place. Mix on low speed and add eggs, one at a time, waiting until each one is fully incorporated. This should form a nice, smooth dough that is slightly runny. Fold in chorizo and scallion. Fold in piment d'Espelette, to taste. Heat a deep pot of unused vegetable oil to 385°F. Fry teaspoon-size balls of dough until very light gold and cooked through, approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Remove fried dough to paper towel or cloth and serve warm. These should pull apart very easily and the centers should be light and airy. Season with salt, if necessary.
