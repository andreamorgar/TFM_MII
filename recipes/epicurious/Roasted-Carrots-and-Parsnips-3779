Preheat oven to 425°F. Divide parsnips and carrots between 2 shallow baking pans and toss each pan of vegetables with 1 1/2 tablespoons oil. Spread vegetables in one layer and season with salt and pepper. Roast vegetables in oven, switching positions of pans in oven halfway through baking and stirring occasionally, about 20 to 25 minutes, or until browned and crisp, and garnish with carrot tops.
