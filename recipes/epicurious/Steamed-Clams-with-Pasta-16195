Cook linguine in pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite; drain. Meanwhile, cook clams in large pot with parsley, garlic, olive oil, and red pepper. Let cook until clams open, about ten minutes. Divide pasta among bowls. Top with seafood mixture and juices, discarding any clams that do not open; serve.
