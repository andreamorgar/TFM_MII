Combine anchovies (if using), garlic, capers, and chile in a mortar or food processor. Pound with a pestle or process until a chunky paste forms. Add herbs and stir to combine. Remove pestle or transfer paste to a bowl. Using a fork, slowly whisk in oil to make sauce. Season to taste with salt, if desired. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes while flavors meld. DO AHEAD: Sauce can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature and stir before serving.
