Heat 3 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and half of garlic; sauté 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and 3/4 cup basil. Cook 15 minutes to blend flavors, stirring often and adding water if dry. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Chill.) Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large saucepan over medium heat. Add remaining garlic; sauté; 1 minute. Add spinach; cook until most of liquid evaporates, stirring often, about 5 minutes. Drain and cool. Squeeze out liquid. Place spinach in processor. Add ricotta and blend well. Blend in 1/2 cup Parmesan. Season filling to taste with nutmeg, salt and pepper. Place 1 wonton wrapper on work surface. Brush edges with water. Place 1 scant tablespoon filling on 1 half. Fold diagonally in half, forming triangle. Press edges to seal. Overlap 2 ends together; press to adhere. Repeat with remaining wrappers, water and filling. Place in single layer on floured baking sheet. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover with plastic; chill.) Working in batches, cook tortelloni in pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer to bowls. Meanwhile, bring sauce to simmer. Spoon over pasta. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup basil.
