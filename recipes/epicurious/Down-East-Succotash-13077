Cook bacon in large skillet over medium heat until crisp and brown. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels to drain. Pour off all but 3 tablespoons fat from skillet. Return skillet to medium heat. Add shallots; sauté 3 minutes. Stir in corn, lima beans, Turkey Stock and fresh tarragon. Cook uncovered until lima beans are tender and most of stock evaporates, stirring often, about 14 minutes. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.) Add bacon and tomatoes. Cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
