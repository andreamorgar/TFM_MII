Heat 1/4 cup oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, celery and rosemary and sauté until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Add squash, tomatoes and 1/2 cup water. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until squash is tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in prosciutto and parsley. Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain. Return pasta to same pot. Add 2 tablespoons oil, squash mixture and 1/2 cup Parmesan to pasta; toss. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan.
