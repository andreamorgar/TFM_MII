Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallots and minced rosemary and sauté until tender, about 3 minutes. Add yams and broth to skillet and bring to boil. Cover skillet, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until yams are almost tender, about 10 minutes. Add cream and sprinkle lightly with nutmeg. Simmer uncovered until yams are very tender and liquid thickens and coats yams, about 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Transfer to microwave-safe dish. Chill until cold, then cover and keep chilled. Rewarm, covered, in microwave on medium-low heat.)
