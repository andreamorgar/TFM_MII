Cut orange segments into 1/8-inch pieces over a bowl; collect juice (about 1/3 cup); set orange segments aside. Whisk orange juice, wine, pomegranate concentrate, 2 tablespoons of honey, oil, garlic and oregano in a bowl. Arrange lamb in a 9" x 13" baking dish; pour marinade over lamb. Cover; chill 1 to 2 hours, turning once. Combine cut orange, pomegranate seeds, onion, mint, remaining 1 tablespoon honey and lemon juice in a bowl. Toss gently; chill. Heat a grill or grill pan to medium-high. Remove lamb from dish, pat dry and grill to desired doneness (3 minutes per side for medium-rare). Let rest 1 to 2 minutes. Serve topped with relish.
