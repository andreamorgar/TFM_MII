Blend the peanut butter with the banana until creamy. Spread the mixture over 5 slices of the bread. Top with the remaining bread. In a skillet melt enough butter to coat the bottom of the pan. Place the sandwiches in the butter and grill them until the bread is lightly toasted. Flip to grill the other side. Drain on paper towels.
