Mix flour, salt and yeast in processor. Add rosemary, thyme, honey and oil. Gradually blend in enough water to bind dough together. Process until dough forms ball, about 30 seconds longer. Turn dough out onto work surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 2 minutes. Lightly oil large bowl. Add dough; turn to coat with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, then towel. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down dough. Divide into 16 equal pieces. Roll each dough piece between palms and work surface into 12-inch-long by 1/2-inch-wide rope. Arrange ropes on 2 heavy large baking sheets, spacing 1 inch apart. Let rise uncovered in warm draft-free area until almost doubled, about 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 325°F. Bake until breadsticks are very crisp and pale golden, about 40 minutes. Transfer breadsticks to racks and cool. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)
