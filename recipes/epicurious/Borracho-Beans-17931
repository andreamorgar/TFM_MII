Sort the beans to remove any stones or grit. Rinse the beans in a colander and place in a large pan with the water and beer. Add the garlic, onion, epazote (if using), chile powder, cumin, pork or bacon, tomatoes, and salt. Boil the beans for an hour and then reduce to a simmer and cook over very low heat until soft (12 hours in crockpot or other slow cooker works best). Keep the level of the broth a good inch or so above the beans, and add more water as needed. Serve with broth in a bowl as a side dish.
