Heat oil in heavy Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add chopped onion, garlic, oregano and crushed red pepper and sauté 5 minutes. Add tomatoes with their juices and black and green olives; simmer until sauce begins to thicken, about 8 minutes. Add pasta and 1 cup Parmesan cheese; toss until sauce coats pasta. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer pasta to large shallow bowl. Pass additional Parmesan separately.
