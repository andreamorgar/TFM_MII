1. Prepare a medium fire in the grill. 2. Combine the butter and brown sugar in a shallow dish. Peel the bananas, cut in half lengthwise, and then again crosswise. Add the bananas to the butter mixture and toss very gently to coat. 3. Grill the bananas, turning once, until a crispy brown coating of caramelized sugar forms on the surface, about 5 minutes per side. Watch carefully; don't allow the sugar to char. 4. Remove from the grill and, if desired, drizzle the rum or liqueur on top. Serve hot.
