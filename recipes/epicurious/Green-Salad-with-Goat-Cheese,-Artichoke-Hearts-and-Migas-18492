Heat remaining 6 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add prosciutto; stir 2 minutes. Add bread pieces; stir to coat with oil.

Season with pepper; sprinkle lightly with salt. Place romaine, arugula, red onion and vinegar in large bowl. Add artichoke mixture; toss to blend. Season salad to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon bread mixture over center of salad. Sprinkle with goat cheese.
