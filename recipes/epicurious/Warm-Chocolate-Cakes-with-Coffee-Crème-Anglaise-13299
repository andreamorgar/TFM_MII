Bring first 4 ingredients to a simmer in a medium pan over medium heat, stirring continuously. Remove vanilla bean; scrape seeds into sauce. Place egg yolk in a bowl. Stir in 2 tbsp hot-milk mixture; add back to pan. Cook 1 minute; stir. Remove from heat; cool. Cover and refrigerate. Beat egg white in a bowl with an electric mixer on high until foamy. Add 1/2 tsp sugar; continue beating on high, adding 5 more 1/2-tsp increments of sugar until stiff peaks form. In another bowl, beat egg yolk with remaining 1 tbsp sugar until thick. Melt chocolate in a double boiler or microwave. Remove from heat; stir in yogurt; add to egg yolk mixture. Fold in egg white mixture. Cover; refrigerate at least 1 hour. Heat oven to 325°F. Coat 4 molds in a muffin tin with cooking spray; pour in batter. Bake 12 minutes or until cake springs back when touched. Cool slightly. Pour 2 tbsp sauce on each of 4 plates (or serve in a creamer on the side); put 1 cake on top of each.
