Place porcini in small bowl; pour 1 cup boiling water over. Let stand until soft, about 45 minutes. Drain, reserving soaking liquid. Chop porcini; set aside. Heat large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add sausage; sauté until brown, breaking up into small pieces with back of fork. Add porcini, shallots, and garlic. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and cook until sausage is cooked through, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Transfer sausage mixture and any juices to medium bowl. Stir bread cubes, spinach, and rosemary into sausage mixture. Season with coarse salt and pepper. Mix in 1/4 cup reserved porcini soaking liquid. Cover and chill stuffing overnight. Bring stuffing to room temperature. Just before using, whisk egg to blend in small bowl and mix into stuffing.
