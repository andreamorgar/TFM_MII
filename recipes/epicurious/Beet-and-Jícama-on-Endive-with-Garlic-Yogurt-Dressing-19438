Drain yogurt in a large sieve lined with double thickness of cheesecloth, chilled, at least 8 hours. Stir drained yogurt with garlic, mint, and salt to taste. Preheat oven to 425°F. Wrap beets in foil and roast in middle of oven 1 1/4 hours, or until tender when pierced with a knife. Cool beets. Peel beets and jícamas and cut into 1/4-inch dice. Toss with sugar, zest, orange juice, vinegar, oil, fennel, and salt to taste. Stir lemon juice into a large bowl of cold water. Cut ends from endives and separate into leaves. Soak in lemon water 10 minutes to keep endive from discoloring. Drain and spin dry. Spread some dressing on each leaf and spoon beet salad over it.
