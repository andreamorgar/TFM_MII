Bring 1 1/2 cups water and 3 tablespoons oil to simmer in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add squid and onion. Cover and simmer 15 minutes. Add 1/4 cup minced parsley and rosemary. Cover and simmer until squid is tender, about 10 minutes. Transfer mixture to large jar. Add vinegar, garlic, peppercorns and bay leaf. Cover and refrigerate overnight. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Keep refrigerated.) Preheat broiler. Brush baguette slices with 2 tablespoons oil. Broil until golden, watching closely to avoid burning. Drain squid mixture. Discard rosemary sprigs, garlic and bay leaf. Transfer squid mixture to medium bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Drizzle with additional olive oil, if desired, and sprinkle with parsley. Serve with toasted baguette slices.
