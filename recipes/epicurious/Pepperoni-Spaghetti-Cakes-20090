In a large saucepan of boiling salted water cook the spaghetti until it is al dente and drain it well. While the spaghetti is cooking, in a bowl toss together the pepperoni, the bell pepper, the Parmesan, the sliced scallion greens, the garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. Toss the spaghetti with the mixture, add the egg, and toss the mixture well. In a non-stick skillet measuring 6 inches across the bottom heat 1/2 teaspoon of the oil over moderate heat until it is hot but not smoking, add half the spaghetti mixture, pressing it evenly, and cook the spaghetti cake for 3 minutes, or until the underside is golden. Turn the spaghetti cake, cook it for 3 minutes more, or until the underside is golden, and transfer it to a plate. Make a second spaghetti cake in the same manner with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon oil and spaghetti mixture and transfer it to another plate. Keeping 1/2 inch of one end of each scallion green piece intact, make lengthwise cuts to form brushes. Spoon a dollop of the sour cream onto each spaghetti cake and arrange the scallion brushes on the cakes.
