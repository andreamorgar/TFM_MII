Stir first 5 ingredients in medium bowl to blend. Season salsa with salt and pepper. Cook tortillas over gas flame until blackened in spots, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer to work surface. Sprinkle 4 tortillas with both cheeses and hominy, dividing equally; top with remaining 4 tortillas. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in each of 2 heavy large skillets over medium heat. Place 2 quesadillas in each skillet. Cook until bottoms are crisp and brown, pressing occasionally with spatula, about 2 minutes. Turn quesadillas over. Cook until bottoms are brown and cheeses melt, adding more oil as needed, about 2 minutes longer. Cut quesadillas into quarters. Arrange 4 quarters on each of 4 plates. Serve with salsa.
