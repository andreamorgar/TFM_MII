Bring water and sugar to simmer in heavy small saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Simmer syrup 1 minute. Remove from heat; mix in rum and grenadine, if desired. Cover syrup and refrigerate until chilled. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.) Arrange mango and banana slices on 2 plates, dividing equally. Spoon syrup over fruit. Squeeze 1 lime wedge over each and serve.
