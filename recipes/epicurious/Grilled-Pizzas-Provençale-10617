Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Stir tomatoes, arugula, olives, oil and garlic in medium bowl to combine; season topping with salt and pepper. Unroll pizza dough onto floured baking sheet; cut into 4 pieces (each about 5 by 5 inches). Transfer dough, floured side down, to barbecue. Grill until bottoms are golden, about 5 minutes. Using spatula, return dough, grilled side up, to same baking sheet. Brush off any excess flour. Divide topping and then goat cheese among crusts. Using spatula, transfer pizzas to grill. Cover with grill top or heavy-duty foil. Grill until bottoms are brown and topping is heated through, about 3 minutes. Serve pizzas hot.
