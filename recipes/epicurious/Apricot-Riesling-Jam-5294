Combine 2 1/2 pounds apricots, halved, pitted, 2 cups sugar, and 1/2 cup Riesling in a large heavy pot, stirring to dissolve sugar. Let sit until apricots start to release their juices, 20–30 minutes. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally at first and then more often as mixture thickens (as sugars concentrate, jam will be more likely to scorch), until most of the liquid evaporates and mixture is thickened, 30–40 minutes. To test for thickness, place a small dollop of jam on a chilled plate and chill 2 minutes. Drag your finger through: It should leave a clear path that doesn't fill in. Divide between jars, cover, and chill. Jam can be made 2 months ahead. Keep chilled.
