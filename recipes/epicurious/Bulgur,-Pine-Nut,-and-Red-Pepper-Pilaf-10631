In a small heavy saucepan cook onion in oil over moderate heat, stirring, until softened. Stir in broth, bell pepper, and bulgur and bring liquid to a boil. Cook mixture, covered, over low heat 12 minutes, or until liquid is absorbed. Remove pan from heat and let stand, covered, 5 minutes. Stir in pine nuts, chives, and salt and pepper to taste.
