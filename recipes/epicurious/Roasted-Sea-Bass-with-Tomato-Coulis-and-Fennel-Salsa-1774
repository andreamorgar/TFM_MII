Blend tomatoes in processor until almost smooth. Gradually blend in oil, then vinegar. Process until coulis is smooth, scraping down sides of bowl occasionally. Season coulis with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Whisk until smooth before using.) Whisk oil and vinegar to blend in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper. Place fish in marinade in dish; turn to coat. Chill at least 1 hour and up to 2 hours. Position 1 rack in top third and 1 rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 400°F. Place 1 large rimmed baking sheet on each rack and heat 15 minutes. Dust flat side of each fillet with flour. Brush each heated baking sheet generously with oil. Place 5 fillets, floured side down, on each prepared sheet. Place fish in oven and roast until just opaque in center, about 12 minutes. Spoon 3 tablespoons coulis into center of each plate. Top with fish. Spoon salsa alongside. Garnish with basil.
