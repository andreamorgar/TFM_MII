Combine berries in a large bowl. Heat wine, crème de cassis, and sugar in a small heavy saucepan, stirring, until sugar is dissolved, then pour over berries. Toss gently and let stand 10 minutes. Heat 1/2 inch oil in a heavy skillet over moderate heat until a won ton strip sizzles when added. Fry strips in 2 or 3 batches, stirring gently with a slotted spoon, until golden, about 30 seconds. Drain on paper towels. Top compote with ice cream, then won ton strips.
