In a skillet cook bacon over moderate heat until crisp. Drain bacon on paper towels and crumble. Trim asparagus and in a saucepan of boiling salted water cook until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. In a colander drain asparagus and refresh under cold water. Cut asparagus into 1/2-inch-thick pieces, leaving about 2 inches of tops intact. In a large bowl whisk together vinegar, mustard, and salt and pepper to taste and add oil in a stream, whisking until emulsified. Tear frisée or chicory into bite-size pieces and add to dressing with asparagus and bacon. Toss salad to combine.
