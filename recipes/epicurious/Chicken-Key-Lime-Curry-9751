Blend 1 cup onions with ginger, garlic, and 1/2 cup water in a blender. Heat oil in a 12- to 14-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Pat chicken dry and season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Brown, skin side down, about 6 minutes (don't turn over), then transfer to a plate. Add remaining onions to skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to plate with chicken. Reduce heat to medium and add onion-ginger paste to skillet. Cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add curry powder and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Stir in tomato paste, remaining 2 cups water, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt and bring to a simmer. Return chicken and onions to skillet with sliced lime and simmer, partially covered, turning chicken once, until just cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes.
