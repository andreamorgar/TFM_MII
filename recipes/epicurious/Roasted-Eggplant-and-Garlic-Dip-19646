Preheat oven to 425°F. Separate garlic cloves without peeling and tightly wrap together in foil. Prick eggplant with a fork. In a shallow baking pan roast garlic and eggplant in middle of oven until very tender, about 30 minutes for garlic and about 45 minutes for eggplant. Unwrap garlic and peel, transferring garlic to a food processor. Scrape flesh from eggplant into food processor, discarding skin. Purée mixture until smooth and, with motor running, add oil and vinegar until combined. Season dip with salt and pepper and serve with pita toasts.
