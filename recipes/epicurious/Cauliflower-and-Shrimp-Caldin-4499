Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F. Pierce softest eye of coconut with a metal skewer or small screwdriver and drain liquid. Bake coconut 15 minutes. Break shell with a hammer or back of a heavy cleaver and remove flesh, prying it out carefully with tip of a flat-head screwdriver. Remove brown membrane with a sharp paring knife or vegetable peeler. Coarsely chop one third of coconut (reserve remainder for another use) and finely grind in a blender. Measure out 1/2 cup ground coconut (reserve remainder for another use) and purée with garlic, half of onion, and 1/2 cup water in blender until a paste forms. Cook remaining onion in oil in a wide 4- to 5-quart heavy pot over moderate heat, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add coconut paste, cumin, turmeric, and chile and cook at a bare simmer (do not let boil), stirring, 3 minutes. Stir in 2 cups water and cook at a bare simmer (do not let boil), uncovered, 15 minutes. Add cauliflower and cook at a bare simmer (do not let boil), uncovered, stirring occasionally, until just tender, 15 to 20 minutes. While cauliflower cooks, toss shrimp with 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Gently mash tamarind pulp with remaining 2 tablespoons water in another small bowl until pulp is softened. Force pulp through a sieve into a bowl, discarding seeds and thick fibers. Pat shrimp dry and stir into cauliflower along with tamarind, canned coconut milk, and vinegar. Bring to a bare simmer (do not let boil) and cook until shrimp are just cooked through, about 3 minutes. Stir in remaining teaspoon salt. *Available at Indian markets and Kalustyan's (800-352-3451; kalustyans.com).
