Heat oven to 400°F. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. Place prosciutto slices 4 inches apart on baking sheet; cook until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with a paper towel. Whisk yogurt, mayonnaise, honey, zest, juice and pepper in a bowl until smooth. Add honeydew and cantaloupe; toss to combine; divide among 4 bowls. Crumble prosciutto; sprinkle it and basil over salad. Serve immediately.
