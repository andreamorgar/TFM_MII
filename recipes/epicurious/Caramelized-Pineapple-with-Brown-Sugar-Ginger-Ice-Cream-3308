Preheat broiler. Line large baking sheet with foil. Arrange pineapple wedges side by side in single layer on prepared baking sheet. Pat pineapple wedges with paper towels to remove excess moisture. Using fingertips, press 1 cup brown sugar through coarse sifter over pineapple. Broil pineapple wedges until brown sugar caramelizes, watching closely to avoid burning and rotating baking sheet to broil evenly, about 3 minutes. Arrange 3 wedges of warm caramelized pineapple in triangle on each of 6 plates. Place scoop of Brown Sugar-Ginger Ice Cream in center of pineapple triangle. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon coconut over each dessert and serve.
