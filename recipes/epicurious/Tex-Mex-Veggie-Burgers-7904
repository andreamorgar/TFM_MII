Blend 1/2 cup corn kernels and 1 tablespoon cornmeal in processor until moist clumps form. Add 3/4 cup corn kernels; process 10 seconds (reserve remaining corn for another use). Transfer corn mixture to heavy medium nonstick saucepan. Add 1/2 cup corn liquid, onion, bell pepper and lime peel. Cover and cook over very low heat until thick and firm, stirring often, 12 minutes. Mix in rice, cilantro, jalapeño, salt and cumin. Drop 1/4 of mixture onto each of 4 pieces of foil; press pieces into 3/4-inch-thick patties. Let stand until completely cool. Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Spray both sides of burgers with nonstick spray; grill until crisp, about 5 minutes per side. Grill tortillas until pliable, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer tortillas to plates. On each tortilla place 1 burger, 1/4 of sour cream and 1/4 of salsa. Fold tortillas over to enclose.
