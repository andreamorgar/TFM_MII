Heat oven to 350°F. Coat an 8" x 8" baking dish with cooking spray. In a bowl, whisk together flours, cocoa, baking powder and salt; set aside. In another bowl, beat butter, sugar and coffee with an electric mixer on high until crumbly, about 30 seconds. Add eggs one at a time; beat on medium until a thick mocha-colored mixture forms. Add half-and-half, vanilla and chocolate chips; beat on low until just combined. Add flour mixture; beat on low until a thick batter forms. Pour into baking dish and top with cherries. Bake until edges are slightly firm but center is soft, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool 30 minutes; cut into 12 pieces.
