Bring 2 1/4 cups water to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Mix in rice and salt. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 40 minutes. Transfer rice to large bowl; fluff with fork and cool. Whisk vinegar and sugar in small bowl. Gradually whisk in oil. Pour over rice. Add tomatoes and basil and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover; chill. Bring to room temperature before serving.)
