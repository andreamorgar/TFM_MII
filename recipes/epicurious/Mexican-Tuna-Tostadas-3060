Heat oven to 350°F. Cut 2 rounds from each tortilla with a 3-inch cookie cutter. Brush both sides of tortillas with 1 tablespoon of oil and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Place rounds in 1 layer on cookie sheets; bake until crisp and edges are golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from oven. Whisk chipotle, remaining 2 tablespoon oil, lime juice, tequila, adobo sauce, cumin, sugar and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Place tuna, avocado, 2/3 of scallions and 2 tablespoons of pumpkin seeds in another bowl. Pour dressing over top and gently stir to coat, trying not to break up avocado. Spoon tuna mixture onto tortilla rounds. Top with remaining 1 tablespoon pumpkin seeds and remaining 1/3 of scallions.
