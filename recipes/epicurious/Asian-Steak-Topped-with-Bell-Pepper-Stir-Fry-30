Preheat oven to 375°F. Whisk chili sauce, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, and ginger in medium bowl; add steaks and turn to coat. Let marinate at room temperature 15 minutes, turning occasionally. Heat 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil in large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Scrape most of marinade off steaks and back into bowl. Sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper; add to skillet and cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Turn steaks over and transfer skillet to oven. Roast until cooked to desired doneness, about 5 minutes longer for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to cutting board; let rest 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and bell peppers; sauté until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Add green onions and all remaining marinade from steaks. Bring to boil. Stir in cilantro. Cut steaks crosswise in half. Divide steaks among 4 plates. Spoon vegetables over steaks and serve. *A sweet-hot Thai-style condiment used in marinades and sauces; available in the Asian foods section of some supermarkets and at Asian markets.
