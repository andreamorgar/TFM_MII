Pat chicken dry and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Heat oil in a deep 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then brown chicken in 2 batches, skin sides down first, turning over once, about 10 minutes per batch. Transfer chicken as browned to a plate. Add onion, carrot, celery, garlic, rosemary, and a pinch of salt to skillet, then reduce heat to moderate and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, about 8 minutes. Add wine and deglaze skillet by boiling, stirring and scraping up brown bits, until most of wine is evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, water, and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, then return chicken with any accumulated juices to skillet and turn over to coat with sauce. Turn chicken skin sides up and simmer, covered, until chicken is cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes.
