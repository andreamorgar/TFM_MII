Mix goat cheese and cilantro in medium bowl for filling. Cover; chill. Combine fresh masa or masa harina mixture, lard, and salt in large bowl. Knead until well blended, adding warm water by teaspoonfuls as needed until dough is soft but not sticky. Divide into 12 equal portions; shape each into ball. Arrange on sheet of foil; cover. Cut two 8-inch rounds from heavy-duty resealable plastic bag. Place 1 plastic round on bottom half of tortilla press. Place 1 dough ball in center; top with second plastic round. Close tortilla press, gently flattening dough to 4-inch round about 1/4 inch thick. Peel off top plastic. Arrange 2 tablespoons goat cheese filling in strip in center of dough round. Using bottom plastic as aid, fold up sides of dough over filling. Using moistened fingertips, mold dough into oval, sealing filling inside. Arrange, seam side down, on sheet of aluminum foil. Repeat with remaining masa balls and filling. Heat 2 heavy large ungreased griddles or skillets over medium heat. Arrange 6 cakes in each. Cook until cakes are pale golden, 8 minutes per side. Transfer masa cakes to baking sheet. (Masa cakes can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.) Pour vegetable oil into each griddle to depth of 1/8 inch. Heat over medium-high heat 2 minutes. Add 6 masa cakes to each griddle. Fry until masa cakes are heated through and golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Arrange masa cakes on platter. Spoon some tomatillo salsa over. Garnish with radishes. Serve with remaining salsa.
