Halve shrimp lengthwise by cutting down middle of backs and cook in a saucepan of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain in a colander and spread on a large plate to cool. Whisk together vinegar, garlic, ginger, and oil, then add shrimp and remaining ingredients and toss to combine well. Season salad with salt and pepper. These long, narrow cucumbers are often marketed as "European" and are usually sold in plastic wrap to protect their thin, delicate, unwaxed skin.
