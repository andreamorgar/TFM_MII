Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400°F. Place baking sheet on rack. Let pie crusts stand at room temperature 15 minutes. Combine apples, sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, orange peel, Grand Marnier and cinnamon in large bowl; mix to blend well. Unfold pie crusts. Press out fold lines. Brush 1 crust with remaining teaspoon flour. Place crust floured side down in 9-inch deep-dish glass pie plate. Spoon apple filling into crust-lined dish. Dot filling with butter. Arrange second crust over filling. Seal and crimp edges. Cut 5 slits in top crust for steam vents. Place pie on baking sheet in oven. Bake until crust is golden brown and apples are tender, about 50 minutes. Cool pie on rack at least 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
