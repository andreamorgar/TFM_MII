In a kettle cook the onion in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until it is softened, add the wine, the clam juice, and the water, and bring the mixture to a boil. Add the mussels, steam them, covered, for 2 minutes, or until they are opened, transferring them with tongs as they open to a bowl, and discard any that are unopened. Let the mussels cool until they can be handled and remove them from their shells, discarding the shell. Boil the liquid remaining in the kettle until it is reduced to about 1 cup, add the cream, and simmer the sauce, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes, or until it is thickened. Stir in the arugula, the mussels with any liquid that has accumulated in the bowl, and salt and pepper to taste. In a kettle of boiling salted water boil the linguine until it is al dente, drain it well, and transfer it to a large bowl. Add the mussel mixture and toss the mixture well.
