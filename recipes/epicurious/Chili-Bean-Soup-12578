Place beans in large bowl. Pour enough cold water over to cover beans by 2-inches. Let stand overnight. Drain. Heat oil in heavy large Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Add onion, bell pepper, celery, garlic and bay leaf; stir to coat with oil. Cover and cook until vegetables are tender and light golden, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Uncover; add chili powder and cumin and stir 1 minute. Add beans, 4 cups water, tomatoes and cayenne; bring to boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until beans are tender, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Uncover soup; season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring soup to simmer before continuing.) Discard bay leaf. Ladle soup into bowls. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon cheese over each bowl and serve.
