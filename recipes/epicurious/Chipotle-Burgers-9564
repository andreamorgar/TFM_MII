Prepare grill for cooking over medium-hot charcoal (moderate heat for gas); see "Grilling Procedure," below. Meanwhile, open any whole chipotles and discard seeds, then mince chipotles. Mix chipotles (with sauce), beef, onion, and salt with your hands, then form mixture into 4 (3/4-inch-thick) patties. Grill burgers on lightly oiled grill rack, covered only if using gas grill, turning over once, 4 minutes total for medium-rare. Grill English muffins, cut sides down, until grill marks appear, about 30 seconds. Serve burgers in English muffins. If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light charcoal. When charcoal turns grayish white (about 15 minutes from lighting), hold your hand 5 inches above grill rack to determine heat for charcoal as follows: Hot: When you can hold your hand there for 1 to 2 seconds Medium-hot: 3 to 4 seconds Low: 5 to 6 seconds If using a gas grill, preheat burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then, if necessary, reduce to heat specified in recipe.
