Combine yolks, 1/2 cup cream, 1/3 cup sugar, molasses, rum, liqueur and instant coffee in medium stainless steel bowl. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not let bottom of bowl touch water.) Using handheld electric mixer, beat yolk mixture until thick and thermometer registers 160°F, about 18 minutes. Remove from over water; continue beating until zabaglione is cool, about 4 minutes. Using same beaters, beat 1 cup cream and vanilla in medium bowl until medium-firm peaks form. Fold cream into zabaglione in 2 additions. Cover and chill until thickened, about 4 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.) Preheat broiler. Place banana chunks on baking sheet. Push 1/3 cup brown sugar through sieve onto bananas, coating evenly. Place close to heat; broil until sugar melts and crisps on bananas. Spoon 1/4 cup zabaglione into each of six 1 1/4- to 1 1/2-cup goblets. Spoon bananas over, dividing equally. Sprinkle each with 1 rounded tablespoon crushed gingersnaps. Top each with 1/4 cup zabaglione. Garnish each with gingersnap, banana slice and mint, if desired.
