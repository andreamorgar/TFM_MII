In a small heavy saucepan stir together all ingredients except sesame seeds and cook over very low heat, stirring occasionally, 20 minutes. Cook, stirring frequently so mixture does not burn, 40 minutes more, or until very thick. Remove pan from heat and let mixture cool slightly. Form tablespoons of warm mixture into 1-inch balls and roll in sesame seeds to coat. Candies may be made 1 week ahead and kept in an airtight coriander in a cool dark place.
