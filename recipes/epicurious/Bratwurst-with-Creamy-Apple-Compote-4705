Preheat broiler. Heat butter and oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until foam subsides, then cook onion and apples with bay leaf, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, stirring once or twice, until golden brown, about 6 minutes. Meanwhile, split bratwurst lengthwise (not all the way through) and open up. Lightly brush cut sides of bratwurst with additional oil and transfer to a shallow baking pan (split sides up). Add wine to apple mixture, then simmer, covered, until apples are tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove lid and briskly simmer until liquid is reduced by one third, about 2 minutes. While apples simmer, broil bratwurst 4 to 5 inches from heat until browned, about 6 minutes. Stir cream, vinegar, and brown sugar into apple mixture and briskly simmer until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Discard bay leaf and serve apple compote over bratwurst.
