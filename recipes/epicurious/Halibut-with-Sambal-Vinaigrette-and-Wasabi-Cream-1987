Preheat oven to 400°F. Blend vinaigrette ingredients in a blender until smooth. Season with salt. Whisk together wasabi powder and water until smooth, then whisk in sour cream. Season with salt. Pat fish dry and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle 1 side of each piece with parsley. Heat a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over high heat until hot. Add oil, then fish, parsleyed sides up. Sear fish until undersides are browned, about 1 minute. Turn fish over and put skillet in middle of oven. Roast until just cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Serve fish, parsleyed sides up, with a spoonful of each sauce.
