Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Mix first 6 ingredients in medium bowl. Season salsa with salt and pepper. Whisk oil and chili powder in small bowl. Arrange zucchini, fish, and tortillas in single layer on large baking sheet. Brush chili oil on both sides of zucchini, fish, and tortillas. Sprinkle zucchini and fish with salt and pepper. Grill until fish is cooked through, zucchini is tender, and tortillas begin to crisp, about 3 minutes per side for fish and zucchini, and 2 minutes per side for tortillas. Divide zucchini among tortillas. Cut fish into strips and place atop zucchini. Top with salsa and serve.
