In a saucepan, cook the butter and flour to form a sandy roux. In a separate pan, bring the milk and sugar to a boil, then add them to the roux. Cook until a smooth paste forms. Cool slightly, then whisk in the egg yolks. Add the melted chocolate and cocoa. Whip the egg whites to stiff, glossy peaks and immediately fold them into the base. Pour the mixture into buttered, sugared individual-size ramekins (about 1/2 inch from the top). Bake at 375°F for 20 minutes. Serve with a dusting of powdered sugar (or fresh whipped cream).
