In a blender blend together 1/3 cup of the sugar, the flour, the eggs, the milk, the vanilla, and the salt until the mixture is smooth. Arrange the banana slices in one layer in a buttered 3-cup gratin dish or flameproof shallow baking dish, pour the pudding over them, and bake the clafouti in the middle of a preheated 400°F. oven for 20 minutes, or until the top is puffed and springy to the touch. Sprinkle the top with the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar, dot it with the butter, and broil the clafouti under a preheated broiler about 3 inches from the heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until it is browned.
