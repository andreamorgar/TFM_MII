Cut each baguette in half lengthwise and then in half widthwise (you will now have 4 top and 4 bottom slices). Distribute pear slices evenly over the 4 bottom slices of bread. Crumble walnut pieces evenly over the pears. Crumble gorgonzola evenly over the pear-walnut combination. Place top half of bread on each of the bottom halves. Wrap in foil and place in 350°F. oven for 3-5 minutes or until cheese melts.
