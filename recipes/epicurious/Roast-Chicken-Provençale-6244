Transfer chicken to a cutting board and keep warm, loosely covered. While chicken is roasting, finely chop onion and garlic separately. Seed tomatoes and cut into 1/4-inch dice. Pit olives and finely slice. Chop enough basil to measure 2 tablespoons and cut remaining leaves into thin strips. Pour off all but 2 teaspoons fat from skillet and sauté onion over moderately high heat, stirring, 30 seconds. Add garlic and sauté, stirring, 30 seconds. Add wine and deglaze skillet, scraping up brown bits. Simmer mixture until reduced by about half. Add stock and return mixture to a simmer. Add tomato and olives and simmer until sauce is slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Stir in basil strips and remove pan from heat. Cut chicken into 4 serving pieces. Pour sauce over chicken and sprinkle with chopped basil.
