Season cabbage wedges with salt, then steam in a steamer rack set over boiling water, covered, until tender, about 15 minutes. While cabbage is steaming, cook bacon in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp-tender, about 12 minutes. Transfer bacon with a slotted spoon to a plate and reserve rendered fat in a small bowl. Wipe out skillet with a paper towel and return 3 tablespoons bacon fat to skillet. Cut sausages in half lengthwise and cook, cut sides down, over moderately low heat until browned and heated through, about 7 minutes. Transfer sausages with tongs to a plate and keep warm, covered. Add onion to skillet and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until beginning to soften, about 6 minutes. Add sausages and bacon and cook, stirring, until heated through. Add vinegar and remove from heat, then stir in butter. Serve cabbage wedges topped with sausages, onion, and sauce.
