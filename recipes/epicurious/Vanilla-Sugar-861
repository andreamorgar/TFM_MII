Blend sugar and vanilla bean in processor until bean is finely ground. Store in covered container at room temperature at least 2 days, then strain through fine strainer before using. Vanilla sugar will keep for several months. Use the leftovers in other baked goods, in your morning cup of coffee, or sprinkled over yogurt.
