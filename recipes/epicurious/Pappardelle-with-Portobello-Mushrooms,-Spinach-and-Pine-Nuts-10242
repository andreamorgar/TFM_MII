Meanwhile, place mushrooms on baking sheet. Brush with 4 tablespoons oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Broil mushrooms until lightly charred and tender, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to cutting board. Cut each mushroom into 4 wedges. Set aside. Drain pasta, reserving 1/2 cup cooking liquid. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add blanched garlic and sauté until golden, about 2 minutes. Add spinach and mushrooms; sauté until heated through, about 2 minutes. Add pasta and 1/2 cup cheese to spinach mixture; toss will. Add enough reserved pasta cooking liquid to moisten pasta, if necessary. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with pine nuts. Serve, passing additional cheese separately.
