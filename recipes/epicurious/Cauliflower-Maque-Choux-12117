Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 450°F. Toss cauliflower with oil, kosher salt, and pepper in a bowl. Spread in 1 layer in a shallow (1-inch-deep) baking pan and roast, turning over with tongs halfway through roasting, until golden brown and tender, 20 to 25 minutes total. Transfer cauliflower with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, then carefully pour oil from baking pan through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl. While cauliflower roasts, bring hominy and cream just to a simmer in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, then remove from heat and let stand, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat butter and 2 tablespoons strained oil in a 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat until foam subsides, then cook ham (if using), stirring, 2 minutes. Add onion and bell peppers and cook, stirring, until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, red pepper flakes, and bay leaf and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add vinegar and stock and simmer briskly, uncovered, until liquid is reduced by about half, 12 to 15 minutes. Stir in hominy mixture and corn and simmer, uncovered, 2 minutes. Add cauliflower and salt to taste and simmer, stirring once or twice, until heated through, about 2 minutes. Stir in parsley.
