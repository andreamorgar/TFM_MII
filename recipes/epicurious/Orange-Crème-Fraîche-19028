Bring whipping cream and orange peel to simmer in heavy small saucepan over medium heat. Pour into medium bowl. Place bowl inside large bowl of ice water to chill quickly. Whisk in crème fraîche. Refrigerate until mixture is very cold, at least 1 hour. Add sugar and whisk until firm peaks form. Cover and chill up to 3 hours. Rewhip, if necessary. *Sold at some supermarkets. If unavailable, heat 1/2 cup whipping cream to lukewarm (85°F). Remove from heat and mix in 1 tablespoon buttermilk. Cover and let stand in warm draft-free area until slightly thickened, 24 to 48 hours, depending on temperature of room. Cover and refrigerate up to 2 days.
