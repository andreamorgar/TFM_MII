1. Combine the wine, soy sauce, garlic, pepper and 8 tablespoons parsley. Pour over lamb in a shallow dish. Refrigerate, covered, 6 hours or overnight, turning the lamb frequently. Remove lamb; reserve marinade. 2. Grill lamb 4 inches above hot coals, about 20 minutes on each side, basting frequently. Check for doneness frequently after 30 minutes of grilling. Cut into thin slices on the diagonal, arrange on a platter and serve immediately, sprinkled with the remaining parsley.
