Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water 3 minutes. Add broccoli rabe and boil until broccoli rabe is just crisp-tender and pasta is just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes longer. Drain pasta and broccoli rabe, reserving 1/2 cup cooking liquid. Return pasta and broccoli rabe to pot. Meanwhile, bring vegetable broth and crushed red pepper to simmer in medium saucepan. Add beans and simmer until beans are heated through, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes. Add bean mixture, pesto, and vinegar to pasta and broccoli rabe. Stir well, adding pasta cooking liquid by tablespoonfuls if necessary. Season with salt and pepper. Serve in shallow bowls.
