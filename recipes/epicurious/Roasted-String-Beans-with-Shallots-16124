Preheat the oven to 400°F. Toss the beans and shallots with the oil and salt on a baking sheet. Roast, stirring twice during roasting, until the shallots have caramelized and the beans are beginning to brown and wilt, about 25 minutes. Sprinkle with pepper and serve hot. Substitute asparagus and roast about 10 minutes.
