Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss shallots with oil and 3 teaspoons thyme on small rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake until golden, about 25 minutes. Mix 1 tablespoon vinegar and 1 tablespoon sugar in small bowl. Drizzle over shallots; toss to coat. Continue roasting until shallots caramelize, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven. Bring Port, brown sugar, 4 tablespoons vinegar, and 1/2 cup sugar to boil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Add cranberries and currants; cook until berries pop, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Mix in marjoram and 2 teaspoons thyme. Mix in shallots. Transfer to bowl. Cover and chill overnight. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Keep refrigerated.) Serve cold or at room temperature.
