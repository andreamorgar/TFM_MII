Add wine and bring to a boil. In a measuring cup vigorously stir together milk and flour and add to mushroom mixture with cream and cayenne. Simmer cream mixture, stirring occasionally, until mixture is slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Toast bread. Add oysters and parsley to cream mixture, stirring gently, and cook at a bare simmer until edges of oysters curl, about 3 minutes.
