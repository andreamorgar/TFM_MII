Make 6 crêpes (procedure follows) with the toasted coconut crêpe batter. Fit the crêpes into 1/2-cup muffin tins and put a ball of foil in the center of each cup to keep the crêpes open. Bake the cups in a preheated 400°F. oven for 4 minutes, remove the foil, and bake the cups for 6 to 8 minutes more, or until they are crisp. In a skillet sauté the pineapple in the butter over moderately high heat, stirring, for 3 minutes, add the rum carefully, and boil the mixture for 3 minutes. Put a scoop of vanilla ice cream in each crêpe cup, spoon some of the pineapple sauce over it, and sprinkle the tops with the toasted coconut. In a blender or food processor blend the flour, the sugar, 1/2 cup water, the milk, the egg, the butter, the salt, and the almond extract for 5 seconds. Turn off the motor, with a rubber spatula scrape down the sides of the container, and blend the batter for 20 seconds more. Transfer the batter to a bowl, stir in the coconut, and let the batter stand, covered, for 1 hour. The batter may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled. Makes enough batter for about 6 crêpes. Heat a crêpe pan or non-stick skillet measuring 6 to 7 inches across the bottom over moderate heat until it is hot. Brush the pan lightly with the butter, heat it until it is hot but not smoking, and remove it from the heat. Stir the batter, half fill a 1/4-cup measure with it, and pour the batter into the pan. Tilt and rotate the pan quickly to cover the bottom with a thin layer of batter and return any excess batter to the bowl. Return the pan to the heat, loosen the edge of the crêpe with a spatula, and cook the crêpe for 1 minute, or until the top appears almost dry. Turn the crêpe, cook the other side lightly, and transfer the crêpe to a plate. Make crêpes with the remaining batter in the same manner, brushing the pan lightly with butter as necessary. The crêpes may be made 3 days in advance, kept stacked, wrapped in plastic wrap, and chilled.
