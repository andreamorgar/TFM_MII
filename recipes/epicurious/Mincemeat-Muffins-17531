Preheat oven to 400°F and grease twelve 1/2-cup muffin cups. Finely chop pecans. Peel apple and cut into 1/4-inch dice. In a bowl whisk together egg, juice, and oil and stir in mincemeat and apple. Into a large bowl sift together flour, baking powder, and cinnamon and whisk in sugar. Add mincemeat mixture and pecans and stir batter until just combined. Divide batter among muffin cups and bake in middle of oven 20 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Turn muffins out onto a rack and cool 5 minutes. In a small bowl whisk together confectioners' sugar, cinnamon, and 3 teaspoons juice until smooth, adding enough of remaining teaspoon if necessary to make a spreadable glaze. Spread glaze over tops of warm muffins. Serve muffins warm or at room temperature. Muffins may be made 3 days ahead and kept in an airtight container at room temperature.
