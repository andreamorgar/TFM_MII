Heat 2 tablespoons oil reserved from sun-dried tomatoes in heavy large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add garlic and savory and stir 1 minute. Add broth and sun-dried tomatoes. Increase heat to high and bring to boil. Add pasta, cover and boil until pasta is almost tender, about 5 minutes. Mix in cannellini and peppers. Reduce heat; simmer uncovered until pasta is just tender but still firm to bite, about 4 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.
