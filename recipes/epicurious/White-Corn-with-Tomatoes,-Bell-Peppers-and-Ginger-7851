Heat olive oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add chopped onion, chopped celery and chopped green bell peppers and sauté until vegetables begin to soften, about 7 minutes. Add tomatoes and 1/2 cup reserved juice and bring to simmer. Add corn. Reduce heat to medium, cover and simmer 15 minutes. Mix in ginger, lemon peel and black pepper. Cover and simmer until vegetables are soft and corn is tender but not mushy, adding more reserved tomato juice if mixture is dry, about 10 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt.
