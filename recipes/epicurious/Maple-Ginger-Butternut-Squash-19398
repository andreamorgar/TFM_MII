Preheat oven to 400°F. Halve squash and discard seeds. Arrange squash, cut sides up, in a shallow baking pan and roast in middle of oven until soft, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool squash slightly and scoop flesh into a bowl. Mash squash slightly with a fork with syrup, ginger, and salt and pepper to taste. Before serving, reheat squash if necessary in a baking dish, covered, in a 350°F oven.
