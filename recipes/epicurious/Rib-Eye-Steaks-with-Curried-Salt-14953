Stir together salt and curry powder. Pat steaks dry and sprinkle both sides evenly with curried salt. Heat a well-seasoned 10-inch cast-iron skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sear steaks 4 to 5 minutes on each side, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted horizontally into thickest part of meat registers 130°F for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to a plate and let stand 5 minutes. Add water to skillet and deglaze pan by boiling, scraping up brown bits, until reduced to about 2 tablespoons. Spoon juices over meat.
