Halve figs lengthwise, discarding stems. In a dry 3-quart heavy saucepan cook sugar over moderately low heat, stirring slowly with a fork (to help sugar melt evenly), until melted and pale golden. Cook caramel, without stirring, gently swirling pan, until deep golden. Remove pan from heat and carefully pour water down side of pan (mixture will vigorously steam and caramel will harden). Add figs, vinegar, butter, and mustard and simmer, stirring, until caramel is dissolved and figs are softened, about 6 minutes. Sauce keeps, covered and chilled, 1 week. Reheat sauce before serving.
