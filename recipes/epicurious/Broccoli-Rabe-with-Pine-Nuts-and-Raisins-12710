In extra-large skillet over medium heat, heat olive oil. Add pine nuts and toast, stirring constantly, until fragrant and just barely golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Add garlic and sauté 1 minute more. Add broccoli rabe, sherry, and golden raisins and cover pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until broccoli rabe is tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Season with kosher or coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper and serve.
