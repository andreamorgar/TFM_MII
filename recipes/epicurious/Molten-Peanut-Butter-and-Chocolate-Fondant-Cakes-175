Preheat oven to 400°F. Place the chocolate and butter in a saucepan over low heat and stir until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Place the eggs, egg yolks and sugar in a bowl and whisk until well combined. Add the chocolate mixture and flour and whisk until well combined. Spoon two-thirds of the mixture into 4 (1-cup) well-greased dariole molds or other 1-cup baking molds. Spoon 2 tablespoons peanut butter into the center of each mold and spoon the remaining chocolate mixture over. Place the molds on a baking sheet and bake for 16–18 minutes or until puffed. Gently turn out the cakes immediately and dust with cocoa powder to serve.
