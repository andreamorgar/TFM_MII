Preheat oven to 350°F. Wrap garlic clove in foil and roast until soft, 30 to 35 minutes. Unwrap and let cool. Peel cloves and place in blender. Add olive oil and blend until emulsified. Spread baguette slices on baking sheet. Lightly brush each slice with roasted garlic oil. Bake until golden brown, 13 to 15 minutes. In large non-stick pan over moderately high heat, heat olive oil until hot but not smoking. Add garlic and chile and sauté until garlic begins to turn golden brown around edges, 3 to 4 minutes. Add shrimp and sauté in 2 batches, turning, until golden brown and just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to large bowl, sprinkle with lemon juice, and toss with parsley. Serve warm with garlic toasts.
