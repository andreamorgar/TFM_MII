On a small plate with a fork, blend together well chipotle butter ingredients and chill. Chipotle butter may be made 5 days ahead and chilled, wrapped tightly. Preheat oven to 400°F. On a work surface arrange 1 parchment square and put 3/4 cup black beans and 3 tomato slices in center. Top tomato and beans with 1 piece of scrod or cod. Top the fish with 8 olive halves, about one sixth of onion slices, 2 tablespoons wine, 2 teaspoons lime juice, 1 oregano sprig and about one sixth of chipotle butter and season well with salt and black pepper. Gather sides of parchment up over fish to form a large sack and gently squeeze middle of sack together to form a waist. Tie one piece of string tightly but gently around waist of sack and transfer sack to a large shallow baking pan. Make 5 more sacks in same manner with remaining parchment squares and ingredients. Bake sacks in lower third of oven (being careful that tops of sacks do not touch heating element) 15 to 20 minutes, or until fish is cooked through. Divide sacks among 6 plates and at table snip strings with scissors. In a bowl mix together black bean ingredients with salt and pepper to taste. Black beans may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Season beans with salt and pepper before using.
