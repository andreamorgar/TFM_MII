Cut a paper-thin slice off both ends of eggs and halve eggs crosswise. In a small food processor blend yolks, salmon, cream cheese, sour cream, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste until smooth. Add minced dill and process until mixture is just combined. Transfer filling to a pastry bag fitted with a large leaf or other decorative tip. Just before serving, pipe filling into whites, mounding it, and garnish eggs.
