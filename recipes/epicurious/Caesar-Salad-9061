Season salad bowl by rubbing a cut half of garlic followed by 1 teaspoon oil onto bottom and side of bowl (reserve garlic). Heat 3/4 cup oil with both halves of reserved garlic in an 8-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat, turning garlic occasionally, until golden, 1 to 2 minutes, then discard garlic. Add bread cubes to oil and fry, turning occasionally, until golden on all sides, about 2 minutes. Transfer croutons to paper towels to drain. Pour oil through a small fine-mesh sieve into a heatproof measuring cup and add enough additional olive oil to bring total to 6 tablespoons. Put anchovies in salad bowl and mash to a paste using 2 forks. Whisk in egg and lemon juice, then add reserved oil (warm or at room temperature) in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified. Season with salt to taste. Add romaine leaves to dressing and toss to coat. Add croutons and toss briefly. Divide salad among 6 large plates, then sprinkle with cheese and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
