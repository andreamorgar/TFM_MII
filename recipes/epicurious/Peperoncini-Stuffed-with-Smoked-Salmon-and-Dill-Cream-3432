Trim the stem ends off the peperoncini at an angle and, wearing rubber gloves, discard the seeds and ribs. Let the peperoncini drain on paper towels. In a bowl cream the cream cheese with the butter until the mixture is smooth, add the dill, the shallot, and the lemon juice, and combine the mixture well. Stir in the salmon and salt and pepper to taste, transfer the mixture to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch decorative or plain tip, and pipe the smoked salmon and dill cream into the peperoncini. The peperoncini may be prepared 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled.
