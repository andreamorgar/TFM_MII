Add the olive oil, lemon zest, and chopped chiles to a small pan and place over low heat until they begin to sizzle. Remove from the heat and set aside. Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add the linguine and cook according to the package instructions (about 7 minutes). Drain well, rinse with boiling water, and set aside. Add the chile and lemon oil to the pan that the linguine was cooked in. Add the lemon juice and cook over medium heat until sizzling. Return the linguine to the pan and add the crab meat. Toss gently for 1 to 2 minutes to warm the crab through. Fold in the basil and season with crushed sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spoon into warmed serving bowls.
