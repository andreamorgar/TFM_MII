Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite. Drain; reserve 3/4 cup pasta cooking liquid. Simmer cream and lemon peel in heavy large skillet over medium heat until slightly reduced, about 1 minute. Stir in peas, prosciutto, wine, and lemon juice. Simmer 2 minutes. Add pasta and cheese and toss to coat, adding enough pasta cooking liquid to moisten. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
