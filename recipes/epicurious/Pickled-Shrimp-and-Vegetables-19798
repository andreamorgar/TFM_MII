Cook carrots in medium saucepan of boiling salted water until just tender, about 7 minutes. Drain. Place carrots in large glass bowl; add peas and chilies. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add shrimp and crushed garlic cloves; sauté until shrimp are just opaque in center, about 8 minutes. Discard garlic. Peel shrimp; add to glass bowl. Heat remaining 1/4 cup oil in same large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and sauté until translucent, about 8 minutes; add to bowl. Combine 3/4 cup water, next 9 ingredients and sliced garlic in heavy medium saucepan. Bring to boil over medium-high heat, stirring until salt dissolves. Pour hot spice mixture over shrimp mixture and stir to blend well. Let stand 2 hours. Chill at least 2 hours and up to 1 day, stirring occasionally. Arrange 4 shrimp and some vegetables on each plate. Garnish with fresh herb sprigs, if desired, and serve.
