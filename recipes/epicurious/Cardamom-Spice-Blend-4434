Combine all the spices in a dry medium skillet over medium heat and heat, shaking the pan continuously to prevent burning, until the spices are fragrant and just beginning to smoke, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the spices to a bowl to cool. Use immediately, or store in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for up to 2 months.
