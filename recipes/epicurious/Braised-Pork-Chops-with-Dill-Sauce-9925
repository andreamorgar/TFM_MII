In a skillet heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking, in it brown the pork chops, patted dry and seasoned with salt and pepper, and pour of the excess fat. Add the milk to the skillet, bring it to a simmer, and braise the pork chops, covered, over moderately low heat for 25 minutes, or until they are tender. (The milk will appear curdled.) Transfer the chops to a plate and keep them warm, covered. Stir the cornstarch mixture, stir it into the milk, and bring the sauce to a boil, stirring. In a blender blend the sauce until it is smooth and stir in the dill. Transfer the pork chops to 2 plates and pour the sauce over them.
