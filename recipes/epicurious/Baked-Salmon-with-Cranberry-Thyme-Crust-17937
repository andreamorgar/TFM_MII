Preheat oven to 375°F. Oil baking sheet. Sprinkle salmon with salt and pepper. Place skin side down on sheet. Combine panko, cranberries, onion, 2 tablespoons melted butter, thyme, and lemon peel in medium bowl; blend well. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon onto salmon, dividing equally. Press to adhere. Drizzle with remaining melted butter. Bake until topping is golden and salmon is just opaque in center, about 20 minutes.
