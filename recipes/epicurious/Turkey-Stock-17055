Heat vegetable oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add turkey wings, neck, heart and gizzard to pot and sauté until brown, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes. Using tongs, transfer turkey parts to large bowl. Add onion, carrot and celery to same pot; sauté 2 minutes. Return turkey parts and any juices to pot. Add 16 cups water. Bring liquid to boil. Skim off foam. Add parsley, thyme and peppercorns. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until liquid is reduced to 10 cups, about 2 hours 15 minutes. Strain stock into bowl. Let stand 5 minutes; spoon off fat. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cool slightly. Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled.)
