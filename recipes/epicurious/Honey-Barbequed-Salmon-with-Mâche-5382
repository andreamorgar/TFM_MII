In a heavy saucepan stir together sauce ingredients and simmer, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes. (Sauce keeps, covered and chilled, 1 week.) In a small bowl whisk together dressing ingredients with salt and pepper to taste until combined well. Chill dressing 15 minutes. Brush both sides of each salmon fillet with about 1/3 cup sauce and grill on a well-oiled rack set about 4 to 5 inches over glowing coals 3 minutes on each side, or until salmon just flakes. Divide mâche among 6 plates and top with salmon. Spoon dressing over salmon.
