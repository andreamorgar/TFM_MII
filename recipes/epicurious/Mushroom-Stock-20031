Quarter mushrooms and in a food processor finely chop in 4 batches, transferring to a 6-quart stockpot or heavy kettle. Finely chop onions and add to mushrooms with water and salt. Simmer mixture, uncovered, 2 hours. Pour stock through a large fine sieve into a large bowl, pressing hard on solids. Yield should be about 5 cups: If yield is less, add enough water to make 5 cups; if more, boil stock until reduced to 5 cups.
