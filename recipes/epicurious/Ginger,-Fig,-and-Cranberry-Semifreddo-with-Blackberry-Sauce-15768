Line 9x5x3-inch metal loaf pan with plastic wrap, extending over sides by 3 inches. Whisk egg yolks, sugar and white wine in medium metal bowl to blend. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water; whisk egg mixture constantly until candy thermometer registers 160°F, about 5 minutes. Remove from over water. Using electric mixer, beat until cool and thick, about 5 minutes. Beat in orange peel. Beat chilled whipping cream in large bowl until peaks form. Add egg mixture and gently fold together.

Drizzle Blackberry Sauce over each slice and serve.
