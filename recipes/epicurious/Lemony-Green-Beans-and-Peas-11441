Add green beans to a 3- to 4-quart pot of very well salted boiling water, and cook, uncovered, until barely tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in peas and cook, uncovered, until beans and peas are tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Meanwhile, put butter and zest in a large bowl. Drain vegetables in a sieve and add to bowl. Toss until well coated with butter and zest. Season with salt and pepper.
