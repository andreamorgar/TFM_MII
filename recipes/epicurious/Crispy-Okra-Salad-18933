In small mixing bowl, stir together onion, tomato, and cilantro. Refrigerate until ready to use. In wide, 4-inch-deep heavy pot over moderate heat, heat 1 1/2 to 2 inches oil until deep-fat thermometer registers 350°F. Fry okra in batches (returning oil to 350°F between batches) until golden brown, about 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer fried okra to paper towels to drain. In large mixing bowl, combine okra, onion-tomato mixture, lemon juice, salt, and chaat masala. Toss gently and serve immediately.
