Preheat oven to 400°F. Cook onion in butter in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add spinach and cook, covered, stirring 2 or 3 times, until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove lid and cook, stirring, until excess liquid is evaporated, 2 to 4 minutes. Add cream, salt, and pepper and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Arrange buttered ramekins in a shallow baking pan and divide spinach among them. Make an indentation in center of each and carefully crack an egg into each indentation. Bake in middle of oven until whites are just set, about 15 minutes. Serve eggs in ramekins with bacon and toast.
