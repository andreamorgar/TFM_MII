Preheat broiler. Toss together bell peppers, shiitakes, oil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl, then arrange in 1 layer in a 17- by 12-inch shallow baking pan. Broil 2 to 3 inches from heat until peppers begin to brown on edges, about 8 minutes. Turn vegetables over and broil until lightly charred, about 6 minutes more. Transfer to a clean bowl and toss with pesto. Leave broiler on. Halve baguette crosswise, then lengthwise. Spread cheese over cut side of each piece. Transfer to a baking sheet and broil 2 to 3 inches from heat until cheese is golden brown in spots, 2 to 3 minutes. Toss vegetables with frisée, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Serve salad with goat cheese toasts.
