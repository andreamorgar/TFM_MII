If necessary, gently pound each cutlet between 2 sheets of plastic wrap to 1/8-inch thickness with flat side of a meat pounder or with a rolling pin. Pat dry and season with salt and pepper. Heat butter and oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides. Meanwhile, dredge cutlets in flour, shaking off excess. Sauté cutlets in 2 batches (without crowding) until edges are golden and meat is just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer with tongs to a platter and loosely cover with foil to keep warm. Add Marsala to skillet and deglaze by boiling, stirring and scraping up brown bits. Stir in cream and mustard and boil, stirring occasionally, until sauce is slightly thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in parsley and salt and pepper to taste. Pour sauce over veal.
