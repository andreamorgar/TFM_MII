Blend olives, capers, garlic, zest, and 3 tablespoons artichoke marinade in a blender, scraping down sides frequently, until as smooth as possible, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer mixture to a bowl and stir in mayonnaise. Stir together artichokes and tuna in another bowl. Split each roll horizontally and remove inner crumb from top half. Spread olive mayonnaise on cut sides of rolls and make sandwiches with tuna and artichokes, seasoning filling with pepper and topping with parsley.
