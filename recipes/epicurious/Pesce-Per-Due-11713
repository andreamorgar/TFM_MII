Preheat oven to 400°F. In a bowl, combine the sea salt and the egg whites and mix well. The mixture should feel like wet sand. Rinse and pat fish dry. Stuff the cavity of the fish with the rosemary, parsley stems, garlic, and lemon slices. Sprinkle baking tray with sea salt. Trim a piece of parchment paper in the shape of the branzino, making the paper 1 inch larger all around than the fish. Place the fish on the parchment-lined tray and cover with the salt mixture, packing down tightly. Place the tray in the oven and cook for 17 to 19 minutes. (When done, the salt should be golden brown around the edges.)
