Heat oil in heavy small skillet over medium-low heat. Add green onion, rosemary, thyme and sage and sauté until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat. Place dough in medium bowl. Add herb mixture and pepper and knead until combined. Grease 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch loaf pan. Pat dough into rectangle, roll up into loaf shape and place in prepared pan, seam side down. Cover and let rise in warm draft-free area, until doubled, 45 minutes or less. Preheat oven to 375°F. Bake bread until golden brown and loaf sounds hollow when tapped on bottom, about 25 minutes. Turn bread out onto rack and cool completely before serving.
