Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Cook garlic, bay leaf, fennel seeds, and zest, stirring, until fennel seeds are golden, about 1 minute. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until pale golden, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, then add tomatoes with their juice, artichokes, and olives and cook, covered, until vegetables are tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Discard bay leaf and zest. Meanwhile, heat grill pan over medium-high heat until hot. Cut lamb across the grain into 4 (1-inch-thick) steaks. Brush both sides of steaks with remaining 2 tablespoons oil and season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper (total). Grill lamb, turning once, about 10 minutes total for medium-rare. Spoon tomato mixture onto plates and top with lamb.
