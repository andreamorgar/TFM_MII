Peel and chop gingerroot. In a blender combine gingerroot with remaining marinade ingredients and blend until smooth. Arrange sea bass in a 2-inch-deep dish just large enough to hold fish in one layer and pour marinade over it, turning fish to coat well. Marinate fish, covered and chilled, at least 2 hours and up to 2 days. Preheat oven to 400°F. and wrap handle of a 12-inch non-stick skillet with a triple-layer of foil, shiny side out, if handle is not ovenproof. Remove fish from marinade, letting excess marinade drip off, and put on a plate. Discard excess marinade. In non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sear fish on 1 side only until golden brown, about 3 minutes. With tongs turn fish over and transfer skillet to middle of oven. Roast fish until just cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Serve sea bass with curry sauce.
