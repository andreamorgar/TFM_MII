Wash escarole well in a sinkful of cold water, agitating it, then lift out and drain in a colander. Cook escarole in a 5- to 6-quart heavy pot of boiling salted water, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender, 5 to 10 minutes, then drain well in colander. Dry pot, then add oil and heat over moderate heat until hot but not smoking. Add pine nuts to hot oil and cook, stirring, until pale golden, about 1 minute. Add garlic and red-pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until garlic and pine nuts are golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Add escarole, stirring to coat with oil, then increase heat to moderately high and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of liquid is evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Season escarole with salt and pepper.
