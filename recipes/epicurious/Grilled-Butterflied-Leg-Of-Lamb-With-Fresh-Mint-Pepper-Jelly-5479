1. Make about 8 small incisions on the fatty side of the lamb and insert a smashed garlic half and some rosemary into each slit. Rub the lamb on both sides with the olive oil, Marsala, remaining garlic and rosemary, mint, salt, and pepper Cover and refrigerate overnight or let stand 1 hour at cool room temperature. 2. Brush the grill grates lightly with the safflower oil. Prepare a hot fire in a gas or charcoal grill. 3. If the lamb has been in the refrigerator, bring it to room temperature. Remove the meat from the marinade and drain slightly, allowing some of the marinade to remain on the lamb for added flavor. 4. When the fire is medium-hot (if using charcoal, the coals will be grey and slightly glowing), place the lamb on the grill and cook 15-20 minutes per side (depending on how hot the fire is), basting frequently with the remaining marinade. Move the lamb to the side of the grill away from the direct heat and continue to cook 10 to 15 minutes longer, turning once, or until the internal temperature registers 130 to 135 degrees for medium-rare and 140 to 145 degrees for medium 5. Remove the lamb from the grill and let rest, lightly covered, on a carving board 10 minutes before slicing. Carve into 1/4-inch slices and serve immediately with Foster's Seven Pepper Jelly with Fresh Mint. Makes 1 1/2 cups jelly Combine the jelly with the mint, vinegar, and pepper in a bowl and whisk until all ingredients are blended.
