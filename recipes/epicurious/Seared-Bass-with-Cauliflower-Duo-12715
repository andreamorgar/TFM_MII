Shave floret portion of cauliflower with a knife to create cauliflower "confetti" (3 to 4 cups). Set aside. With slicer, cut thin lengthwise slices from base and stem, dividing among 4 plates. Heat vegetable oil and 1/4 cup olive oil in a 12- to 14-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until oil shimmers, then fry cauliflower "confetti" in 4 batches, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 3 minutes per batch. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, seasoning lightly with salt. Discard oil and wipe out skillet. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in skillet over medium heat until it shimmers. Season fish with 1 tablespoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Sear, skin side down, 8 minutes. Turn fish and cook until just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk together remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, lemon juice, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Place fish, skin side up, on top of cauliflower slices. Top with cauliflower confetti and drizzle with vinaigrette.
