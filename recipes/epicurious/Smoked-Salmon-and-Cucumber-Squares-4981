Halve cucumber crosswise and thinly julienne lengthwise, preferably with a mandoline or other manual slicer, working around core. Discard core. Stir together sour cream, horseradish, and salt and pepper to taste. Divide bread into 4 stacks and cut stacks into 1 1/2-inch squares with a serrated knife, discarding crusts. Spoon 1/2 teaspoon sour cream onto center of each bread square, then top with a folded piece of salmon. Top salmon with a small amount of cucumber, twirled into a mound.
