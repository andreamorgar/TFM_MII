Mix flour, oats, sugar, cinnamon and salt in medium bowl. Rub in butter with fingertips until moist clumps form. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter 11 x 8 x 2-inch ovenproof dish (or another shallow 8-cup-capacity dish). Mix apples and next 5 ingredients in large bowl. Transfer to dish. Bake fruit 20 minutes. Remove from oven. Crumble topping over. Bake until apples are tender, juices bubble thickly around sides and topping is golden brown, about 35 minutes longer. Let stand at least 10 minutes and up to 1 hour. Serve with whipped cream.
