In a dry large deep heavy skillet cook the sugar over moderately high heat, stirring constantly with a fork, until it is melted completely and a deep golden caramel. Remove the skillet from the heat, into the side of the skillet carefully pour 1 cup hot water, a little at a time, and cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring, until the caramel is dissolved. Add the onions, the raisins, and the cranberries and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until the cranberries are tender. Remove the skillet from the heat, let the cranberry sauce mixture cool, and transfer it to a serving dish.
