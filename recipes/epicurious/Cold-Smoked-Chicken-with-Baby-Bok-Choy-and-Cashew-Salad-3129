Blanch bok choy in a 4- to 6-quart pot of boiling salted water until just wilted but still bright green, about 30 seconds. Drain in a colander, then rinse under cold water to stop cooking and drain well. Whisk together vinegar, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, pepper, and five-spice powder in a small bowl, then add oils in a slow stream, whisking until combined. Stir in sesame seeds. Toss together chicken, cucumber, cilantro, and 1/3 cup dressing in a bowl. Divide bok choy among 4 serving bowls and spoon chicken salad on top. Drizzle with some of remaining dressing and sprinkle with cashews. Transfer remaining dressing to an airtight container and chill for another use.
