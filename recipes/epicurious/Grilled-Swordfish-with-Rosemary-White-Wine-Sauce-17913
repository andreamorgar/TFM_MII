Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Brush fish with oil. Sprinkle with 2 teaspoons rosemary. Season with salt and pepper. Combine shallots, wine and lemon juice in small saucepan. Boil until liquid is reduced to 2 tablespoons, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Add remaining rosemary. Add 1 piece of butter; whisk until melted. Place pan over low heat; add remaining butter, 1 piece at a time, whisking until each piece melts before adding the next. Remove from heat. Season with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, grill fish until opaque in center, about 3 minutes per side. Serve with rosemary-white wine sauce.
