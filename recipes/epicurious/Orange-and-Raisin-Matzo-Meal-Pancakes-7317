Preheat oven to 300°F. Stir cottage cheese, egg yolks, and next 3 ingredients in large bowl. Mix in matzo meal and raisins (batter will be thick). Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in medium bowl to soft peaks. Gradually add sugar, beating until firm peaks form. Stir 1/3 of whites into batter. Fold in remaining whites in 2 additions. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Drop batter by 1/4 cupfuls into skillet. Cook pancakes until brown on bottom, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn over (pancakes will be soft). Cook until brown on bottom, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Transfer to nonstick baking sheet. Repeat with remaining butter and batter. Bake pancakes in oven until slightly firm to touch, about 5 minutes. Blend sour cream and honey in small bowl; serve with pancakes.
