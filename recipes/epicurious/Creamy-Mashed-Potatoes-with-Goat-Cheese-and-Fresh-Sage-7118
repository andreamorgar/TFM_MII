Cook potatoes in large saucepan of boiling salted water until tender, about 12 minutes; drain well. Return to same pan. Add cheese, 1/4 cup milk, and butter; mash until smooth. Mix in chopped sage; season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm over low heat, thinning with more milk, if too thick.) Mound potatoes in bowl. Garnish with fresh sage sprigs.
