Wash oranges; cut in half lengthwise. Cut halves into very thin slices; discard ends. Transfer oranges to large bowl. Cover with 1 quart water and chill overnight. Combine oranges with their soaking liquid, sugar, and pomegranate juice in nonreactive 4-quart pot. Bring to boil over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to medium; cook until mixture thickens, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour 40 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in pomegranate seeds. Pour marmalade into 3 half-pint jars. Cover and cool to room temperature. (Marmalade can be made 2 weeks ahead. Store in refrigerator.)
