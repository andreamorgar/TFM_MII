Line baking sheet with waxed paper. Place 1/2 cup breadcrumbs in shallow dish. Mix crabmeat, mayonnaise, 3 tablespoons chives, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, hot pepper sauce and remaining 1/4 cup breadcrumbs in medium bowl to blend. Season with salt and pepper. Mix in egg. Using 2 tablespoons for each, form crab mixture into twenty 1 1/2-inch-diameter cakes. Coat crab cakes with breadcrumbs in dish, pressing breadcrumbs to adhere. Transfer crab cakes to prepared baking sheet. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 6 hours. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat.
