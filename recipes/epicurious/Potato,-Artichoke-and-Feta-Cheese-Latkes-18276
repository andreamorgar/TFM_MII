Cook potatoes in pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 20 minutes. Drain. Cool completely and peel. Preheat oven to 325°F. Place baking sheet in oven. Using hand grater, coarsely grate potatoes into large bowl. Add artichokes and leek. Mix Parmesan, egg, mint, oregano, salt and pepper in small bowl. Add to potato mixture. Stir in feta and enough breadcrumbs to form mixture that holds together. Firmly press 1/2 cup mixture into 3 1/2-inch round. Repeat with remaining mixture. Heat 6 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium heat. Place 4 pancakes into skillet. Cook until brown, about 6 minutes per side. Transfer to sheet in oven. Repeat with remaining pancakes, adding more oil to skillet by tablespoonfuls as necessary. Serve hot.
