Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté until golden, about 5 minutes. Add chopped fresh tomatoes or canned tomatoes with juice; coarsely crush tomatoes with potato masher. Add 6 basil sprigs and dried crushed red pepper; bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until mixture is reduced to thick sauce consistency (about 3 cups), stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Season sauce to taste with coarse kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over medium heat before serving. Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Brush steaks and bread slices with olive oil. Sprinkle steaks with coarse kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Grill steaks to desired doneness, about 7 minutes per side for medium-rare. Grill bread slices until golden and grill marks appear, about 2 minutes per side. Spoon some of warm sauce onto 6 plates, then top each with 1 steak. Spoon additional sauce over each steak. Cut bread in half on diagonal; place bread alongside steaks. Garnish with additional basil sprigs and serve.
