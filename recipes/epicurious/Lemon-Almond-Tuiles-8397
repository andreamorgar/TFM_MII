Preheat oven to 375°F with rack in middle. Line a large baking sheet with liner. Whisk together sugar and egg white until sugar has dissolved. Whisk in remaining ingredients until smooth. Spoon 1/2 tablespoon of batter for each cookie, 2 inches apart and in staggered rows, on baking sheet (about 6 cookies), spreading with offset spatula into 4-inch-long cookies (straight or curvy). Bake until pale golden, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer cookies, while still hot, with a spatula to a rack to cool completely, or curl cookies by draping them over a rolling pin to cool. Cool sheet and liner before baking more tuiles in same manner.
