Using fork, mash avocado, lime juice, garlic and jalapeño in small bowl until almost smooth. Season guacamole with salt and pepper. Divide guacamole among all bread slices, spreading evenly (guacamole will be thinly spread). Place 5 tomato slices atop guacamole on each of 4 bread slices. Top each with 4 cucumber slices, then 2 onion slices, then cilantro. Top with remaining 4 bread slices, guacamole side down, pressing lightly. Cut sandwiches in half. (Can be prepared 3 hours ahead. Wrap in plastic; chill.)
