1. Arrange two slices of veal between two sheets of plastic wrap and use a mallet to gently pound them to about 1/4-inch thickness. Repeat with the remaining veal. Arrange two leaves of sage and two slices of prosciutto on each piece of veal, and press lightly to adhere. Lightly dust the prosciutto side of each piece of veal with a small amount of flour. 2. In a large sauté pan over moderately high heat, warm the olive oil. Working in batches if necessary, sauté the veal, prosciutto side down first, until the prosciutto is crispy and the veal is just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Set cooked pieces aside on a plate and cover with aluminum foil to keep them warm. 3. Remove any excess oil from the pan and deglaze the pan with the stock or broth. Add the butter to the pan and reduce by about one third until thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Return the meat to the pan and continue cooking to heat through as needed, about 1 minute. Serve the meat with the sauce spooned over top.
