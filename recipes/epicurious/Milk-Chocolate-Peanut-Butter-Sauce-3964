In a heavy saucepan melt the butter with the brown sugar and the corn syrup over moderate heat, stirring, whisk in the peanut butter and the half-and-half, and bring the mixture to a simmer. Add the chocolate and the salt, whisk the sauce until it is smooth, and whisk in the water. Serve the sauce warm over ice cream.
