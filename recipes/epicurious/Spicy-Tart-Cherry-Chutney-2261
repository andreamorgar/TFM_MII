With a vegetable peeler remove two 2-inch strips orange zest and cut into fine julienne strips, reserving orange for another use. In a heavy saucepan stir together all ingredients and bring to a boil. Simmer mixture, stirring occasionally (stir more frequently toward end of cooking), about 50 minutes, or until thickened and syrupy. Cool chutney. Chutney keeps, covered and chilled, 3 weeks.
