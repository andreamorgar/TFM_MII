Cook pasta in large pot of rapidly boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, heat oil reserved from sun-dried tomatoes in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook 30 seconds. Add sun-dried tomatoes, ready-cut tomatoes and their liquid and olives and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 4 minutes. Mix basil and both cheeses and stir until cheeses melt. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove sauce from heat. Drain pasta. Add to skillet; toss to coat with sauce. Transfer to bowl; serve.
