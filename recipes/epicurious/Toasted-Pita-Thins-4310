Halve the pita loaves horizontally, forming 32 rounds, and brush the rough side of each round lightly with some of the oil. Cut each round into long thin triangular strips with scissors, bake the strips in one layer in jelly-roll pans in the lower third of a preheated 400°F. oven for 6 to 10 minutes, or until they are golden, and let them cool. The pita thins may be made 1 week in advance and kept in an airtight container.
