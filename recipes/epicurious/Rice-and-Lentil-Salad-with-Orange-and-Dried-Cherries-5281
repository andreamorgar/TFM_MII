Boil water, rice, and salt in a 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan, uncovered and undisturbed, until steam holes appear and surface looks dry, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to very low and cook, covered and undisturbed, 15 minutes more. While rice cooks, simmer lentils in water to cover by 2 inches 18 to 20 minutes, or until just tender, then drain. Stir together shallot, vinegar, and lemon juice and let stand. Finely grate zest from orange and cut away remaining peel and pith. Cut sections free from membranes and cut sections into 1/2-inch pieces. Toss warm rice with lentils, shallot mixture, orange, zest, cherries, oil, and parsley and season with salt and pepper. Serve warm or at room temperature.
