Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, green pepper, garlic and bay leaves. Sauté until vegetables are almost tender, about 10 minutes. Add chili powder, oregano and cumin and sauté 5 minutes. Mix in water, tomato sauce, sugar and coffee powder. Add beans. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low: simmer until mixture thickens, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Before serving, rewarm over low heat, stirring frequently.)
