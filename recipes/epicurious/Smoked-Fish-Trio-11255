In a small bowl whisk together sour cream and peppercorns. Sauce may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. In a blender purée chives with oil and salt until smooth. Pour purée through a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing on solids, and discard solids. Chive oil may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring chive oil to room temperature before proceeding. Whisk lemon juice into chive oil and season with pepper. In a bowl toss mesclun with just enough vinaigrette to coat and season with salt and pepper. On each of 6 chilled plates decoratively layer mesclun and mackerel in small mounds and drizzle with some remaining vinaigrette. On each plate decoratively arrange salmon with a dollop of sauce and 1 lemon wedge, and a wedge of mousse and some toasts.
