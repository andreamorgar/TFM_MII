Return cream mixture to same saucepan and bring to simmer. Whisk egg yolks and sugar in medium bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in hot cream mixture. Return custard to same pan. Stir over medium heat until custard thickens enough to leave path on back of spoon when finger is drawn across, about 5 minutes (do not boil). Cool custard 30 minutes. Puree mangoes in processor until smooth. Strain into small bowl. Measure 1 cup puree and whisk into custard (reserve any remaining mango puree for another use).

(Can be made 2 days ahead. Keep frozen.) Scoop ice cream and sorbet into dessert bowls. Serve with shortbread cookies.
