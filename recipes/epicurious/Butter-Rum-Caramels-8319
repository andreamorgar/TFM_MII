Butter an 8-inch square metal baking pan (do not use glass) and set on a rack. In a 5-quart heavy kettle cook cream, sugars, corn syrup, butter, and salt over moderate heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon and washing down any sugar crystals clinging to side of pan with a brush dipped in cold water, until sugars are completely dissolved, about 15 minutes. Boil mixture, without stirring, until a candy or digital thermometer registers 245°F., about 15 minutes. Remove pan from heat and add extract, swirling pan until combined. Immediately pour caramel into baking pan set on rack and cool completely. Chill caramel until firm, at least 12 hours, and up to 1 week. Line a cutting board with wax paper and invert caramel onto it. Bring caramel to room temperature, about 30 minutes. With an oiled sharp knife cut caramel into pieces, each about 3/4 inch long and 1/3 inch wide. Individually wrap caramel pieces in wax paper or candy wrappers or layer between sheets of wax paper (do not use foil or parchment) in an airtight container. Caramels keep at cool room temperature 2 weeks.
