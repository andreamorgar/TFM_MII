Mix preserves and 1 tablespoon kirsch in small bowl; set mixture aside. Combine cream, sugar, vanilla and remaining 1 tablespoon kirsch in medium bowl. Beat to soft peaks. Cover and refrigerate whipped cream. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead.) Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter six 1 1/4-cup soufflé dishes. Sprinkle with almonds or sugar. Place flour in heavy large saucepan. Gradually whisk in milk. Mix in 1/3 cup sugar, then cherries. Bring to boil, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Mix in yolks 1 at a time. Add butter and stir until melted. Mix in kirsch, vanilla and cinnamon. (Soufflé base can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Press plastic onto surface and let stand at room temperature. Before continuing, reheat over low heat until barely warm, stirring constantly.) Beat whites and salt in large bowl until soft peaks form. Add remaining tablespoons sugar and beat until stiff but not dry. Mix 1/4 of whites into soufflé base. Gently fold in remaining whites. Divide among prepared dishes. Place in oven and reduce temperature to 375°F. Bake soufflés until firm to touch and tops are brown, about 18 minutes. Serve immediately, topping each with dollop of whipped cream and spoonful of cherry preserves mixture.
