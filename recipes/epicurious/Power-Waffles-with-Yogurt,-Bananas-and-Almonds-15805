Mix first 4 ingredients in medium bowl to blend. Let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Mix both flours, oats, cinnamon and salt in large bowl. Add yeast mixture; stir to blend (batter will be thick). Cover and chill at least 1 hour or overnight. Preheat oven to 200°F. Preheat Belgian waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Mix egg whites, melted butter and baking powder into batter. Spoon 1 cup batter onto iron; spread with spatula. Cover and cook until golden and cooked through, about 4 minutes. Transfer waffle to baking sheet and keep warm in oven. Repeat, making 6 waffles total. Place waffles on plates. Top with yogurt, bananas, honey and almonds.
