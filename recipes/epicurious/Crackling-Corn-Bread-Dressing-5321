Preheat oven to 425°F. Sauté bacon in heavy large skillet over medium heat until crisp. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels; drain. Reserve 1/4 cup drippings; brush 13x9x2-inch baking dish with some remaining bacon drippings (or melted butter, if needed). Crumble corn bread into large bowl. Mix in celery, onion, pecans, sage, and reserved 1/4 cup bacon drippings and bacon. Season with pepper. Beat eggs and broth in medium bowl to blend; stir into dressing mixture. Transfer dressing to prepared dish. Bake dressing until cooked through and golden, about 35 minutes.
