Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F. Stir together olive paste, oil, and a pinch of pepper in a bowl, then add bread, gently tossing to coat. Spread bread in 1 layer in a shallow baking pan and toast, stirring once, until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool in pan on a rack, then transfer to a small bowl. Increase oven temperature to 425°F. Wrap beets tightly in double layers of foil in 4 bundles (about 10 beets each) and roast until tender, about 1 hour. Carefully unwrap beets and, when cool enough to handle, slip off and discard skins. Trim beets and halve lengthwise. Whisk together shallot, mustard, vinegar, lemon juice, soy sauce, and salt in a small bowl, then add oil in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified. Season with pepper. Toss beets with 1/4 cup vinaigrette in a bowl, then season with salt and pepper. Divide beets among 8 plates and top with frisée. Drizzle frisée with remaining vinaigrette and sprinkle croutons on top. Shave thin slices of ricotta salata over each salad using a cheese plane or a vegetable peeler.
