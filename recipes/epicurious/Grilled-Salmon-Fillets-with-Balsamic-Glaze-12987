Combine first 4 ingredients in medium saucepan. Boil until reduced to 1/3 cup, about 17 minutes. Season glaze to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over low heat before using.) Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Brush salmon lightly with oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill salmon, flesh side down first, until just opaque in center, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer salmon to platter. Drizzle glaze over salmon.
