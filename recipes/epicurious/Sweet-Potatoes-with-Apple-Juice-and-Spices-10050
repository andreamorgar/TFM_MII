Preheat oven to 400°F. Place large baking sheet in oven to heat. Combine sweet potatoes, apple juice concentrate, cinnamon and cloves in medium bowl. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Cut 2 sheets of foil, each about 20 inches long. Place 1 foil sheet on work surface. Spread half of sweet potatoes on 1 half of foil so that potato slices are not more than 2 deep. Drizzle with 1/2 tablespoon butter. Fold foil over, enclosing contents completely and crimping edges tightly to seal. Repeat with second foil sheet and remaining ingredients. Place foil packets on heated baking sheet. Bake until sweet potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven; let stand 5 minutes. Divide among 4 plates and serve.
