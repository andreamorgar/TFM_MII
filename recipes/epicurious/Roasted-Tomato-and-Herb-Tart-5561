Preheat oven to 375°F. Place garlic on 6-inch square of foil; drizzle garlic with 1 teaspoon oil. Seal foil packet. Toss tomatoes, salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons oil in bowl. Arrange tomatoes, cut side up, on rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle any juices in bowl over tomatoes. Place garlic packet on same sheet. Bake until garlic is soft, about 50 minutes.

Place garlic cloves between tomatoes. Sprinkle with thyme, rosemary, and 1/2 cup cheese. Bake tart until golden, about 25 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
