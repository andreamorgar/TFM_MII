Put the cornmeal in the top of a double boiler and stir in 1 cup water. When well mixed, stir in 3 1/2 cups boiling water. Cook over a very low flame, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes to a boil. Add salt. Place over hot water and continue cooking for 35 minutes to 1 hour. Add butter and a lavish sprinkling of grated Parmesan cheese, or grate the cheese over the polenta just before serving. Serve the polenta with game, pork or with spicy Mexican food.
