Add cheese and stir until melted and well blended. Keep warm. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Refrigerate. Rewarm over low heat before using.) Preheat oven to 300°F. Place bacon in single layer in baking pan. Bake until brown, about 10 minutes. Place 2 inches salted water in large skillet. Add vinegar and bring to simmer. Break eggs 1 at a time into cup and slide into water. Poach until whites are set but yolks are still runny, about 4 minutes. Place 2 muffin halves on each of 4 plates. Top muffin half with 1 slice Canadian bacon and 1 egg. Spoon some sauce over. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.
