Combine all ingredients except chicken in heavy medium saucepan. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover; simmer until chilies and cherries are tender, about 20 minutes. Working in batches, purée mixture in blender. Return sauce to pan. If necessary, simmer uncovered until sauce is reduced to 3 cups and thickens. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill.) Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Grill until just cooked through, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes. Brush sauce over; continue grilling until glazed, turning chicken and basting often with more sauce, about 5 minutes longer. Serve with remaining sauce.
