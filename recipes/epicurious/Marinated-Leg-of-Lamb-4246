Have the leg boned, leaving just the shank bone, and tied firmly. Pique surface of meat with garlic (cut gashes and insert garlic slivers). Rub leg well with rosemary and tarragon and put it in a deep kettle with the onion, bay leaf, parsley, garlic, salt, 1 teaspoon rosemary, pepper, and enough red wine to cover half the meat. Marinate in refigerator for 30 to 48 hours, turning leg several times to bathe it evenly. To cook, put leg in roasting pan and roast at 375° F, basting occasionally with some of the marinade. Allow 15 minutes per pound for rare lamb or about 18 minutes per pound for medium rare. If you use a meat thermometer, the lamb will be cooked rare when the thermometer registers 140°F. Serve with boiled white beans mixed with chopped garlic, chopped parsley, and olive oil. With this, drink a California Pinot Noir.
