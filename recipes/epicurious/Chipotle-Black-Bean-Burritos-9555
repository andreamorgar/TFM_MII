Heat olive oil in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and chili powder; sauté until onion softens, about 4 minutes. Stir in beans, corn, and 1/3 cup salsa. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook 10 minutes to blend flavors, stirring often. Season filling to taste with salt and pepper. Stir together remaining 3/4 cup salsa, diced avocado, and 2 tablespoons cilantro in small bowl. Heat tortillas 1 at a time over gas flame or electric burner for several seconds on each side to soften. Transfer to work surface. Spoon filling onto centers of tortillas, dividing equally. Top each with 1 tablespoon cheese and 1 tablespoon cilantro. Fold 2 sides in over filling, then roll up burrito from unfolded edge. Place 1 burrito, seam side down, on each of 4 plates. Top with avocado-salsa mixture and remaining cheese.
