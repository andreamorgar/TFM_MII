Sprinkle pork on both sides with 3/4 teaspoon rosemary, salt and pepper. Coat with flour; shake off excess. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic; sauté until beginning to color, about 2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, discard garlic. Add pork to skillet and sauté until brown and cooked through, about 7 minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer pork to plate. Tent with foil to keep warm. Add chicken broth, white wine, cream, vinegar and remaining 1/4 teaspoon rosemary to skillet. Boil until sauce thickens enough to coat back of spoon, stirring often, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour any collected pork juices from plate into skillet. Spoon sauce over pork and serve.
