Preheat oven to 425°F. Rub lamb well with salt and pepper to taste and cover ends of bones with foil. Put lamb in an oiled roasting pan and roast in middle of oven 25 to 30 minutes, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat inside the crown registers 130°F. to 135°F. for medium-rare meat. Transfer lamb to a platter and let stand, covered loosely, 15 minutes. While lamb is standing, spoon off excess fat from pan juices. Set pan over moderately high heat and add vinegar and wine. Deglaze pan, scraping up brown bits and boiling liquid until reduced to about 1/4 cup. Add broth and bring to a boil. In a small bowl whisk arrowroot and water until smooth and add to boiling broth mixture, whisking. Simmer sauce, whisking, 2 minutes, or until slightly thickened, and season with salt and pepper. Keep sauce warm, covered. Remove foil from bones and spoon some rice into crown, serving remaining rice on side. Arrange glazed vegetables around roast and strain sauce through a fine sieve into a sauceboat. Garnish platter with mint sprigs and serve with jelly.
