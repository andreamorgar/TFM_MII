Preheat oven to 250 degrees. Lightly grease a cookie sheet. Sift powdered sugar, cocoa, coffee and salt. Put dry mix and almonds in blender—grind until it becomes a fine powder. Beat the egg whites and vanilla extract until stiff. Fold the powdered mix with the stiff egg whites. Drop meringue mix with a tablespoon onto cookie sheet. Bake for 2 to 3 hours, turn off the oven, leave meringues in oven for 20 minutes, then serve. Adapted from The Moosewood Cookbook by Mollie Katzen.
