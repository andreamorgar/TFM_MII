Heat oven to 350°F. Place tomatoes on a cookie sheet and brush lightly with oil. Roast 20 minutes, then puree in a blender and strain. Cool puree. Combine next 6 ingredients in a chilled bowl and toss. Add vinegar to tomato puree and whisk in remaining oil, shallot and parsley. Drip 1/2 cup vinaigrette on the inside rim of bowl, then toss salad again. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
