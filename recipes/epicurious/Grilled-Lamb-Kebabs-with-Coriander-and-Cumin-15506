Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Whisk first 7 ingredients in medium bowl to blend. Add lamb; toss to coat evenly. Let stand 5 minutes. Thread lamb on skewers, leaving 1/2-inch space between each piece. Grill or broil lamb until crusty brown outside but still pink inside, turning occasionally, about 8 minutes. Arrange skewers on plates and serve.
