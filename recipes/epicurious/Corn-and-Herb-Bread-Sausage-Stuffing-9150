Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 13x9x2 glass baking dish. Sauté first 3 ingredients in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until sausage is brown and vegetables are tender, breaking up sausage with fork, about 15 minutes. Drain off fat. Transfer sausage mixture to large bowl. Add both stuffing mixes, poultry seasoning, sage and pepper and toss until well blended. Gradually mix in broth. Transfer stuffing to prepared dish. Cover with foil and bake until heated through, about 40 minutes. Uncover and bake until slightly crusty on top, about 5 minutes longer.
