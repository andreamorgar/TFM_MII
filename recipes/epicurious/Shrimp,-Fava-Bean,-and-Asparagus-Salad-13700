In a small bowl whisk together honey, mustard, lime juice, and tarragon. Add oil in a stream, whisking until emulsified, and season with salt and pepper. Dressing may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring dressing to room temperature before proceeding. Stir in chives. Have ready a large bowl of ice and cold water. In a large saucepan of boiling salted water cook favas until crisp-tender, about 2 1/2 minutes, and transfer with a slotted spoon to ice water to stop cooking. Drain favas in a colander and gently peel away outer skins. Transfer favas to a large serving bowl. Have ready another large bowl of ice and cold water. Return water in pan to a boil and cook asparagus until crisp-tender, about 3 1/2 minutes. Transfer asparagus with slotted spoon to ice water to stop cooking. Drain asparagus in colander and pat dry with paper towels. Return water in pan to a boil and cook shrimp until just cooked through, about 2 minutes. Transfer shrimp with slotted spoon to paper towels to cool. In bowl with favas, toss together 1/3 cup dressing, asparagus, shrimp, mâche, frisée, and salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle salad with some of remaining dressing and garnish with chives.
