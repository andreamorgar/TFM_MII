Boil potato in medium pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 10 minutes; drain. Blend 1/2 cup black-eyed peas, 1/2 cup water, ginger and turmeric in processor until smooth. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add curry powder and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add remaining 1 1/2 cups black-eyed peas, puree from processor, potato and tomato to skillet. Cook until mixture is thick and creamy, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm before continuing.) Transfer curry to large bowl. Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve.
