Boil chickpeas in water to cover by 2 inches in a 3-quart saucepan, covered, 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let chickpeas stand, covered, 1 hour. Drain chickpeas and return to pan. Add water to cover by 4 inches, onion, and thyme and simmer, uncovered, until chickpeas are tender, about 1 1/4 hours, adding salt during last 10 minutes of cooking. Drain chickpeas and transfer to a bowl of cold water. Slip skins from chickpeas by rubbing them with your fingers, then drain well.
