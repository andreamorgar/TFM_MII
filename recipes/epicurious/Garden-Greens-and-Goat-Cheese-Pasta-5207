Pull the tough stems away from the leaves of:
1 bunch of kale (lacinato, Red Russian, or Siberian) Put the stems into the compost bucket and wash the leaves in cool water. Drain. Cook the leaves until tender in boiling salted water. Remove from the water and let cool. Bring the water back to a boil and add:
1 pound whole-wheat spaghetti While the pasta is cooking, heat a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat and pour in:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Stir in the greens and heat through. Move the greens from the center of the pan and add:
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped Allow to cook for a minute and stir into the greens. Taste for salt and add as needed. When the pasta is cooked, drain it in a colander, reserving some of the cooking liquid. Add the drained pasta to the greens with:
1/3 cup crumbled fresh goat cheese
A pinch of dried chile flakes
A drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil Stir the greens, pasta, and goat cheese together. The cheese will melt, making a creamy sauce. Add cooking water as needed to loosen. Taste for salt one last time before serving.
