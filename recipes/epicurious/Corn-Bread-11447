Heat dry skillets in upper and lower thirds of oven while preheating oven to 450°F. Whisk together cornmeal, flour, baking powder and soda, and salt. Add eggs, buttermilk, and 1 cup melted butter, then quickly stir together. Remove hot skillets from oven. Divide remaining 1/2 cup melted butter between them, then divide batter between pans. Bake in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of pans halfway through baking, until golden and a tester inserted in center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes total.
