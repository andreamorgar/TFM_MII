Preheat oven to 425°F. Spray large rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray. Combine fennel, olive oil, garlic, thyme, and crushed red pepper in large bowl; toss to coat. Spread fennel out on baking sheet; sprinkle with coarse kosher salt and pepper. Roast fennel 15 minutes. Using tongs, turn wedges over. Continue to roast until tender, turning 1 more time, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle olives over fennel. Roast until fennel begins to brown at edges, about 8 minutes longer. Season fennel with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl and serve. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Serve warm or at room temperature.
