Cut 12 6-inch squares of aluminum foil and line 12 4-inch tart molds. Melt the chocolate in the top half of a double boiler or in a small bowl set over a saucepan of water. Place over low heat and stir often. When all the chocolate has melted, remove it from the heat and pour equal amounts into the lined molds. Let the chocolate cool for 5 to 10 minutes in the molds and then distribute the various nuts and raisins equally over the tops. If they sink, wait another few minutes and try again. The chocolate should be soft enough that the nuts and raisins adhere, but not so soft that they sink. When the chocolates have hardened, lift them out of the molds and gently remove the aluminum foil. The cooling process can be speeded up by putting the candies in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Place the chocolates on a serving tray or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
