Form mixture by 1/4 cupfuls into eight 1/2-inch-thick fish cakes. Place remaining 1/2 cup breadcrumbs in shallow dish. Roll fish cakes in breadcrumbs, coating completely. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches and adding more oil as necessary, cook fish cakes until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.
