Drain pasta and asparagus in colander. Meanwhile, heat large skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham and cook until just brown, stirring frequently, about 2 minutes. Add wine; boil until reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Add cream; bring to simmer. Stir in cheese and 3/4 cup green onions. Add pasta and asparagus and toss with sauce to coat.
