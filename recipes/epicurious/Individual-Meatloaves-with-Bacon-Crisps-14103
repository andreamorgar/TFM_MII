Put oven rack in middle positionand preheat oven to 400°F. Line a shallow baking pan with foil. Cook onion and garlic in oil in a 10-inch skillet over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until just softened, about 4 minutes. Stir together bread crumbs,milk, eggs, parsley, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Gently combine meat if necessary, then add to bread-crumb mixture along with onion mixture and gently knead with your hands until just combined. (Mixture will be moist. Wipe out skillet and reserve.) Using a 1-cup measure, drop slightly rounded cups of mixture into baking pan and lightly pat to form 4 domes. Stir together ketchup and vinegar and spoon over mounds. Bake meatloaves until center of each loaf registers 155°F on thermometer, about 25 minutes. While meatloaves bake, cook bacon in skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp, about 7 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Turn on broiler and broil meatloaves 2 to 3 inches from heat until glaze is slightly caramelized, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve meatloaves topped with bacon.
