1. Place oil in a large, heavy pot over medium heat. Brown the sirloin in batches. Remove to a bowl with a slotted spoon. Add ground beef, chorizo, and onions to the pot to brown, breaking up the meat. Return sirloin to the pot. 2. Stir in remaining ingredients, except for garnishes. Bring to a boil, reduce heat; simmer for 2 hours. Stir occasionally, breaking up tomatoes. 3. Before serving, discard cinnamon stick, bay leaves, and jalapeños. Serve garnished with grated cheese and a dollop of sour cream, if desired.
