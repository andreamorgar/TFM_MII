Stir together bread crumbs, salt, and 1 tablespoon oil in a small bowl until combined well. Transfer to a 12-inch heavy skillet and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until crisp and golden, 3 to 5 minutes, then return to bowl. Heat remaining 1/4 cup oil in skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté cauliflower, stirring occasionally, until browned well, about 8 minutes. Add pancetta and sauté, stirring frequently, until just beginning to crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in garlic and red pepper flakes and sauté, stirring, 1 minute. Add broth, then reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until cauliflower is tender and sauce is slightly reduced, about 7 minutes. While sauce simmers, cook linguine in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water , uncovered, until al dente, then drain in a colander. Stir cheese into sauce and simmer 1 minute. Toss pasta with cauliflower mixture and parsley in a large bowl, then sprinkle with bread crumbs. Serve with additional cheese.
