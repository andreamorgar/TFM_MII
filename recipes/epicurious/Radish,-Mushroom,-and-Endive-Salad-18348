In a large bowl whisk together the mustard, the vinegar, and salt to taste, add the oil, a little at a time, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. Add the lettuce, the radishes, the mushrooms, the endive, the parsley, and pepper to taste and toss the salad to coat it with the dressing.
