Cut the apricots in two, spear them on the stalks of rosemary, making them overlap. For the syrup, combine the honey with the orange juice, reduce in a saucepan, add the butter and the peach liqueur, reduce again: the texture should be syrupy. Cook the apricot skewers over high heat for 5 minutes. Serve immediately, coated with syrup.
