Place avocado, basil, 1/2 cup broth, garlic and lime juice in blender. Blend until chopped, scraping down sides as needed. With machine running, gradually add oil and blend until smooth. If too thick, gradually add more broth by tablespoons. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead; chill.)
