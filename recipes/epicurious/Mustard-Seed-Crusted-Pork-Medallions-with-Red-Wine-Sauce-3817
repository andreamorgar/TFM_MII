Preheat oven to 400°F. Cut pork tenderloins crosswise into 1 1/2-inch-wide medallions, then lightly pound with meat mallet to 3/4-inch thickness; sprinkle with pepper. Combine breadcrumbs, coarsely ground mustard seeds, whole mustard seeds, and salt in pie dish or wide bowl. In medium bowl, whisk together egg whites and water. Dip pork in egg white mixture; coat with mustard-seed mixture on both sides; and place on rimmed baking sheet. In heavy large skillet over medium-high heat, heat olive oil. Working in batches, cook pork until brown, about 1 1/2 minutes per side, adding more oil to pan if necessary. Transfer to baking sheet; roast until instant-read thermometer inserted into meat registers 140°F, about 10 minutes (meat will continue to cook as it rests). Transfer pork to large platter; let rest 10 minutes. Serve with red wine sauce .
