Sprinkle chicken on both sides with 3/4 teaspoon paprika, then salt and pepper. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and sauté until cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to plate. Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter and onion to skillet. Reduce heat to medium. Cover and cook 5 minutes. Mix in 3/4 teaspoon paprika, then wine and cream. Boil until sauce thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. Return chicken and any juices to skillet; simmer to rewarm, about 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper and serve.
