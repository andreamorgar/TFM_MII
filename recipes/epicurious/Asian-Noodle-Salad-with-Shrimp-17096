Cook noodles in large saucepan of boiling salted water until tender, stirring occasionally, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain. Rinse with cold water; drain well. Using scissors, cut noodles into thirds. Whisk lime juice, fish sauce, chili-garlic sauce, and sugar in small bowl until sugar dissolves. Place shrimp in medium bowl. Add 2 tablespoons dressing; toss to coat. Divide noodles among bowls. Top with cucumber slices and all remaining ingredients. Spoon shrimp with dressing over, and drizzle with remaining dressing.
