Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Cook pasta in a 7- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water 6 minutes, then stir in broccoli rabe and boil until pasta is al dente, about 5 minutes more. While pasta is cooking, toss panko with 1 tablespoon oil in a shallow baking pan until coated and bake, stirring once or twice, until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Season crumbs with salt. While broccoli rabe (with pasta) is cooking, cook garlic, anchovies, and red-pepper flakes in remaining 7 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring and mashing anchovies into oil with a wooden spoon, until garlic is golden, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Drain pasta and broccoli rabe in a colander, then add to anchovy mixture in skillet, tossing to combine. Serve pasta sprinkled with some toasted panko and pass remainder.
