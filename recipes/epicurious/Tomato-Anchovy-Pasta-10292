Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add green onions and garlic and sauté until soft, about 5 minutes. Add anchovies and stir 1 minute. Add tomatoes and simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 6 minutes. (Can be made prepared 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.) Cook rotini in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking liquid. Add reserved cooking liquid to tomato-anchovy sauce in skillet and stir over medium-high heat until heated through. Add rotini and toss until sauce coats rotini. Add Parmesan cheese and toss to blend. Season pasta to taste with salt and pepper.
