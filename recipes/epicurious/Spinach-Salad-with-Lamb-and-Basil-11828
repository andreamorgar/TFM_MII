Trim and tie lamb. Season lamb with salt and pepper and in a sealable plastic bag combine lamb, 2 tablespoons oil, and 1 tablespoon basil, turning lamb to coat evenly. Marinate lamb, covered and chilled, 4 hours. Cut roasted peppers into thin 2-inch long strips and in a bowl combine with vinegar and 2 tablespoons oil. Chill peppers, covered, until assembling salad. In another bowl coarsely crumble goat cheese and gently stir together with 2 tablespoons oil and 1 tablespoon basil. Chill goat cheese, covered, until assembling salad. In a blender blend remaining 1/4 cup oil, remaining tablespoon basil, and salt and pepper to taste until smooth. Transfer basil oil to a small bowl. Chill basil oil, covered, while preparing lamb. Bring basil oil to room temperature before assembling salad. Preheat oven to 450°F. Heat an ovenproof heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) over moderately high heat until hot and brown lamb on all sides. Put skillet in middle of oven and roast lamb about 10 minutes, or until a meat thermometer registers 140°F. for medium-rare. Cool lamb. Chill lamb, covered, at least 2 hours and up to 1 day. Cut lamb into thin slices. Discard coarse stems from spinach and arrange leaves around edges of 4 large plates. Scatter come peppers evenly over spinach and mound some goat cheese in center of each plate. Arrange lamb slices around goat cheese and drizzle salads with basil oil.
