Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Whisk first 5 ingredients in 8x8x2-inch glass baking dish to blend. Add beef and green onions; stir to coat. Let stand 10 minutes. Thread beef onto 2 long metal skewers. Thread green onions and bell pepper squares onto 2 long metal skewers. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill beef and vegetables until beef is cooked to desired doneness and vegetables are slightly charred and almost tender, turning often, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, grill tortillas until warm and beginning to brown in spots, about 1 minute per side. Using fork, push beef and vegetables off skewers onto work surface; chop coarsely. Place 2 tortillas on each plate. Divide filling among tortillas; roll up and serve.
