Preheat oven to 325°F. Soak matzos in cold water until slightly softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on a rack. Stir together cottage cheese, eggs, 6 tablespoons sugar, cinnamon, pecans, and raisins. Coat bottom and sides of an 8-inch square baking dish or pan with half of butter. Put 1 matzo in dish and spread half of cottage-cheese mixture over it. Top with another matzo and remaining cottage cheese mixture. Top with remaining matzo, brush with remaining butter, and sprinkle with remaining tablespoon sugar. Bake pudding in middle of oven until golden, puffed, and set, about 1 hour. Cut into squares and serve warm.
