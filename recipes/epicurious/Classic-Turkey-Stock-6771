Pat neck and giblets dry, then cut neck into pieces with a large knife. Heat oil in a 4-to 5-quart heavy pot over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then cook neck, giblets, and onion, turning occasionally, until well browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add remaining ingredients, then simmer, partially covered, skimming any froth, 2 hours. Strain stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pressing on and then discarding solids. If more than 5 cups, boil to reduce.
