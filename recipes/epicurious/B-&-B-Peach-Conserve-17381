Scald the peaches, discard pits and dice coarsely. Sliver the apricots. Combine peaches, apricots, brown sugar, granulated sugar and cinnamon in a large pot. Cook over high heat for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until a thermometer registers 220° or until the juice has thickened. (It will thicken more as it cools.) Remove from heat, stir in angelica, nuts and B & B. Pour into hot, sterilized jars and seal.
