Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then cook tomatoes and garlic, lightly pressing tomatoes occasionally, until tomatoes begin to burst, about 5 minutes. While tomatoes cook, heat remaining tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then brown pork chops on both sides, about 4 minutes total. Stir beans into tomatoes along with olive paste, thyme, and salt and pepper to taste and cook, covered, 2 minutes. Add chops and cook, covered, until heated through, about 2 minutes.
