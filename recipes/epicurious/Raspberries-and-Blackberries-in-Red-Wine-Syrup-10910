Cook sugar in a 3-quart dry heavy saucepan over moderately low heat, stirring slowly with a fork (to help sugar melt evenly), until melted and pale golden. Cook caramel without stirring, swirling pan, until deep golden. Remove pan from heat and carefully add wine (mixture will bubble up and caramel will harden), then simmer until caramel is dissolved and syrup is reduced to about 1 1/2 cups, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Divide berries among 8 serving bowls, then spoon syrup over berries.
