In a bowl wash the rice well in several changes of cold water and drain it in a sieve. In a small saucepan combine the rice, the salt, and 3/4 cup water and simmer the mixture, covered, for 18 minutes, or until the water is absorbed. Transfer the rice to a large bowl and let it cool for 10 minutes. In a wok or heavy skillet heat the oil over high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it stir-fry the ginger for 10 seconds, or until it is fragrant. Add the rice, the peas, the corn, the carrot, and the scallions and stir-fry the mixture for 1 minute. Add the Worcestershire sauce and the vinegar and stir-fry the mixture for 1 minute, or until it is hot. Stir in the basil and salt and pepper to taste.
