In a skillet cook the sausage in 1/2 cup of the water, covered, over moderate heat for 20 minutes and add the onion, the fennel, and the bell peppers. Increase the heat to moderately high, sauté the mixture, uncovered, stirring frequently and adding more water if necessary to keep the mixture from sticking, for 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender, and sprinkle it with the scallions.
