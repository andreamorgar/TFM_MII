Whisk yellow cornmeal, flour, baking soda, salt and black pepper in large bowl to blend. Stir in grated Parmesan cheese. Whisk buttermilk and eggs in medium bowl until well blended. Stir in thawed yellow corn and chopped green onions. Add buttermilk mixture to cornmeal mixture and whisk just until blended. Spray large nonstick skillet with vegetable oil spray; heat over medium heat. Working in batches and removing skillet from heat and spraying with vegetable oil spray before each batch, drop batter into skillet by scant 1/4 cupfuls. Cook until corn cakes are golden brown, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Serve corn cakes warm.
