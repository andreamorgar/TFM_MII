In a small bowl sprinkle the gelatin over the water and let it stand. In a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water whisk together the vinegar, the sugar, the mustard, the mustard seeds, and the eggs, cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until it registers 160°F. on a candy thermometer, and remove the bowl from the heat. Stir in the gelatin mixture, the paprika, and salt and pepper to taste, stirring until the gelatin is dissolved, transfer the bowl to a larger bowl of ice and cold water, and stir the mixture until it is cold. In a bowl beat the cream until it holds stiff peaks, fold it into the egg mixture with the parsley until the mixture is combined well, and pour the mixture into a lightly oiled 5- to 6-cup ring mold. Chill the aspic, covered, for 4 hours, or until it is set. Dip the ring mold in hot water, run a knife around the edges of the aspic, and invert the aspic onto a serving plate. Serve the aspic with cold poached salmon, shrimp, crab, or chicken.
