Cook the turkey in water with onion, celery, parsley and peppers, as for Turkey Chili. Remove and cool. Cut the meat from the bird into small dice. Reduce the broth to 4 cups. Sauté the onion in the butter and oil, add the tomatoes and simmer until the tomatoes are melted into the onions. Add the basil, salt and freshly ground pepper. Combine with the 4 cups broth and cook down for 20 minutes. Add the diced turkey and heat through. Put the pasta on a large platter (toss it with a little oil first). Spoon some of the turkey sauce over the top and serve the remainder in a bowl. Serve grated cheese in bowls, to sprinkle on top. Drink a Volpolicella or Chianti.
