Line heavy large skillet with foil. Place tomatoes and chiles in skillet; cook over medium-high heat until skins begin to blister and blacken in spots, turning occasionally, about 20 minutes for tomatoes and 10 minutes for chiles. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Peel tomatoes; transfer to processor. Add chiles, onion, and garlic. Blend until coarse puree forms. Transfer sauce to bowl. Stir in cilantro, parsley, and salt. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover and chill.) Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Rinse fish inside and out with cold water; pat dry. Open fish flat, like a book. Rub fish inside and out with oil; sprinkle inside with oregano, salt, and pepper. If grilling, place fish, opened flat, in grill basket. If broiling, place fish, opened flat, on oiled rimmed baking sheet. Grill or broil fish just until opaque in center, about 6 minutes per side. Using spatula, transfer fish to platter. Sprinkle with lime juice; serve with tomato sauce and warm corn tortillas.
