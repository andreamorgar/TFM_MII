Cook beans in a 4- to 5-quart pot of boiling salted water , uncovered, until just tender, about 5 minutes. Drain beans in a colander. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then fry shallots in 3 batches, stirring frequently, until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per batch (watch carefully; shallots burn easily). Transfer shallots quickly as browned with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. (Shallots will become crisp as they cool.) Discard all but about 1 tablespoon oil from skillet, then cook chile over moderate heat, stirring, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add beans and salt and toss with tongs until heated through. Remove from heat and add fried shallots and mint, tossing to combine.
