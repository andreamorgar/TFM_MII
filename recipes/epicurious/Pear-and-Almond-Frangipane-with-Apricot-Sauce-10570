Combine water, 2 1/2 cups sugar, lemon juice and vanilla in large pot. Stir over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves. Add pears. Bring liquid to boil. Reduce heat to medium; simmer until pears are just tender, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes. Cool pears in poaching liquid. Stir preserves in small saucepan until melted. Add rum. (Pears and sauce can be made 1 day ahead. Cover separately; chill.) Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 10- to 11-inch-diameter quiche dish with about 1 1/2-inch-high sides. Grind nuts in processor. Add 1 3/4 cups sugar, eggs and almond extract. Process until well blended. Pour into dish. Drain pears; arrange atop batter, cut side down and stem end toward center. Bake until tester inserted into cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool on rack. Rewarm apricot sauce over medium-low heat. Serve cake with sauce.
