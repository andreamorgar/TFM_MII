Sauté sausages in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until light brown, breaking up clumps with back of spoon, about 5 minutes. Add bell peppers, onion and garlic and sauté until tender and golden brown, about 12 minutes. Add wine; simmer until liquid is slightly reduced, about 6 minutes. Meanwhile, cook linguine in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain pasta. Add pasta to skillet; toss to combine. Add 1/4 cup Parmesan; toss to blend. Season with salt and pepper. Serve pasta, passing additional cheese separately.
