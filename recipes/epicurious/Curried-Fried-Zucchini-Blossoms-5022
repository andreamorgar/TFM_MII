In a bowl whisk together the flour, the curry powder, and the salt, add 1 cup of the seltzer, and whisk the batter until it is smooth. Let the batter stand for 10 minutes and, if desired, thin it with enough of the remaining seltzer to reach the consistency of crêpe batter. In a small bowl toss together the mozzarella and the coriander and divide the mixture among the blossoms, stuffing it inside them and pressing the ends of the blossoms closed. In a deep skillet heat 1 inch of the oil to 375°F. on a deep-fat thermometer. Working quickly in batches, dip the blossoms, 1 at a time, in the batter, coating them completely, and fry them in the oil, turning them, for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, or until they are golden and crisp. (Make sure the oil returns to 375°F. before adding each new batch.) Transfer the blossoms as they are fried with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, sprinkle them with salt, and serve them warm.
