Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Cut neck into 1-inch pieces. Brown neck, giblets, celery, carrot, and onion, turning occasionally, about 6 minutes. Add chicken stock, scraping up brown bits. Transfer mixture to a 3-quart saucepan. Add water, bay leaf, peppercorns, and thyme and simmer, uncovered, until liquid is reduced to about 4 cups, 40 to 45 minutes. Strain stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl (discard solids). Skim off and discard any fat.
