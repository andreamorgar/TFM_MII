Combine cheese, butter, parsley and 3/4 teaspoon rosemary in medium bowl. Stir to blend well. Mix in walnuts. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer blue cheese butter to small bowl. (Blue cheese butter can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring butter to room temperature before using.) Combine 1 tablespoon rosemary, garlic, salt and pepper in processor. Blend until mixture resembles coarse paste. Pat steaks dry. Place in large baking dish. Rub 2 teaspoons of garlic paste on each side of each steak. Cover and let stand 1 hour at room temperature. Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Grill steaks to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to platter and let stand 5 minutes. Cut each steak into 3 equal portions. Top each portion with a spoonful of blue cheese butter and serve.
