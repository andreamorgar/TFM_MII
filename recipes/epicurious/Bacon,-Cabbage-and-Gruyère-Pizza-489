Preheat oven to 400°F. Sauté bacon in heavy large skillet over medium heat until brown and crisp. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels and drain. Pour off drippings from skillet and discard. Add cabbage to same skillet and sauté until wilted, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle caraway seeds and vinegar over and blend well. Season cabbage mixture with salt and pepper. Place pizza crust on heavy large baking sheet. Spread with mustard, then cabbage mixture. Sprinkle with bacon. Top with cheeses, spreading evenly. Bake pizza until cheeses melt and crust is crisp, about 20 minutes.
