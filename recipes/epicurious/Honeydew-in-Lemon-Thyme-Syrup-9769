Bring water, sugar, and lemon thyme to a boil in a 1-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Boil syrup until reduced to about 3/4 cup, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove pan from heat and steep syrup, covered, 30 minutes. Pour through a sieve into a bowl, pressing on and discarding thyme. While syrup steeps, remove rind from honeydew wedges, then halve each wedge crosswise on a slight diagonal. Put melon in a shallow bowl and drizzle with syrup.
