Arrange the pita pieces close together, rough sides up, on 2 large baking sheets. In a small bowl combine well the sage, the thyme, the salt, and the pepper, sprinkle the mixture over the pita pieces, and scatter the Cheddar on top. Bake the crisps in a preheated 375°F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until they are golden.
