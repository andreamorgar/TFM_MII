Bring sugar and water to a boil in a large pot. Turn heat very low and add figs and lemon and orange. Tie the spices in a cheesecloth bag, add to the pot and simmer slowly for about 1 hour or until the figs look glazed and the juice is syrupy and golden. Discard the spice bag and very carefully spoon the figs, lemon and orange slices and syrup into hot, sterilized preserving jars. Cover and seal.
