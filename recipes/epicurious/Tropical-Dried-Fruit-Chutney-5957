Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into heavy medium saucepan. Add bean, Sherry, cinnamon sticks, and star anise. Bring to simmer over medium heat. Add all dried fruits; return to simmer, stirring occasionally. Simmer until Sherry is almost evaporated, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix in enough pineapple juice by tablespoonfuls to moisten chutney. Transfer to bowl, cover, and refrigerate until cold, at least 3 hours. (Chutney can be made 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.) Remove vanilla bean, cinnamon sticks, and star anise from chutney. Mix in mint and cilantro and serve. *Brown star-shaped seedpods; available in the spice section of some supermarkets and at specialty foods stores and Asian markets.
