Crumble corn bread into 1-inch pieces and transfer to a large baking pan. Dry corn bread, uncovered, at room temperature 12 hours. (Alternatively, dry corn bread in a 250°F oven 1 hour.) Butter a 2-quart baking dish. Pat dry corn kernels. In a bowl toss together corn bread, corn kernels, bell pepper, 1 cup Monterey Jack, scallion, and salt and pepper to taste and transfer to baking dish. In bowl whisk together eggs, enchilada sauce, and broth and pour over corn-bread mixture. Sprinkle remaining cup cheese evenly on top. Chill pudding, covered, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day. Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake pudding in middle of oven until bubbling, about 40 minutes.
