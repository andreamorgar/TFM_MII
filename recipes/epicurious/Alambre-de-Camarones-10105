In a blender or mini food processor, process all marinade ingredients until smooth. Toss shrimp with marinade in a bowl to coat well. Set aside at least 10 minutes, or up to 2 hours. Cut onion into 8 wedges, then cut each wedge lengthwise into thirds. Thread 1 chile onto each skewer. (If you prefer metal skewers, be sure to spray them first with a vegetable-oil cooking spray so shrimp and vegetables don't stick.) Add 1 shrimp, a chunk of onion and a cherry tomato to each skewer; repeat twice. Finish each skewer with a second chile. Season skewers with salt. Heat a cast-iron grill pan or an electric or gas grill over high heat. Cook skewers, covered, turning once, until shrimp are cooked through and onions are charred and just tender, about 5 minutes per side. (You can use a charcoal grill, but shrimp will cook faster.)
