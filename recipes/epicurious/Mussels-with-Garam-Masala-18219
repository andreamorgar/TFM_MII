Heat oil in an 8-quart heavy pot over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Cook onion, fennel, garlic, garam masala, red-pepper flakes, and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper, stirring occasionally, until onion and fennel are tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Add tomatoes with juice and coconut milk and bring just to a boil. Add mussels and cook over medium-high heat, covered, stirring occasionally, just until mussels open wide, 8 to 10 minutes. (Discard any that remain unopened after 10 minutes.) Chop about 2 tablespoons reserved fennel fronds and stir into mussels along with basil.
