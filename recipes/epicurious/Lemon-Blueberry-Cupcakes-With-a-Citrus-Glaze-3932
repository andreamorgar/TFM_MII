Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Line a cupcake pan with twelve paper baking cups, or grease the pan with butter if not using baking cups. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt on a sheet of parchment paper or wax paper and set aside. Combine the milk and vanilla extract in a large liquid measuring cup. In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a bowl with a handheld electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar for 3 to 5 minutes, until it is light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing slowly after each addition. Slowly add one third of the dry ingredients followed by one third of the milk mixture. Mix slowly, and then add another third of the dry ingredients, followed by one third of the milk. Mix slowly until incorporated. Stop to scrape down the bowl as needed. Then, finally, add the last third of the dry ingredients, followed by the last third of the milk. Mix slowly until fully incorporated. Add the lemon juice and lemon zest, and mix slowly. Using a spatula, gently fold the blueberries into the batter. Using a standard-size ice-cream scoop, scoop the batter into the cupcake pan until each well is two-thirds full and bake for 16 to 18 minutes (start checking at 15 minutes). Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Whisk together the confectioners’ sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract in a small bowl, and heat in a small saucepan on low heat until fully incorporated. Let cool for 10 minutes. Pour glaze over each cupcake and enjoy!
