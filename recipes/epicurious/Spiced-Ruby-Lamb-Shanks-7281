Pour the fat from the casserole and wipe clean. 3. Heat the remaining oil in the casserole over low heat. Add the lemons, garlic and cinnamon; cook for 2 minutes, stirring; crush the lemons slightly. Add the remaining ingredients; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and cook for 2 minutes. 4. Return the lamb to the casserole, cover and bake for 1 hour. Uncover and bake until tender, about 45 minutes more, basting occasionally. 5. Remove the lamb to a large, shallow platter. Discard the cinnamon,thyme and bay leaves. Defat the sauce, then spoon it over the lamb. Garnish with the bunches of thyme.
