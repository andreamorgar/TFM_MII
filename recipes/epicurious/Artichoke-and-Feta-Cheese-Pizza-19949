Preheat oven to 425°F. Cut artichokes into 1/2-inch pieces. Sprinkle baking sheet with yellow cornmeal. Unroll pizza crust dough onto prepared baking sheet; press out dough to 11-inch square. Brush dough with 1 tablespoon reserved marinade. Top dough with artichokes, plum tomato slices, crumbled herb-seasoned feta cheese and sweet onion slices. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon marinade. Bake pizza until crust is crisp and golden, about 15 minutes. Transfer to platter. Sprinkle with mint. Cut pizza into 4 squares and serve.
