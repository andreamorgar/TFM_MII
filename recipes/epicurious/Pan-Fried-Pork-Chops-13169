Mix flour, cornstarch and garlic salt in medium bowl. Sprinkle pork chops with salt and pepper. Dredge pork chops in flour mixture (do not shake off excess). Pour enough vegetable oil into heavy large skillet to reach depth of 1 inch. Heat oil to 350°F. Fry pork chops in oil until golden brown and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side
