1. Combine all the ingredients except the rice in a bowl. 2. To make the sushi-rice blocks, use an ice-cube tray as a mold (small cups, mini-muffin tins, and tartlet pans will also work). Prepare the mold by sprinkling it lightly with water. 3. Press the rice into the tray squares, then use your finger to push a hole 3/4 of the way into each square. 4. Turn the mold upside down onto waxed paper, and tap until the squares fall out. 5. Fill each hole with about a teaspoon of the salmon mixture and serve.
