In a 2 1/2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan simmer water, celery, onion, and caraway seeds until celery is very tender, about 30 minutes. Cool mixture slightly and in a blender purée in batches until smooth, transferring to a bowl. Stir in buttermilk and salt and pepper to taste. Chill soup, covered, at least until cold, about 6 hours, and up to 1 day. Before serving, season with salt and pepper if necessary.
