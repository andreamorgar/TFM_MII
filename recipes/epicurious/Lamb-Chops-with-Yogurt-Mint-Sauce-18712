Stir together mint, yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Pat half of lamb chops dry and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté chops, turning once, 6 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer chops to a plate and keep warm, covered with foil. Dry, season, and sauté remaining chops in same manner. Serve topped with yogurt-mint sauce.
