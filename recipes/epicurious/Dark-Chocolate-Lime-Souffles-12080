Preheat oven to 400°F. Place six 3/4-cup soufflé dishes on baking sheet. Mash sugar and lime peel in small bowl. Place chopped chocolate in medium bowl set over saucepan of simmering water; stir until melted. Remove from over water; whisk in egg yolks, salt, and 2 tablespoons lime sugar (mixture will become thick). Beat egg whites in large bowl to soft peaks; add 2 tablespoons lime sugar and beat until stiff but not dry. Whisk 1/3 of whites into chocolate mixture to lighten; fold in remaining whites in 2 additions. Fold in chocolate chips. Spoon mixture into dishes, dividing equally. Bake until softly set and puffed, about 14 minutes. Meanwhile, whip cream, fresh lime juice, and 4 tablespoons lime sugar to peaks in medium bowl. Top soufflés with whipped cream mixture. Sprinkle with additional lime sugar.
