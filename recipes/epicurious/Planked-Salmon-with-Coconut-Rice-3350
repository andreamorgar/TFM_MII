1 Soak the plank in water for 4 hours. Put it on a baking sheet. 2 Preheat oven to 500°F. 3 In a bowl, combine the syrup, mustard, soy sauce, and lime juice. Add the fish; let it marinate for 10 minutes. 4 In a saucepan, bring the broth and coco­nut milk to a boil. 5 Stir in the rice. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until the liquid is absorbed, 20 minutes. 6 Lay the fish on the plank, skin side down. Sprinkle it with salt; drizzle it with marinade. 7 Bake until the thickest part is still springy, 12 to 15 minutes.
