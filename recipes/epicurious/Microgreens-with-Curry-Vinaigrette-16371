Stir together curry powder and water in a small bowl to make a paste. Let stand 5 minutes, then stir in oil and let stand, stirring occasionally, 1 hour. Pour curry oil through a paper-towel-lined sieve into a small cup, discarding any solids. Whisk together vinegar, garlic, salt, and pepper, then add curry oil, whisking until combined. Divide greens among plates (with pork and potatoes, if serving) and drizzle with some dressing.
