Preheat broiler. Force raspberries through a fine sieve into a bowl to remove seeds. Sprinkle cut side of figs with sugar and place, sugared sides up, in a flameproof baking dish. Broil about 4 inches from heat until tops are bubbling and lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Spoon 1 1/2 tablespoons raspberry coulis onto each of 4 dessert plates. Spoon a heaping tablespoon of yogurt in center of each, then arrange 4 fig halves on top.
