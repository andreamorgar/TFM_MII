Pulse garlic, mint, oil, and 1 cup parsley in a food processor until very finely chopped; season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Season chicken with salt and pepper and spread herb paste over flesh side. Place, skin side up, on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet; chill at least 3 hours (the dryer the skin, the crisper it'll get). Place a rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 425°F. Pat chicken dry and place, skin side down, in a large ovenproof skillet, preferably cast iron. Set over medium-high heat and cook, undisturbed, until skin is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add shallots to skillet and transfer to oven. Roast, turning shallots once, 20–25 minutes. Turn skin side up and roast until skin is very crisp and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of thigh registers 160°F, 8–10 minutes longer. Serve chicken with shallots, parsley, and any pan juices. DO AHEAD: Chicken can be rubbed with herb paste 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.
