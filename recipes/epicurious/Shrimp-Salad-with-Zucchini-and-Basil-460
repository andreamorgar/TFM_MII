Drain. Rinse under cold water and cool. Drain well. Transfer to large bowl. Add 1/3 cup dressing and toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Toss greens in large bowl with enough dressing to coat. Divide greens among 4 plates. Arrange shrimp and zucchini atop greens. Serve, passing Parmesan cheese separately, if desired.
