Prepare grill. Divide asparagus into 4 bunches. Align each bunch in a flat row and thread 2 skewers crosswise through each bunch (see photo, above). Brush asparagus with oil and season with kosher salt. Grill asparagus on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals until tender, 3 to 5 minutes on each side.
