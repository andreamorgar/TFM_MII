Using a meat mallet, pound the chicken thighs to 1/4" thick. Place the garlic, paprika, caraway seeds, wine, salt and pepper in a medium bowl and mix to combine. Add the chicken and toss to combine. Refrigerate for 15 minutes to marinate. To make the spaetzle, place the flour, eggs, buttermilk and salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. In batches, push spoonfuls of the batter through the holes of a colander into the boiling water to make small dumplings. Cook for 1 minute or until the spaetzle rises to the surface. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. Repeat with the remaining batter. Keep spaetzle warm. Place the flour, salt and pepper in a medium bowl and mix to combine. Place the eggs and buttermilk in a separate bowl and whisk to combine. Place the breadcrumbs in a third bowl. Dust the marinated chicken with the flour, dip into the egg mixture and press into the breadcrumbs to coat. Pour oil into a large frying pan to a depth of 1" and heat over high heat. Cook the chicken in batches, turning, for 3–4 minutes or until golden and cooked through. Drain on paper towels, set aside and keep warm. Heat another large frying pan over high heat. Add the butter and cook for 3–4 minutes or until it starts to foam. Add the sage and cook for 1 minute. Add the spaetzle and toss to coat. Divide the schnitzels between serving plates, top with the spaetzle mixture and serve with lemon wedges.
