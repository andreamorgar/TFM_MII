Mash papaya flesh with a fork until smooth or pulse in a food processor until coarsely puréed. Add 5 tablespoons sugar and 2 tablespoons lime juice and stir or pulse to combine. Add more sugar and lime juice to taste (papayas vary in sweetness and acidity). Beat cream in a large bowl until it holds soft peaks, then fold in papaya mixture gently but thoroughly. Divide among 8 (6-ounce) glasses and chill at least 1 hour to allow flavors to develop.
