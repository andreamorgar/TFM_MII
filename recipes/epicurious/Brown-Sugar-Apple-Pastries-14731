Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 425°F. Unfold pastry sheet on work surface. Cut into 3 strips along fold lines. Cut strips in half crosswise. Transfer rectangles to baking sheet. Blend 2 tablespoons butter, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon in small bowl; spread over rectangles. Bake 10 minutes. Pierce crusts with fork to deflate; continue baking until bottoms are crisp, about 6 minutes. Meanwhile, melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add apples. Sauté until beginning to brown, about 8 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and lemon peel. Toss until syrup forms and apples are tender but still hold shape, about 5 minutes. Transfer crusts to platter. Top each with apples; drizzle with any syrup from skillet. Serve pastries warm or at room temperature with ice cream.
