Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in heavy Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season pork with salt and pepper. Add pork to pot and cook until brown, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer pork to plate. Add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil to pot. Add onions and sauté until very tender, about 12 minutes. Add garlic and cook 3 minutes. Return pork to pot. Add tomatoes with their juices, low-salt chicken broth, white wine, thyme and oregano. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered until pork is almost tender, about 1 hour. Add olives and continue cooking until pork is very tender and juices are slightly thickened, about 45 minutes. Add green beans to stew. Cover and cook over low heat until beans are just tender, about 8 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.
