Preheat oven to 350°F. Sift flour, baking powder and salt into large bowl. Add butter, yogurt and 2 eggs and stir to blend. Knead with hands in bowl until smooth soft dough forms. Transfer dough to floured surface. Roll out to 12-inch square, about 1/2 inch thick. Cut square into 13 strips, then cut each strip crosswise into 4 equal strips. Place strips on large baking sheet. Brush tops with yolks. Mix cheese and parsley in bowl. Sprinkle over strips. Bake until golden, about 30 minutes. Serve warm.
