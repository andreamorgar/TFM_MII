Chop enough shallots to measure 1 cup. In a heavy saucepan cook shallots in oil over moderate heat, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in soy sauce, water, sugar, jam, gingerroot, garlic, allspice, and red pepper flakes and simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 3/4 cup, about 20 minutes. Stir in lime juice and zest. (Glaze may be made 2 days ahead and cooled completely before being chilled, covered.)
