Heat olive oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until translucent, about 4 minutes. Add garlic, rosemary and sage and continue cooking 1 minute. Mix in tomatoes and cook until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Add broth and garbanzo beans and simmer 5 minutes. Puree soup in blender or processor. Return soup to saucepan and bring to boil. Stir in orzo and cook until orzo is just tender but still firm to bite. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle soup into bowls. Garnish with parsley and serve, passing Parmesan cheese separately.
