Place the milk, heavy cream, and vanilla bean in a small saucepan and gently bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and let infuse for 30 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean, scrape out the seeds, and add them back into the milk and cream mixture, discarding the pod. Whisk together the egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl and gradually pour in the milk mixture, whisking as you pour. Return the mixture to a clean saucepan and heat gently, stirring all the time, until it thickens enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Pour into a clean bowl and cover the surface with plastic wrap (so a skin doesn't form). Let cool completely. Pour into an ice cream machine and churn according to the manufacturer¿s directions. Alternatively, if you don't have a machine, place in a covered container in the freezer and beat the mixture every 30 minutes to get rid of any graininess which would otherwise spoil the finished texture. Keep freezing and beating until it becomes a smooth ice cream consistency. Then store in the freezer and use as described in the recipes.
