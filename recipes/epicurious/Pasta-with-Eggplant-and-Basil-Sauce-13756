Heat oil in heavy large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add bell peppers, onions, eggplant and garlic; sauté until onions are translucent, about 6 minutes. Add 1/2 cup basil, pine nuts, thyme and rosemary and sauté until eggplant softens, about 10 minutes. Mix in broth. Simmer sauce until eggplant is very tender and liquids begin to thicken, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over low heat before continuing.) Add penne to sauce in Dutch oven. Toss until sauce coats pasta. Transfer to large bowl. Sprinkle with Parmesan.
