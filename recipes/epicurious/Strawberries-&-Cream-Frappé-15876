Put the strawberries on a tray lined with plastic wrap and freeze uncovered for 2 hours or until they are frozen solid. Divide the frozen strawberries and ice into 4 batches and put the first batch in a blender or processor. Pulse about 5 or 6 times or until evenly crushed. Pour in a quarter of the sugar syrup and cream. Quickly blend for a few seconds just to incorporate the ingredients. Pour the frappé mixture into a pitcher and repeat with the remaining batches. Serve immediately, in glasses.
