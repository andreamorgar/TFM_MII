Cook tortellini in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain well. Meanwhile, heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; increase heat to high and sauté until onion is beginning to brown, about 6 minutes. Add tomatoes; sauté 3 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook 2 minutes. Add vermouth, then parsley, basil, olives, and oregano. Cook 4 minutes, stirring often. Add cooked tortellini; toss over medium heat until sauce coats pasta. Remove from heat. Stir in cheese. Season pasta to taste with salt and pepper and serve.
