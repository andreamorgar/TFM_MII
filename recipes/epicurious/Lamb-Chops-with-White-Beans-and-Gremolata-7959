Preheat oven to 400°F. Pat lamb chops dry and season with salt and pepper. Lightly spray a large shallow flameproof casserole or heavy ovenproof skillet (about 12 inches in diameter) with vegetable oil and heat over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. In casserole brown lamb chops about 1 1/2 minute on each side and tranfer to a plate. Add onion to casserole and cook, stirring, over moderately low heat until softened. Add tomatoes, garlic, and rosemary and cook over moderate heat, stirring, 1 minute. Stir in broth and beans and simmer, stirring occasionally, 3 minutes. Arrange lamb chops on top of bean mixture and roast, uncovered, in middle of oven 5 minutes for medium-rare. Let lamb chops and bean mixture stand, loosely covered, 5 minutes. Transfer lamb chops to another plate and toss bean mixture with gremolata. Serve lamb chops with beans.
