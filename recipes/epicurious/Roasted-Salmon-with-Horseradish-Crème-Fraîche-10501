Transfer to refrigerator and chill 1 hour. In medium bowl, whisk together crème fraïche, horseradish, vinegar, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Chill until ready to use. Preheat oven to 450°F. Oil large rimmed baking sheet. Using paper towels, pat salmon fillets dry. In large nonstick pan over moderately high heat, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil until hot but not smoking. Add 3 to 4 fillets, skin side down, and sear until undersides are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer, skin sides up, to baking sheet.
