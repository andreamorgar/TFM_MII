Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Line muffin cups with liners. Pulse crystallized ginger in food processor until finely ground, then add flour, ground ginger, cinnamon, zest, salt, baking soda, and baking powder and pulse until combined. Whisk together zucchini, oil, honey, eggs, and vanilla in a medium bowl, then stir in flour mixture until just combined. Divide batter among muffin cups and bake until golden and a wooden pick or skewer inserted in center of a cupcake comes out clean, 20 to 24 minutes. Cool in pan on a rack 10 minutes. Remove cupcakes from pan and cool completely, 1 hour. Beat together frosting ingredients with an electric mixer at high speed until combined well and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Frost tops of cooled cupcakes.
