Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook just until al dente, about 7 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a wide, deep sauté pan set over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until golden-brown, about 2 minutes. Add the anchovies and cook for 2 minutes more. Stir in the tomato puree and capers. Reserve 1/4 cup of the cooking liquid, then strain the pasta. Stir the olives and tuna into the sauce, then gradually stir in the reserved pasta water until the sauce attains a pleasing consistency. Add the hot pasta and toss. Season with pepper and toss again. To serve, divide the hot pasta among individual warmed bowls, topping each serving with some chopped parsley. Add 1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary to the sauce along with the black pepper.
