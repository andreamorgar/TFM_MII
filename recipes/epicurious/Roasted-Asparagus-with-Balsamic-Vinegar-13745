Preheat oven to 500°F. In a large shallow baking pan toss asparagus with oil and salt and pepper to taste until coated well. Roast asparagus, shaking pan every 2 minutes, until tender and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove pan from oven and drizzle vinegar over asparagus, shaking pan to combine well.
