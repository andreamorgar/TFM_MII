In a small saucepan combine the sugar and 3/4 cup water, bring the mixture to a simmer over moderate heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved, and simmer the syrup for 10 minutes. Let the syrup cool and chill it, covered, for 2 hours, or until it is cold. In a bowl stir together 1 cup chilled syrup, the Champagne, the orange juice, and the orange-flower water and freeze the mixture in an ice-cream freezer according to the manufacturer's instructions until it is frozen but still soft. In a bowl beat the white until it is frothy, add it to the sorbet, and freeze the sorbet in the freezer until it is firm.
