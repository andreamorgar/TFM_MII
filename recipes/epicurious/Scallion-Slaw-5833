Cut 2 bunches scallions into 3" lengths, then thinly slice lengthwise. Place in a bowl of ice water (to crisp). Just before serving, drain well, pat dry, and transfer to another bowl. Add 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar and 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil; toss to coat. Season with kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, and gochugaru (coarse Korean red pepper powder).
