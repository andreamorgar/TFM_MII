Toss cabbage with salt in a large bowl and let stand, stirring occasionally, 20 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk together oil, vinegar, honey mustard, and pepper in a small bowl until combined. Rinse cabbage with cold water in a colander, then firmly squeeze handfuls to remove excess water and transfer cabbage to cleaned bowl. Add radishes and dressing to cabbage, tossing to combine.
