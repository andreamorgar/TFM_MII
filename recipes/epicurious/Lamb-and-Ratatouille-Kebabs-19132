Thread lamb on skewers, alternating with vegetables. Prepare barbecue or preheat broiler. Brush kebabs with additional olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Grill or broil until lamb is slightly charred on outside and pink on inside and vegetables are tender, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes.
