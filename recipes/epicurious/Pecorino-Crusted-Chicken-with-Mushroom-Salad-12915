Toss first 5 ingredients in a medium bowl. Season generously with salt and pepper. Let stand at room temperature, tossing often, until mushrooms soften, 20-30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 500°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil; set a wire rack inside. Season chicken with salt and pepper; place on rack. Spread mayonnaise on chicken; sprinkle with cheese. Bake for 5 minutes. Turn on broiler. Broil until chicken is cooked through and cheese is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Serve with salad.
