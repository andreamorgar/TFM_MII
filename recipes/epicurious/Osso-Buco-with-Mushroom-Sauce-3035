Pat shanks dry between paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Arrange shanks on onion mixture and roast, covered tightly, in middle of oven 3 hours. (Meat will give off juices as it cooks.) Shanks may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and cooled, uncovered, before chilling, covered. Reheat shanks before proceeding.) Cut mushrooms into 1/4-inch-thick slices. in a large skillet heat remaining 2 tablespoons each of oil and butter over moderately high heat until foam begins to subside and sauté mushrooms with thyme and salt and pepper to taste, stirring, until mushrooms begin to give off their liquid.

Transfer shanks to a platter and keep warm. Transfer onions, celery, and pan juices to a blender with 1/2 cup water and purée until smooth, adding more water if necessary to thin sauce to desired consistency.
