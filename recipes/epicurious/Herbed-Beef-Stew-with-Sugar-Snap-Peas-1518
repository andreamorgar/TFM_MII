Return meat and any juices in bowl to Dutch oven. Stir in wine. Simmer until liquid is reduced to half, about 5 minutes. Add beef broth, tomatoes, half of thyme and half of rosemary. Season with salt and pepper. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until beef is almost tender, approximately 1 hour. Stir in carrots. Simmer uncovered until carrots and meat are very tender and stew is slightly thickened, approximately 45 minutes or less Stir in peas, parsley, remaining 1 tablespoon thyme and remaining 2 teaspoon rosemary.
