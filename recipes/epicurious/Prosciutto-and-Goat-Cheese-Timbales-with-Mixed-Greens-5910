Line six 2/3-cup ramekins with plastic wrap, leaving overhang. Line each ramekin with 2 slices prosciutto, overlapping in center and patching any holes with extra prosciutto. Stir goat cheese, cream cheese and 1/4 cup green onions in bowl until well blended. Season generously with pepper. Spoon into prepared ramekins, dividing equally. Fold prosciutto over to enclose. Fold plastic over to cover; press to compact. Chill overnight. Cook beans in medium pot of boiling salted water until just crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Drain; rinse with cold water and drain well. Pat dry. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.) Invert ramekins to release timbales. Peel off plastic. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add timbales, bottom side down. Cover; cook until cheese is just soft when top of timbale is pressed, about 5 minutes. Transfer to plate; let stand 1 hour to set up. Meanwhile, combine vinegar and shallots in small bowl. Slowly whisk in 1/2 cup oil. Season with salt and pepper. Combine greens, beans, 1/4 cup green onions and 2/3 cup dressing in large bowl; toss to coat. Divide salad among 6 plates. Top each with timbale. Drizzle some of remaining dressing over each.
