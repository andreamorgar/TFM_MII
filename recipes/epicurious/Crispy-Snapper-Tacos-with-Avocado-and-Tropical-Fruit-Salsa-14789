Heat 6 cups oil in a deep large saucepan over moderately high heat until a deep-fat thermometer registers 375°F, then fry taco shells, 2 at a time, turning occasionally, until a shade darker, about 1 minute. Transfer to paper towels to drain and season with salt. Whisk together lime juice, 3 tablespoons oil, and salt and pepper to taste for dressing. Season fish with salt and pepper. Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté scallions, stirring, 1 minute. Add fish and sauté, stirring occasionally, until just cooked through, about 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and gently toss fish with chipotles. Toss arugula with dressing and salt and pepper to taste. Fill taco shells with arugula, fish mixture, and salsa.
