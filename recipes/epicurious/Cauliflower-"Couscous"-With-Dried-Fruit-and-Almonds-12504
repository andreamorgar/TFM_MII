Toast almonds in a large dry skillet over medium heat, tossing occasionally, until lightly browned, 8–10 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl. Wipe out skillet. Meanwhile, working in batches if needed, pulse cauliflower in a food processor fitted with blade, or grate using the largest holes of a box grater until rice-like in texture (you should have about 4 cups). Whisk broth and honey together in a small bowl. Heat oil in same skillet over medium-high. Add cumin, turmeric, paprika, and cinnamon and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Immediately add cauliflower and stir to coat. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until cauliflower is softened, 3–5 minutes. Add broth mixture, currants, and apricots; stir to combine. Cover and continue to cook until just tender, 3–5 minutes more. Transfer cauliflower mixture to a serving platter and stir in half of almonds. Top with remaining almonds before serving.
