Preheat oven to 500°F. Peel potatoes and halve lengthwise, then cut each half lengthwise into 4 wedges. Transfer to a shallow baking pan and toss with oil to coat. Combine salt and spices and sprinkle over potatoes. Roast potatoes in lower third of oven, turning over halfway through roasting, until tender and browned, 15 to 20 minutes total.
