Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic and sauté until tender and golden, about 5 minutes. Add chopped rabbit; sauté until light brown, about 4 minutes. Add wine and boil until slightly reduced, about 3 minutes. Stir in chopped tomatoes, crushed tomatoes, 1 cup basil, crushed red pepper, and remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until sauce thickens slightly, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes. Season sauce generously with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain. Return pasta to pot. Add sauce; toss to coat. Transfer to bowl. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup basil and Parmesan cheese.
