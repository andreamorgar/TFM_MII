Heat a dry "comal" or flat iron griddle over moderately low heat until hot and pan-roast tomatoes, onion, and garlic, turning them occasionally to ensure even roasting, until brown and soft throughout, about 15 minutes. Discard tomato stems and garlic skin. Chop tomatoes, onion and garlic coarse and in a bowl stir together with remaining ingredients. (Salsa should be chunky.) Salsa may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.
