In a 5-quart kettle bring 4 quarts salted water to a boil for pasta. In a small saucepan bring 1 1/2 cups water and tomatoes to a boil. Remove pan from heat and let tomatoes stand until softened, about 15 minutes. Drain tomatoes, reserving 1/2 cup soaking liquid, and chop. In a large bowl stir together tomatoes, reserved soaking liquid, olives, and parsley. Cook pasta in boiling water until al dente, adding peas and zucchini during last minute of cooking. Drain pasta mixture well in a colander and add to tomato mixture with salt and pepper to taste, tossing until most of liquid is absorbed.
