Using a homogenizing juicer with the blank plate in place, homogenize the garbanzo beans and parsley and place in a large bowl. Place the tahini, lemon juice, onion, cumin, and Braggs in a blender and blend. Stir the tahini mixture into the garbanzo paste. In a spice grinder, grind the sesame seeds into a fine powder. Mix into the garbanzo paste. Press into 1/4-inch-thick crusts, each 4 or 8 inches in diameter. Dehydrate for 12 to 14 hours, flipping at least once during the drying time.
