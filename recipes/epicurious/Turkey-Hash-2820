Generously cover potatoes with cold water, then simmer, partially covered, until just tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain. Cool slightly, then peel and coarsely grate with a box grater. While potatoes cool, melt 6 tablespoons butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and cook onion and peppers, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Add potatoes, turkey, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and cook, turning occasionally, until browned in spots, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer hash to plates. Fry eggs in remaining Tbsp butter in skillet over medium heat. Serve on top of hash.
