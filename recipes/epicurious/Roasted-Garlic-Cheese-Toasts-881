Preheat oven to 350°F. Place garlic, cut side up, in small glass baking dish; pour oil over each head and sprinkle with salt. Cover; bake until garlic is tender, about 1 hour. Uncover; let cool 15 minutes. Squeeze garlic from each clove into medium bowl and mash. Mix in Parmesan, cream cheese, mayonnaise, and thyme. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made one day ahead; cover and refrigerate. Allow to soften slightly at room temperature before continuing.) Preheat oven temperature to 425°F. Spread garlic mixture on bread slices; arrange on 2 baking sheets. Bake until toasts are beginning to brown at edges, about 12 minutes.
