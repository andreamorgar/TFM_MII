Cook green beans in a large pot of boiling salted water (2 Tbsp salt for 6 qt water) just until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to an ice bath, then drain and pat dry. Add lima beans and black-eyed peas to boiling water and simmer until tender, 16 to 18 minutes. Drain and pat dry. While limas and peas simmer, whisk together lemon juice, 1 1/2 tsp salt, and 3/4 tsp pepper in a large bowl, then whisk in oil and scallions. Add lima beans and black-eyed peas while still hot and toss well. Cool 15 minutes, then add green beans, tossing well.
