In a food processor, finely mince the garlic cloves. Combine the remaining ingredients in a large measuring cup. Add to the garlic and pulse until completely blended. Use a rubber spatula to stir the ingredients and pulse again if necessary. Transfer some of the seasoning salt to small containers with shakers and the remainder to an airtight container. Store for up to 3 months in the refrigerator.
