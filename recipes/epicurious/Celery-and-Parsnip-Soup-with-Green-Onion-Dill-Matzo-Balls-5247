Melt margarine in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add next 5 ingredients. Cover; cook 10 minutes. Add 6 cups stock; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer uncovered until vegetables are very tender, about 15 minutes. Working in batches, puree soup in blender until very smooth, adding celery leaves to each batch. Return to pot. Thin with more broth, if desired. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Chill until cold. Cover; keep chilled.) Rewarm soup. Serve with Green Onion-Dill Matzo Balls.
