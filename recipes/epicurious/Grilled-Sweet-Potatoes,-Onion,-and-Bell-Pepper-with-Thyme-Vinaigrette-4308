Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Whisk oil and thyme in small bowl to blend. Place sweet potatoes, onion, and bell pepper in large bowl. Drizzle with 1/4 cup oil mixture and toss to coat. Grill vegetables until tender and slightly charred, turning often, about 15 minutes for pepper and about 20 minutes for sweet potatoes and onion. Transfer vegetables to platter. Whisk vinegar into remaining oil mixture. Season vinaigrette with salt and pepper; drizzle over vegetables. Serve warm or at room temperature.
