Bring sugar, water, and 1 cup mint to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and let steep, covered, 10 minutes. Pour syrup through a sieve into a large serving bowl, pressing on and discarding mint, and cool syrup. Cut peel and white pith from oranges with a sharp knife. Holding oranges over bowl of syrup to catch any juices, cut sections free from membranes, letting them fall into syrup, and squeeze membranes to extract as much juice as possible.
