With poultry shears or a sharp knife cut off necks, feet, and first 2 wing joints of each quail and discard. Cut out and discard backbones and halve each quail lengthwise through breast. Mince garlic and mash to a paste with salt. In a small heavy skillet heat garlic paste and paprika in oil over moderate heat, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat and stir in lime juice and cayenne. Pat quail dry and season with pepper and salt. Divide oil and butter between two 12-inch heavy skillets and heat over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Add quail and sauté, skin sides down, until skin is golden, about 2 minutes. Turn quail over and sauté 2 minutes more. Turn quail skin sides down and sauté 1 minute more, or until skin is golden brown but meat is barely pink for medium. Serve quail with Moroccan vegetables and bulgur pilaf or couscous. Drizzle paprika sauce over and around vegetables and quail.
