In a heavy skillet sauté the onions in the butter over moderately high heat, stirring, until they are golden brown and transfer them to a plate. In a bowl toss the chicken livers, patted dry, with the flour and salt and pepper to taste, heat the oil in the skillet over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking, and in it sauté the chicken livers, turning them, for 3 minutes, or until they are just cooked through but still pink within. Add the onions, the Port, and 3 tablespoons water and cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring, for 2 minutes, or until the liquid is thickened. Stir in 2 tablespoons of the parsley and salt and pepper to taste, divide the mixture between 2 heated plated, and top each serving with half the remaining parsley and half the hazelnuts. Toast the hazelnuts in one layer in a baking pan in a preheated 350°F. oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they are colored lightly and the skins blister. Wrap the nuts in a kitchen towel and let them steam for 1 minute. Rub the nuts in the towel to remove the skins and let them cool.
