Mix honey, mustard, wine, oil and 3 tablespoons vinegar in medium bowl. Transfer 3/4 cup honey-mustard sauce to small bowl and set aside to use at serving time. Place chicken in large roasting pan. Pour remaining honey-mustard sauce over. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to 4 hours. Preheat oven to 350°F. Remove chicken from marinade; reserve marinade. Place chicken, skin side up, on rimmed baking sheet. Roast chicken 55 minutes, basting occasionally with reserved marinade and pan drippings. Increase heat to 400°F. Roast chicken until skin is deep golden brown and juices run clear when thickest part of thigh is pierced, about 15 minutes. Toss frisée in large bowl with enough reserved honey-mustard sauce to coat. Season with additional vinegar, salt and pepper. Divide salad among plates. Top with chicken. Ganish with tomatoes, if desired. Serve, passing remaining sauce separately.
