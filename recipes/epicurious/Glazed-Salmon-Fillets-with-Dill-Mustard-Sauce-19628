Make glaze and sauce: In a bowl whisk together vinegar, mustard, and brown sugar. Whisk in oil in a stream until emulsified and season with pepper and salt. Mixture may be made 3 days ahead and chilled, covered. Bring mixture to room temperature and whisk before proceeding. Transfer 3/4 cup mixture to a small bowl and stir in soy sauce to make glaze. Whisk dill into remaining mixture to make sauce. Preheat broiler and grease a broiler pan or jelly-roll pan. Rinse salmon fillets and pat dry. Arrange fillets, skin sides down, in pan. (Cook 1 at a time if broiler is small.) Brush salmon with glaze and season with pepper and salt. Broil salmon 3 to 4 inches from heat about 8 minutes, or until just cooked through. Serve salmon warm or at room temperature with sauce.
