Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter 9x9x2-inch metal baking pan. Combine cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and salt in processor; blend 5 seconds. Add butter; process until mixture resembles coarse meal. Whisk buttermilk, eggs, and maple syrup in large bowl. Add cornmeal mixture; stir just until evenly moistened (do not overblend). Transfer to prepared pan. Bake bread until golden and cracked on top and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool bread in pan on rack. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; store at room temperature.)
