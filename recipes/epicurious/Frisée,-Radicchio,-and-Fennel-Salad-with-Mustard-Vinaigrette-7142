Heat oven to 350°F with rack in middle. Spread pine nuts in a small baking sheet and bake until pale golden, about 8 minutes. Let cool. Using mandoline, thinly slice fennel bulb crosswise, beginning at base, into a large bowl, stopping about halfway up bulb (reserve remaining bulb for another use). Toss fennel with radicchio, frisée, and mint. Whisk together oil, vinegar, shallot, Dijon mustard, and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper in a small bowl. Toss salad well with vinaigrette and pine nuts. Season to taste, if necessary, with salt and pepper.
