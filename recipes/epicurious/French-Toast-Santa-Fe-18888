Preheat oven to 400°F. Cut off and discard crusts from bread, then diagonally halve slices. Arrange in 1 layer in a baking pan. Whisk together cream, eggs, and salt, then pour over bread. Soak bread, turning once, until most of liquid is absorbed but bread is not falling apart, about 2 minutes. Carefully transfer soaked bread with a slotted spatula to a tray. Heat 1/2 inch oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until thermometer registers 325°F. Fry bread, 3 pieces at a time, turning over once, until golden brown and crisp, about 2 minutes. (Return oil to 325°F between batches.) Transfer toast to paper towels to drain briefly, then arrange in 1 layer on a baking sheet. Once all bread is fried, bake toast in middle of oven until puffed, about 4 minutes. Serve dusted with confectioners sugar.
