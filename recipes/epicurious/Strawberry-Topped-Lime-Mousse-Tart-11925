Blend first 4 ingredients in processor until nuts are ground but some small pieces still remain. Add butter; cut in using on/off turns until mixture resembles fine meal. Blend in enough water by teaspoonfuls until mixture begins to form clumps. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Press dough evenly over bottom and up sides of 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Freeze crust until firm, about 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375°F. Bake crust until deep golden brown, about 30 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool. Place lime juice in small bowl; sprinkle gelatin over. Let stand 10 minutes to soften. Bring 1/4 cup cream to simmer in medium saucepan. Reduce heat to low. Add white chocolate; stir until melted and smooth. Add gelatin mixture; stir to dissolve. Mix in peel. Chill until cold and beginning to thicken but not set, stirring often, about 45 minutes. Beat sugar, sour cream and remaining 1/2 cup cream to medium-stiff peaks in medium bowl. Fold whipped cream mixture into white chocolate mixture. Spoon mousse into crust. Chill until mousse sets, about 4 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Decoratively arrange berries atop mousse. Melt jam in small saucepan over low heat, stirring often. Brush enough jam over berries to glaze. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover; chill.)
