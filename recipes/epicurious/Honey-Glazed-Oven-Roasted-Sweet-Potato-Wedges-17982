Preheat oven to 400°F. Peel sweet potatoes, then quarter lengthwise. Rinse potatoes with cold water; pat dry with paper towels. Place potatoes in large bowl; add olive oil and salt and toss to coat. Arrange in single layer on rimmed baking sheet. Roast 45 minutes. Brush with honey and roast until tender and beginning to brown in spots, about 15 minutes longer. Transfer to platter; sprinkle with parsley and serve.
