Arrange half the tortillas in one layer on a large baking sheet and brush them lightly with some of the butter. Turn the tortillas over, divide the Monterey Jack, the corn, and the chilies evenly among them, and top the mixture with the remaining tortillas. Brush the tops lightly with some of the remaining butter and broil the quesadillas under a preheated broiler about 2 inches from the heat for 1 minute, or until the tops are golden and crisp. Turn the quesadillas carefully with a spatula, brush the tops lightly with the remaining butter, and broil the quesadillas for 1 minute more, or until the tops are golden and crisp. Serve the quesadillas, cut into wedges, with the guacamole and the salsa.
