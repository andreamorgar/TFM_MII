Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter twelve 1/3-cup metal muffin cups. Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Add corn and chili powder. Sauté 3 minutes. Transfer to medium bowl. Mix in buttermilk, then eggs. Cool completely. Whisk cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda in large bowl to blend. Add buttermilk mixture; stir just until blended. Divide batter among prepared muffin cups. Bake until tester inserted into center of muffins comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Transfer muffins to rack. Cool slightly. (Can be made 2 weeks ahead. Cool completely. Wrap in foil, seal in plastic bag and freeze. Rewarm muffins wrapped in foil in 350°F oven until heated through, about 8 minutes.)
