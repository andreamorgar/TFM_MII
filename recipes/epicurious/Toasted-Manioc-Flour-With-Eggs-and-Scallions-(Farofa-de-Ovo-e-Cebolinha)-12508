Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Add the manioc flour and toast it to a light golden color, stirring often, 8 to 10 minutes. Make sure to stir constantly, otherwise the flour will burn. Set aside. In a nonstick skillet, warm the olive oil over medium heat, and cook the scallions until they just start to soften. Save a few slices of scallion for garnish. Whisk the eggs in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper. Pour the eggs into the scallions and scramble them lightly, being careful not to overcook them. Add the toasted manioc flour and stir everything together. Season with salt and pepper. Pour into a serving dish and garnish with the reserved scallions.
