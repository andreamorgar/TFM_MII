Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and sauté until just soft, about 5 minutes. Add sausage; sauté until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add rice and stir to coat with pan juices. Mix in potatoes, broth, wine, pimientos with juices and turmeric. Season with salt, pepper and cayenne. Bring to boil; stir well. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook until rice and potatoes are tender and liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Mix in shrimp and chopped cilantro. Cover and cook until shrimp are just cooked through, about 4 minutes. Mound jambalaya on large platter. Garnish with cilantro sprigs and serve.
