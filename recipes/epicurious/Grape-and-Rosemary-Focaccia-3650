Preheat oven to 300°F. In a baking dish large enough to hold grapes in one layer cook grapes in middle of oven 30 minutes, or until soft and sticky, and cool slightly. In a standing electric mixer fitted with paddle attachment beat together yeast, sugar, and water and let stand 5 minutes, or until foamy. Add flour, table salt, and oil and combine well. With dough hook knead dough 2 minutes, or until soft and slightly sticky. Form dough into a ball and let rest on a floured surface, covered with an inverted bowl, 10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface roll dough into an 18- by 8-inch oval. Arrange oval diagonally on greased large baking sheet and sprinkle with grapes, rosemary, coarse salt, and pepper. Let dough rise, covered loosely with plastic wrap, in a warm place for 1 hour, or until almost doubled in bulk. Preheat oven to 375°F. Bake focaccia in middle of oven 1 hour, or until golden, and cool on a baking sheet on a rack. Serve focaccia warm or at room temperature.
