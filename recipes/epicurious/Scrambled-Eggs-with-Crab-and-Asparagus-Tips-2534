Peel the asparagus stalks thinly with a vegetable peeler and cut off the tips leaving about 1 1/2-inch (4-cm) stalk attached to them. Cook in boiling salted water for 2 to 3 minutes; the asparagus should be firm but not crunchy. Refresh in cold water and keep at room temperature. Melt the butter in a heavy pan, add the beaten eggs, and scramble (click here for instuctions). Add the cream at the end of cooking and season with salt and pepper. Steam the crabmeat or shelled claws for 2 to 3 minutes to heat them, then add the asparagus and steam for another minute, until just hot. Divide the scrambled eggs between 4 plates. Place 2 crab claws or a pile of crabmeat in the center, arrange the asparagus tips around the crab, scatter with the chives, and serve at once.
