Heat heavy large skillet over high heat. Cook duck, skin side down, until skin is dark brown and fat is rendered, about 5 minutes. Turn duck over and cook to desired doneness, about 6 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer to platter. Tent with foil to keep warm. Pour off drippings from skillet. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in same skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and gherkins and sauté until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add stock and honey and boil until syrupy, about 5 minutes. Stir in all peppercorns and simmer 1 minute. Remove from heat. Add remaining 1 tablespoon butter and whisk until sauce is smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Slice duck crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick slices. Fan duck slices on plates. Spoon peppercorn sauce over and serve.
