In medium bowl, stir together plums, ginger, and vinegar. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Prepare grill for cooking: If using charcoal grill, open vents on bottom, then light charcoal. Charcoal fire is medium-hot when you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 4 to 5 seconds. If using gas grill, preheat burners on high with hood closed 10 minutes, then turn down to moderately high. Rub salmon fillets on both sides with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Arrange fillets on grill, skin sides down. Grill, turning once, until just cooked through, about 6 to 8 minutes per side, brushing with hoisin sauce during last 30 seconds of cooking on each side. Transfer fillets to platter and sprinkle with scallions and sesame seeds. Serve, passing plum relish on side.
