Slice fennel lengthwise 1/4 inch thick. Coarsely crush almonds by firmly rolling over them with a rolling pin. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then sauté fennel with garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper until crisp-tender, about 6 minutes. Stir in almonds, raisins, coriander, zest, juice, and saffron and sauté until raisins start to plump, about 2 minutes. Stir in cilantro just before serving at room temperature.
