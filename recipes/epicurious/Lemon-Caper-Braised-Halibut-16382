Season the halibut with salt and pepper. Coat a medium nonstick skillet with cooking spray; place over medium-high heat. Add the fish; cook for 5 minutes per side, until cooked through. Transfer to a platter and cover to keep warm. Reduce the heat to low. Add the oil, tomatoes, capers, and lemon juice; cook for 1 minute, stirring. Arrange the spinach on 2 serving plates; top with the fish. Spoon the sauce over the halibut and garnish with the parsley. Serve with the bread.
