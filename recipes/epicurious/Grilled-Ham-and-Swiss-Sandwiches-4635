Spread 1 side of each bread slice with mustard. Divide half of cheese and all of ham between 2 bread slices; top with remaining cheese. Tuck in cheese and ham around edges. Sprinkle each with 1/2 teaspoon dill. Top with remaining bread, mustard side down, to form sandwiches. Whisk egg and remaining 3 teaspoons dill in 9-inch pie dish. Brush both sides of sandwiches with egg mixture. Melt butter in medium skillet over medium heat. Add sandwiches; cover. Cook until sandwiches are golden and cheese melts, about 6 minutes per side. Cut in half diagonally and serve.
