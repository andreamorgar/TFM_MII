Combine all ingredients in large pot. Set pot over medium heat and bring mixture to simmer. Cook until apples are tender and cranberries are plump, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate until compote is well chilled, about 2 hours. (Compote can be prepared up to 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.)
