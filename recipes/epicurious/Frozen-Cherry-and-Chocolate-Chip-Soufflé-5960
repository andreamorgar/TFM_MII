Combine cherries, 2/3 cup sugar and 6 teaspoons lemon juice in heavy large saucepan. Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium; simmer until cherries are soft, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Transfer mixture to blender; add 2 teaspoons kirsch, vanilla and almond extracts and remaining 2 teaspoons lemon juice. Puree until very smooth. Chill until cold. Cut one 30x11-inch foil strip. Fold foil strip in half lengthwise. Wrap tightly around 6-cup soufflé dish, forming collar that extends from base of dish to above rim. Secure ends of foil with paper clips. Whisk egg yolks, cherry juice, 2/3 cup sugar and 2 teaspoons kirsch in large metal bowl to blend. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water). Whisk constantly until mixture thickens and thermometer inserted into mixture registers 140°F for 3 minutes, about 8 minutes total. Remove bowl from over water. Set bowl in another large bowl filled with ice and water; whisk constantly until mixture is cool, about 5 minutes. Beat cream in medium bowl until peaks form. Fold cherry puree into yolk mixture, then fold in whipped cream and chocolate chips. Transfer mixture to soufflé dish (mixture will extend above rim of dish). Freeze overnight. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover; keep frozen.) Run small knife between soufflé and foil. Peel off foil. Using small metal spatula or knife, smooth exposed sides of soufflé. Serve immediately.
