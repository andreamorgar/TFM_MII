Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-low heat. Add onion, garlic, bay leaves, and guajillo chili; sauté until onion is tender, about 8 minutes. Add clams and sauté 2 minutes. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup parsley. Add Sherry and lemon juice. Increase heat to medium-high, cover, and simmer until clams open (discard any that do not open), about 8 minutes. Transfer clams to shallow bowl. Boil sauce until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over clams. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons parsley and serve. Available at Latin American markets and some supermarkets.
