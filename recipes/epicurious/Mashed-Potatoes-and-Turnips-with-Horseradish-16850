Cover potatoes with salted cold water by 2 inches in a large pot and simmer, uncovered, until very tender, 20 to 30 minutes (depending on size of potatoes). Drain potatoes in a colander and, when just cool enough to handle, peel. Transfer potatoes to a bowl. While potatoes are cooking, cover turnips with salted cold water by 2 inches in a large pot and simmer, uncovered, until very tender, 10 to 20 minutes (depending on freshness of turnips). Drain turnips in colander and immediately add to warm potatoes, then mash with butter and horseradish. Season with sugar (to taste), salt, and pepper and stir in parsley.
