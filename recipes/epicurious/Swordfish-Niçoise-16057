1. Sprinkle the garlic with a generous pinch of salt; finely mince and place in a large shallow bowl with the vinegar. Slowly drizzle in 1/3 cup olive oil, whisking constantly to make a vinaigrette. Season with pepper. 2. Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water until tender but not mushy, about 10 minutes. Drain. Slice the potatoes and place in a bowl. Layer the green beans atop the potatoes, followed by the red pepper, onion, olives, capers, and slivered fresh basil. Do not toss this salad until serving time. 3. Preheat the broiler. Meanwhile, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper in a bowl. Add the fish; coat well. Let rest 15 minutes. 4. Place the fish on a lightly oiled broiler pan, 4 inches from the heat source, and broil for 4 minutes on the first side. Turn carefully and broil 4 minutes on the other side. Remove to the center of a platter. 5. Gently toss the salad from underneath and surround the swordfish. Sprinkle the chopped egg on top. Grind some pepper over all and garnish with chopped parsley.
