Combine cranberries, sugar and Port in heavy large saucepan. Bring mixture to boil over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to medium-low; add chopped orange and simmer until cranberries burst and mixture thickens slightly, about 15 minutes. Mix in dried currants. Cool cranberry conserve completely. Stir in chopped walnuts. (Cranberry conserve can be prepared 3 days ahead. Cover tightly and refrigerate.)
