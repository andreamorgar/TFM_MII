Preheat oven to 425°F. Using heavy 10-inch nonstick ovenproof skillet, fry bacon over medium-high heat until brown and crisp. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Crumble bacon. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons bacon drippings from skillet. Add leeks to skillet and sauté over medium heat until tender and beginning to brown, about 8 minutes. Combine eggs, milk, flour, mustard and sugar in processor and blend until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Scatter bacon over leeks in skillet. Pour egg mixture over. Sprinkle Gouda over. Transfer to oven and bake until pancake puffs and cheese melts, about 15 minutes. Loosen pancake from skillet. Cut into wedges and serve.
