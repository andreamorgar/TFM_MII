Stir berries, 2/3 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until mixture comes to boil, stirring occasionally. Puree mixture in processor. Strain into bowl, pressing on solids. Mix in kirsch. (Sauce can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill.) Blend flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in large bowl. Whisk buttermilk, eggs and 2 tablespoons melted butter in medium bowl; whisk mixture into dry ingredients. Set batter aside. Preheat oven to 250°F. Heat 4 tablespoons butter in large skillet over medium heat. Add apples, cinnamon and 1/3 cup sugar; sauté until apples are golden, about 10 minutes. Heat 10-inch-diameter nonstick skillet over medium heat. Brush with 1 tablespoon melted butter. Pour scant 1/2 cup batter into skillet, tilting to form 7- to 8-inch-diameter pancake. Cook until golden brown on bottom, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook until second side browns, about 2 minutes. Place 1/8 of apple mixture on half of pancake; fold pancake in half. Slide out onto baking sheet; keep warm in oven. Repeat to form 5 more pancakes, brushing skillet with more butter as needed. Serve pancakes with sauce.
