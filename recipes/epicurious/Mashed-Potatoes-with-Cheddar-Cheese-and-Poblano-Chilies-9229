Char poblano chilies directly over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides. Enclose in paper bag; let stand 10 minutes. Peel, seed, and chop chilies. Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 18 minutes. Drain potatoes; return to same pot. Add milk and butter and mash potatoes well. Mix in cheese and chilies. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Stir over medium-low heat to rewarm before continuing.) Transfer potatoes to bowl and serve. *Fresh green chilies, often called pasillas; available at Latin American markets and some supermarkets.
