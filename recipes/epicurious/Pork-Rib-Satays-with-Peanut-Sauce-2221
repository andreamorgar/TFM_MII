Mix first 9 ingredients in resealable plastic bag. Add ribs. Seal bag; turn to coat ribs with marinade. Chill overnight. Preheat oven to 350°F. Line large roasting pan with long piece of foil, overlapping each short side by 10 inches. Place ribs and marinade on foil in pan. Spoon some marinade over ribs. Fold foil over, enclosing ribs loosely in foil. Bake until ribs are tender, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Cool ribs slightly. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Keep ribs enclosed in foil in pan and refrigerate.) Prepare barbecue (medium heat) or preheat broiler. Unwrap ribs. Using tongs, transfer ribs to work surface. Cut rib sections between bones into individual ribs. If broiling, place ribs on baking sheet. Grill or broil ribs until well browned, about 3 minutes per side. Place ribs on platter. Arrange vegetables and Peanut Sauce alongside.
