Spread each of 4 slices of bread with 3 ounces of Boursin cheese. Cut each bacon slice in half lengthwise. Place 2 pieces of bacon (4 halves) on top of each of the Boursin-prepared slices of bread. Cover each prepared half with another slice of bread. Evenly butter the top of each sandwich. Place each sandwich butter side down in a frying pan over medium heat. While the first side is grilling, butter the second side of bread. Cook until golden and crusty, about 1-2 minutes. Carefully turn and cook until second side is golden, about 1-2 minutes more.
