Combine first 6 ingredients in small bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 day. (Can be prepared 4 days ahead. Keep refrigerated.) Preheat broiler. Spray 2 rimmed baking sheets with vegetable oil spray. Cut salmon crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Arrange slices in single layer on baking sheets. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Working in batches, broil until salmon is just opaque in center, about 2 minutes (do not turn salmon over). Cover; chill until cold, at least 1 hour or overnight. Arrange salmon slices on platter. Serve salmon chilled or let stand up to 1 hour at room temperature. Pass tartar sauce separately.
