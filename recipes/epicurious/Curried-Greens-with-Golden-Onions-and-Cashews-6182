Cook onion with salt to taste in 3 tablespoons oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until deep golden and some wedges are crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together spices. Add cashews to onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until nuts are 1 shade darker, about 3 minutes. Stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons spice mix and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove skillet from heat. Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a 5-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then cook remaining spice mix, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Immediately stir in the 3 greens and water and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of liquid is evaporated and greens are tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt. Serve greens sprinkled with onion mixture.
