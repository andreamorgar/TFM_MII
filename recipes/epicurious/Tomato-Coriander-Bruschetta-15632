Preheat oven to 400°F. Stir coriander seeds in heavy small skillet over medium heat until aromatic, about 1 minute. Cool seeds 10 minutes. Place in plastic bag; crush coarsely with mallet. Combine tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, and crushed red pepper on rimmed baking sheet; toss to blend. Sprinkle generously with salt. Bake until tomatoes are golden brown and soft, about 15 minutes, then broil until brown in spots, about 2 minutes. Mix in coriander and marjoram. Cool topping on sheet 15 minutes. Arrange bread slices on baking sheet. Bake until just beginning to color, about 5 minutes. Mound tomato topping on toasts. Arrange on platter and serve.
