Peel and quarter potatoes, then cover with salted cold water by 1 inch in a large saucepan and simmer, uncovered, until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. While potatoes are simmering, heat butter over moderately high heat in a large nonstick skillet and sauté scallion, stirring, until just tender, about 6 minutes. Drain potatoes in a colander and return to saucepan. Mash hot potatoes with milk using a potato masher until smooth, then stir in scallion, parsley, salt, and pepper.
