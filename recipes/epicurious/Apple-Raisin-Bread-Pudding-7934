Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375°F. Arrange bread in 1 layer on a large (17- by 13-inch) baking sheet and toast until pale golden, 10 to 12 minutes, then cool on baking sheet. Leave oven on. Meanwhile, toss apples with 3 tablespoons sugar in a bowl until coated. Cook in a dry 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat, swirling skillet and turning slices over occasionally, until tender and pale golden, about 15 minutes. Combine bread and apples in a 2-quart soufflé or 2-inch-deep baking dish (about 8- by 12-inch oval). Whisk together half-and-half, eggs, and remaining 1/2 cup sugar with 1/4 teaspoon salt in a bowl, then pour mixture over bread and apples. Let soak at room temperature 15 minutes. Bake in a water bath until edge is set but center still trembles slightly when dish is gently shaken, 50 minutes to 1 hour for soufflé dish or 35 to 40 minutes for shallow dish. Cool pudding to warm in baking dish on a rack, about 1 hour. (Pudding will continue to set as it cools.)
