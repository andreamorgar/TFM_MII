Chop enough scallions (including greens) to measure about 1 1/4 cups and in a blender purée with oil and salt and pepper to taste until smooth. Pour purée through a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing hard on solids. Discard solids. Scallion oil may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring oil to room temperature before using. In a large saucepan cover potatoes with salted cold water by 1 inch and simmer until just tender, about 7 minutes. In a colander drain potatoes and rinse under cold water to stop cooking. Pat potatoes dry. Potatoes may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Halve potatoes lengthwise. In a bowl toss potatoes with 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Peel and devein shrimp. Remove tough muscle from side of each scallop if necessary. Pat shellfish dry and in a bowl toss with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and salt and pepper to taste. Prepare grill. Grill potatoes, cut sides down, on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until lightly charred. Grill shrimp and scallops 2 minutes on each side, or until just cooked through and golden brown. (Alternatively, sauté potatoes and shellfish in a lightly oiled non-stick skillet in batches over moderately high heat.) Spoon salsa onto centers of 6 plates and mound mesclun on top. Arrange shellfish and potatoes around salsa and greens (see photograph, page 72). Drizzle shellfish and potatoes with some scallion oil and drizzle greens with some coulis. Serve remaining scallion oil and coulis on the side.
