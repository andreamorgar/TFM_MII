Cook shrimp in a 4-quart saucepan of boiling salted water until just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain in a colander and rinse under cold water to stop cooking. Shell shrimp. Whisk heavy cream until it holds soft peaks, then whisk in sour cream, horseradish, and salt and pepper to taste. Halve, pit, and peel avocados, then slice crosswise. Drizzle slices with lemon juice. Spread butter evenly on 1 side of each bread slice and put lettuce on top. Arrange shrimp, avocado, and onion over it. Spoon dollops of horseradish sauce on sandwiches and top with capers.
