Place coriander seeds in heavy small skillet. Heat over medium-high heat until fragrant and dark in color, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and cool. Place in blender. Add chopped shallot and red wine vinegar. Blend until coriander seeds are chopped, about 1 minute. Add olive oil and blend well. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Bring mixture to room temperature before using.) Cook bacon in large nonstick skillet over medium heat until crisp. Transfer bacon to paper towels; reserve bacon drippings. Whisk bacon drippings into dressing. Season dressing with salt and pepper. Crumble bacon. Combine curly endive, radishes and bacon in large bowl. Add enough dressing to coat salad; toss to blend.
