Cover potatoes with salted water by 1 inch in a large saucepan, then simmer, uncovered, until just tender, about 15 minutes. Drain in a colander and cool. Stir together salmon, fennel bulb, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Halve cooled potatoes and season cut sides with salt and pepper. Arrange, cut sides up, on a platter (if potatoes wobble, cut a thin slice off rounded bottoms), then dot each with 1/2 teaspoon sour cream. Mound salmon on top.
