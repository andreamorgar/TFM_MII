Place rosemary, orange peel, and peppercorns on large square of 3 layers of moistened cheesecloth. Gather cheesecloth and tie securely. Combine bouquet garni and all remaining ingredients in large saucepan. Bring to boil over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until fruit is tender and liquid is thick and syrupy, stirring occasionally, about 35 minutes. Transfer compote with bouquet garni to bowl; chill until cold, at least 6 hours and up to 2 days. Using tongs, remove bouquet garni; serve.
