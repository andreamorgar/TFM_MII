Preheat oven to 400° F. and butter a 9-by-5-by-3 inch loaf pan. Into a large bowl sift together flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda and whisk in cornmeal and sugar until combined well. In a bowl whisk together milk, molasses, and egg until just combined. Add butter to flour mixture and with an electric mixer beat until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Beat in milk mixture until just combined. Pour batter into pan and bake in middle of oven 35 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Cool corn bread in pan on a rack 10 minutes and turn out onto rack to cool completely. Corn bread may be made 2 days ahead and kept, wrapped in plastic wrap, in a cool, dry place.
