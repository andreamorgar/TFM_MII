Slice 1/2 pink grapefruit, 1/2 navel orange, and 1 lemon crosswise into paper-thin rounds; remove seeds. Toss in a medium bowl with 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Roast on a parchment-lined baking sheet in a 350° oven until golden in spots and crisp, 20–30 minutes; let cool. Meanwhile, cut all peel and white pith from 1 pink grapefruit, 1 navel orange, and 2 lemons. Working over a medium bowl, cut along sides of membranes to release segments into bowl; discard membranes. Tear roasted citrus into pieces and toss with segments, breaking up larger segments. Stir in 1/4 cup parsley leaves; season with flaky sea salt (such as Maldon).
