Combine bell peppers, garlic and 6 1/2 tablespoons oil in large bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and let stand at room temperature 2 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Refrigerate.) Cook linguine in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain. Meanwhile, heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions; sauté until tender and brown, about 6 minutes. Add bell pepper mixture; sauté 4 minutes. Add pasta to skillet and toss to coat. Transfer to large bowl. Add walnuts, parsley and 1 1/2 cups cheese; toss to coat. Serve, passing additional Parmesan cheese separately.
