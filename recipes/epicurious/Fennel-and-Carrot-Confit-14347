Shave carrots with a vegetable peeler into very thin, wide ribbons. Quarter fennel bulb lengthwise, then very thinly slice lengthwise. Heat oil with cayenne, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a 1-quart heavy saucepan over low heat until warm. Add carrots, fennel, and zest and cook gently, without simmering, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are just tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain oil into a bowl (see cooks' note, below) and transfer vegetables to another bowl to cool to room temperature.
