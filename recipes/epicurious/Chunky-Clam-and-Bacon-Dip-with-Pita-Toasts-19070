In a skillet cook bacon over moderate heat, stirring, until golden and crisp and transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. In a large sieve set over a bowl drain clams, reserving clam juice, and in another bowl whisk together cream cheese and sour cream. Whisk 2 tablespoons reserved clam juice into cream cheese mixture with clams, bacon, and remaining ingredients. Dip may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring dip to room temperature before serving. Serve dip with toasts or chips.
