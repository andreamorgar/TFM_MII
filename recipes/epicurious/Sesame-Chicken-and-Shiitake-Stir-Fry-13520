Heat a wok or 12-inch skillet over high heat until a bead of water dropped onto cooking surface evaporates immediately. Add 1 tablespoon oil, swirling wok to coat evenly, and heat until hot and just smoking. Add onion and stir-fry until golden and crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Transfer onion to a large bowl. Add 1/2 tablespoon oil to wok and heat until just smoking, then stir-fry half of chicken until just cooked through, about 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer to bowl with onion and stir-fry remaining chicken in 1/2 tablespoon oil in same manner, transferring to bowl. Add remaining tablespoon oil to wok and heat until just smoking, then stir-fry mushrooms until just tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Add peas and stir-fry until heated through, about 1 minute, then transfer to bowl. Add vinegar mixture and sesame seeds to wok and, when liquid just reaches a boil, add chicken mixture and stir-fry until heated through, about 1 minute.
