Heat lard in a large heavy skillet over medium heat until it shimmers, then cook chopped onion and garlic, stirring, until golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Add beans, broth, and 1/4 teaspoon salt (or to taste) and simmer, mashing beans, until beans resemble a coarse purée, about 5 minutes. Halve rolls horizontally and hollow out slightly, discarding excess bread. Generously spread refried beans on both sides of each roll, then make sandwiches with remaining ingredients and salt to taste.
