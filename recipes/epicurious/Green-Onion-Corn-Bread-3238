Preheat oven to 400°F. Lightly spray 13x9x2-inch metal baking pan with nonstick spray. Melt butter in medium skillet over medium heat. Add 1 cup sliced green onions and sauté until beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. Cool. Whisk 2 cups cornmeal, 1 cup flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 4 teaspoons baking powder and 1 teaspoon salt in medium bowl to blend. Add onion-butter mixture, buttermilk and eggs; stir until just combined. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake corn bread until edges are lightly browned and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool completely. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Wrap tightly in foil and store at room temperature.)
