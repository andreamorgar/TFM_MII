Heat oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and lemon peel and sauté 30 seconds. Add scallops and sauté until almost cooked through, turning once, about 3 minutes. Transfer scallops to bowl using slotted spoon. Add sun-dried tomatoes, capers, lemon juice and thyme to same skillet. Boil until liquid thickens, adding any accumulated juices from scallops to skillet, about 2 minutes. Add butter and whisk just until melted. Season to taste with salt. Return scallops to skillet and stir just until heated through. Transfer scallops and sauce to plates and serve.
