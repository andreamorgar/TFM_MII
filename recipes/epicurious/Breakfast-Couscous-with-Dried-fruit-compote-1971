Simmer water, sugar, and fruit in a small saucepan over medium heat, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until liquid just starts to become syrupy, about 8 minutes. Add tea bag and let steep off heat while making couscous. Cook couscous in butter in a heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring, until pale golden, about 2 minutes. Off heat, stir in water, cinnamon, and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Cover tightly. Let stand 5 minutes, then fluff.
