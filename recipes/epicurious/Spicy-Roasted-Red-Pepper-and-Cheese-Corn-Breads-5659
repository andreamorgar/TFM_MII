Into a bowl sift together the cornmeal, the flour, the baking powder, the baking soda, the salt, and the sugar. In a large bowl whisk together the eggs, the buttermilk, the butter, the chilies, and the corn, add the cornmeal mixture, and stir the batter until it is just combined. Stir in the roasted peppers, the Monterey Jack, and the coriander, divide the batter among 4 buttered and floured loaf pans, each 5 3/4 by 3 1/4 by 2-inches, and bake the breads in the middle of a preheated 375°F. oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Remove the breads from the pans and let them cool, right sides up, on a rack. The breads keep, wrapped well in plastic wrap and foil, chilled for 1 week or frozen for 1 month.
