Toss together mangoes, vinegar, brown sugar, raisins, and 1 teaspoon salt. Mince and mash ginger, jalapeño, and garlic to a paste with remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt using a large heavy knife, then stir in cumin, coriander, and turmeric. Heat oil in a 4-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté onion and bell pepper, stirring occasionally, until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic paste and cinnamon stick, then reduce heat to moderate and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Stir in mango mixture and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until mangoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Discard cinnamon stick and cool chutney, uncovered, about 45 minutes.
