Cut watermelon lengthwise into narrow wedges about 1 1/2 inches wide, then cut wedges crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick slices (they will be tall and pointed). Trim rind to enable slices to stand upright. Just before serving, stir together pepper and salt and sprinkle over slices. Stir together cheese and mint and sprinkle slices again.
