Preheat oven to 400°F. Spray baking sheet with vegetable oil spray. Place eggplant halves cut side down on prepared baking sheet. Bake until eggplant is brown and tender, about 30 minutes. Cool slightly. Using large spoon, scoop out eggplant pulp (discard skin). Coarsely chop eggplant; transfer to bowl. Combine onion and broth in medium nonstick skillet. Sauté over medium heat until onion is tender, about 10 minutes. Add garlic; stir 1 minute. Add tomatoes; simmer until flavors blend, about 8 minutes. Add eggplant and wine; simmer until mixture thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat. Cool. Mix in basil. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover; chill. Bring to room temperature before continuing.) Divide eggplant mixture among toasts. Sprinkle with olives and serve.
