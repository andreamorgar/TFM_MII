Bring all ingredients to a boil in an 8- to 10-quart pot and skim froth. Reduce heat and gently simmer, uncovered, skimming froth occasionally, 3 hours. Remove chicken, then pour stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl and discard solids. If using stock right away, skim off and discard any fat. If not, cool stock completely, uncovered, then chill, covered, and discard any solidified fat.
