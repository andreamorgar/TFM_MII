1. To make the marinade, with the machine running, drop the garlic and jalapeño through the feed tube of a food processor. Add the onion and cilantro, and pulse until the onion is finely chopped. Add the yogurt, lime zest and juice, chili powder, and salt, and process into a purée. (Or place all of the ingredients, but only 1 cup of the yogurt, in a blender and process until smooth. Transfer the marinade to a bowl and stir in the remaining yogurt.) 2. Divide the chicken pieces between two 1-gallon self-sealing plastic bags. Pour in the marinade and seal the bags. Refrigerate for at least 2 and up to 8 hours. 3. Position two racks in the top third and center of the oven and preheat to 400°F. Line two large baking sheets with aluminum foil and lightly oil the foil. (This makes for easy cleanup.) 4. Remove the chicken from the marinade. Arrange on the baking sheets. Bake for 20 minutes. Turn the chicken and switch the positions of the baking sheets from top to bottom. Continue baking until a drumstick shows no sign of pink when pierced at the bone, about 25 minutes more. Transfer to a serving dish. Serve the chicken hot.
