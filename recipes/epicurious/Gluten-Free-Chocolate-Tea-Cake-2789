Preheat oven to 325°F. Lightly coat a 8 1/2 x 4 1/2" loaf pan with nonstick spray. Pulse cocoa powder and 1 cup almonds in a food processor until very finely ground, about 1 minute. Microwave chocolate and 1/4 cup water in a microwave-safe bowl in 15-second intervals (or heat in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water), stirring occasionally, until melted. Whisk in oil and salt, then almond mixture and half of granulated sugar, then egg yolks. Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat egg whites and cream of tartar until frothy. With motor running, gradually add remaining granulated sugar; beat egg whites to firm peaks. Gently fold egg whites into chocolate mixture in 2 additions, folding just until incorporated each time. Scrape batter into prepared pan; top with chopped almonds and raw sugar. Bake cake until top is firm when gently pressed and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, 50–60 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan 15 minutes. Turn out onto rack and let cool completely. Cake can be baked 4 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.
