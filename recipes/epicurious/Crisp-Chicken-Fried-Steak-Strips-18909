Cut steak across the grain into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Stir together soy sauce, lemon juice, sesame oil, vinegar, pepper, cayenne, and garlic. Add flank steak and marinate 10 minutes. While steak marinates, whisk together mustard and mayonnaise in a small bowl and transfer to a small serving dish. Spread panko in a shallow pan. Dredge each strip of steak in panko, then dip in beaten egg, letting excess drip off, and dredge again in panko, shaking off excess. Arrange steak as breaded in 1 layer on a large plate. Heat 1/4 inch oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then fry 5 or 6 strips (they should sizzle), turning over once, until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes total. Drain on paper towels. Fry remaining strips in same manner, reheating oil between batches. Serve steak strips with mustard sauce for dipping.
