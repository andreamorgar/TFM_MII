Place the tomatoes in a portable container. Sprinkle with the salt, pepper, and basil and drizzle with the olive oil. Cut the avocado in half and scoop out the flesh. In another container, mash it with the mayonnaise and lemon juice. Seal the containers until serving time. Then spread each slice of bread with the avocado mayonnaise and make 2 sandwiches, dividing the bacon, lettuce, and tomatoes evenly between them.
