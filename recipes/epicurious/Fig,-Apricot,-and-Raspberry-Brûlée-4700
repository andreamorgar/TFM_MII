In a small bowl stir together zest, citrus juices, vanilla, and mint sugar. Butter six 1-cup shallow flameproof gratin dishes or bowls. Quarter figs. Halve and pit apricots. Divide figs, apricots, raspberries, and juice mixture among dishes or bowls. Just before serving, sprinkle sugar evenly over fruit and caramelize with blowtorch, moving flame evenly back and forth just over sugar (alternatively, broil fruit under a preheated broiler set 2 to 3 inches from heat) until most of sugar is melted and deep golden in places. Immediately serve brûlées with crème fraîche.
