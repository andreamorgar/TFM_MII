Preheat oven to 350°F. Cut cookie log crosswise into 3 equal pieces. Press 2 pieces of dough evenly into 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom (reserve remaining dough for another use). Bake tart crust 12 minutes. Using back of fork, press down bottom of crust if necessary. Bake until golden brown, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer to rack. Stir butter, sugar and corn syrup in heavy medium saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium and boil 1 minute. Mix in cream, then pecans. Boil until mixture thickens, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes. Spoon filling into warm crust. Bake tart until filling is bubbling and color deepens slightly, about 10 minutes. Transfer tart to rack and cool completely.
