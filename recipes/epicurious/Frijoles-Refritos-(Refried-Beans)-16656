In a heavy 10- to 12-inch skillet over moderate heat, heat the lard. Gradually add the cooked beans and broth as necessary and use a bean or potato masher to gently mash them, lowering the heat if necessary to prevent scorching. Using a spatula or a flat wooden spoon, continue stirring and scraping the sides of the skillet until the beans dry out slightly and have cooked down to a paste. The beans should be moist and shiny. Serve the beans on a platter and garnish with the Queso Fresco and tortilla chips.
