Let the beans soak overnight in cold water to cover by 2 inches. Drain the beans and in a saucepan combine them with 4 1/2 cups water, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the salt, the bay leaf, and the pepper. Bring the water to a boil and simmer the beans for 1 1/4 hours, or until they are tender. Drain the beans and in the food processor purée 1 cup of them with 2 tablespoons of the oil, reserving the remaining beans. In a saucepan cook the onions and the garlic in the remaining 3 tablespoons oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until the onion is softened. Add the wine and boil the mixture, stirring, until the liquid is almost evaporated. Add the tomato purée, the crushed tomatoes, the sugar, the oregano, the remaining 3/4 tablespoon salt, and the reserved beans and simmer the sauce, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour. (Do not let the sauce come to a boil.) The sauce may be made in advance and frozen for 3 months. In a bowl combine the ricotta, the egg, the coriander, and 1/2 cup of the Parmesan. In a kettle of boiling salted water cook the noodles for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they are al dente, drain them in a colander, and rinse them under cold water. In a lightly oiled baking dish, 13 by 9 inches, arrange 3 of the noodles and over them spread half the ricotta mixture and then one third of the tomato bean sauce. Arrange one third of the mozzarella over the sauce and sprinkle it with one third of the remaining Parmesan. Layer 3 of the remaining noodles over the Parmesan, spread the puréed bean mixture and half the remaining tomato bean sauce over the noodles, and top the sauce with half the remaining mozzarella and half the remaining Parmesan. Arrange the 3 remaining noodles over the cheese, spoon the remaining ricotta mixture and tomato bean sauce over them, and top the sauce with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan. Bake the lasagna in the middle of a preheated 375°F. oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until it is bubbling.
