Season lamb pieces with salt and pepper. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large pot or Dutch oven over high heat. Working in batches, add lamb to pot and sauté until brown, about 4 minutes per batch. Return all lamb and any collected juices to pot. Mix in garlic cloves and rosemary. Add white wine and boil until reduced by 2/3, scraping up browned bits, about 8 minutes. Add Italian-style tomatoes and bring to boil. Cover; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until lamb pieces are tender, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Add peas and simmer uncovered until cooked through, about 10 minutes. Serve with rice.
