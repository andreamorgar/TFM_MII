Divide the strawberries and 1 tablespoon of the Marsala between 2 goblets and let the strawberries macerate for 15 minutes. In a metal bowl whisk together the eggs and the sugar, set the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, and whisk the mixture until it begins to thicken. Whisk in the remaining 1 tablespoon Marsala, continue to whisk the mixture until it is thick and foamy and registers 160°F. on a candy thermometer, and spoon the zabaglione over the strawberries.
