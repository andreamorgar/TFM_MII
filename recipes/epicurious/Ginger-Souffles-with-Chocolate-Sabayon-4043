Butter four 1 1/4-cup soufflé dishes or custard cups. Sprinkle with sugar. Combine first 4 ingredients in heavy medium sauce pan. Bring to boil. Remove from heat. Cover and let steep 30 minutes. Strain milk mixture. Return to same saucepan. Preheat oven to 400°F. Whisk egg yolks, 1/3 cup sugar and flour in small bowl to blend. Bring milk mixture in saucepan to boil over medium heat. Whisk in yolk mixture. Continue to whisk until mixture simmers and thickens, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Stir in crystallized ginger, candied fruit and peel (mixture will be thick). Cool. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover; let stand at room temperature.) Beat egg whites in large bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add 1/3 cup sugar; beat until stiff but not dry. Whisk 1/3 of whites into yolk mixture to lighten. Fold in remaining whites in 2 more additions. Divide among soufflé dishes. Bake soufflés until puffed and golden, about 18 minutes. Serve immediately with Chocolate Sabayon.
