Remove outer leaves from brussels sprouts; set aside. Halve sprouts; set aside. Pulse bacon in a food processor until finely ground. Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-low. Cook bacon, stirring often, until browned around edges and fat is rendered, about 4 minutes. Add breadcrumbs and cook, stirring often, until brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer breadcrumb mixture to paper towels and let cool slightly. Toss in a medium bowl with chile, thyme, and lemon zest; set aside. Increase heat to medium-high and heat 2 Tbsp. oil in same skillet. Add reserved halved brussels sprouts; season with salt. Cook, tossing occasionally, until deeply browned all over, 5–8 minutes. Reduce heat to low, cover skillet, and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Uncover skillet, add reserved leaves and 1 Tbsp. lemon juice, and toss to combine. Cover skillet and cook, tossing occasionally, until leaves are bright green and just wilted, 4–5 minutes. Uncover; add remaining 1 Tbsp. lemon juice and season with salt. Transfer brussels sprouts to a platter, drizzle with more oil, and top with reserved breadcrumb mixture (reheat breadcrumb mixture if needed in a small skillet or in microwave). Breadcrumb mixture can be made 3 hours ahead; store uncovered at room temperature. Brussels sprouts (without leaves) can be cooked 2 hours ahead; store covered at room temperature. Reheat before adding leaves.
