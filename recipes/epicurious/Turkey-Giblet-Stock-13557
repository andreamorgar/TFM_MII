Coarsely chop celery and carrot and quarter onion. In a large deep saucepan bring broth and water to a boil with celery, carrot, onion, and neck and giblets, skimming froth. Add bay leaf and fresh herbs and cook, uncovered, at a bare simmer 2 hours, or until liquid is reduced to about 6 cups. Pour stock through a fine sieve into a bowl. Stock may be made 2 days ahead and cooled completely, uncovered, before being chilled or frozen in an airtight container.
