Preheat the oven to 325°F. In a bowl whisk together the flour, the beer, the scallions, the capers, and the salt. In a heavy kettle heat 1 1/2 inches of the oil to 375°F. on a deep-fat thermometer, working in batches dip the broccoli in the batter, and fry it in the oil for 3 minutes, or until golden, transferring it as it is fried to paper towels to drain. Dip the carrots in the batter and fry them for 2 minutes in the same manner.
