Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add garlic and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add half and half and broth and boil until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Add arugula and crushed red pepper flakes and simmer until arugula wilts, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes; cook until tomatoes soften, about 2 minutes. Add pasta and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese; toss until sauce coats pasta, about 2 minutes. Season mixture with salt and pepper. Transfer pasta to large bowl. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup cheese.
