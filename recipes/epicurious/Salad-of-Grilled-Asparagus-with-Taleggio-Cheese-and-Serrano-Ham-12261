Prepare barbecue (medium heat) and preheat oven to 425°F. Whisk vinegar, shallot and sugar in small bowl until sugar dissolves. Gradually whisk in oil. Season dressing with salt and pepper. Arrange asparagus on rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons dressing. Sprinkle asparagus with salt and pepper. Grill asparagus until crisp-tender, turning occasionally, about 6 minutes. Return asparagus to same sheet. Drizzle with additional 1/3 cup dressing; top with cheese. Bake until cheese melts, about 5 minutes. Place greens in large bowl. Add 1/4 cup dressing and toss to coat. Using spatula, divide asparagus among 6 plates. Arrange greens alongside. Drape ham over greens. Sprinkle pine nuts over salads. Serve with remaining dressing.
