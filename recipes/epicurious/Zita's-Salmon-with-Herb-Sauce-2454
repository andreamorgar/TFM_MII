Preheat oven to 400°F. and butter a large baking sheet. In a large skillet melt butter over moderate heat and stir in lime juice, zest, Old Bay seasoning, bread crumbs, and garlic. Sauté mixture over moderately high heat, stirring frequently, until bread crumbs are crisp and golden. Remove skillet from heat and stir in parsley and basil. Season salmon with salt and pepper and coat all sides evenly with breadcrumb mixture. Put salmon on baking sheet and bake in middle of oven 15 to 20 minutes, or until just cooked through. Make herb sauce while salmon is baking. Serve salmon with herb sauce.
