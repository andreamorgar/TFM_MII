Arrange chicken in 12x9x2-inch baking dish. Mince 5 garlic cloves; mix in 1 teaspoon salt. Rub garlic mixture into chicken. Mix lemon juice, 2 tablespoons oil, 2 tablespoons rosemary, lemon peel and sugar in small bowl. Pour over chicken. Season with pepper. Cover; chill up to 3 hours. Preheat oven to 350°F. Place cannellini in large skillet. Chop remaining 4 garlic cloves and mix into cannellini with 2 tablespoons oil and 1 tablespoon rosemary. Season with salt and pepper. Uncover chicken and bake until cooked through but still juicy, basting occasionally, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven. Preheat broiler. Broil chicken until just brown, about 4 minutes. Meanwhile, stir bean salad over medium heat until heated through, about 8 minutes. Spoon salad onto platter. Top with chicken and pan juices.
