Combine cumin, coriander, garlic, and 1 tablespoon oil. Pat pork chops dry and season with salt and pepper. Rub spice mixture on both sides of chops. Heat remaining tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook chops until just cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes on each side. Serve pork chops sprinkled with cilantro. Recipe may be doubled to serve 4.
