In a large bowl whisk together lemon juice, mustard, and salt and add oil in a stream, whisking. With a sharp knife cut off ends of celery root and cut off peel. Rinse and dry celery root and halve lengthwise. Cut celery root crosswise into 1/8-inch slices and cut slices into 1/8-inch strips. Add celery root to dressing and toss to coat. In a saucepan of boiling salted water boil haricots verts until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes, and drain. Refresh haricots verts under cold water and drain well. Add haricots verts to celery root mixture with salt and pepper to taste and toss well.
