In a kettle bring the water to a boil, sprinkle in the rice and salt to taste, stirring until the water returns to a boil, and boil the rice for 10 minutes. Drain the rice in a large colander and rinse it. Set the colander over a large saucepan of boiling water and steam the rice, covered with a kitchen towel and the lid, for 15 minutes, or until it is fluffy and dry. The rice may be made 2 days in advance and kept chilled in an airtight container. Reheat the rice in the colander set over a saucepan of boiling water. Transfer the rice to a large bowl, sprinkle it with the paprika, and toss the mixture to coat the rice thoroughly.
