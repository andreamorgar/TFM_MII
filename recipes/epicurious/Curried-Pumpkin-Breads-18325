Into a bowl sift together the flour, the cornmeal, the baking powder, the baking soda, and the sugar. In a skillet cook the onion with the curry powder, the ground cumin, the cayenne, and the salt in 2 tablespoons of the butter over moderately low heat, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until it is soft, let the mixture cool, and stir in the cuminseed. In a large bowl whisk together the pumpkin purée, the eggs, the buttermilk, the onion mixture, and the remaining 4 tablespoons butter, melted, add the flour mixture, and stir the batter until it is just combined. Divide the batter among 4 buttered and floured loaf pans, each 5 3/4 by 3 1/4 by 2 inches, and bake the breads in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Remove the breads from the pans and let them cool, right sides up, on a rack. The breads keep, wrapped well in plastic wrap and foil, chilled for 1 week or frozen for 1 month.
