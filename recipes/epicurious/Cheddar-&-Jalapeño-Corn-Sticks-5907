Preheat oven to 425°F. Heat pans in middle of oven 10 minutes. Whisk together cornmeal, sugar, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together buttermilk and egg in another bowl and add cornmeal mixture with Cheddar, scallion, jalapeños, and 2 tablespoons butter, stirring, until just combined. Remove pans from oven and divide remaining 2 tablespoons butter among corn stick molds. Quickly divide batter among molds (about 3 tablespoons each) and bake until a tester comes out clean and tops are golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool corn sticks in pans 3 to 5 minutes before removing from molds. Serve warm.
