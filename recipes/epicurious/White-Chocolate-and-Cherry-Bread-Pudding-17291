Measure out 1/4 cup of mixture into small bowl and set aside. In third large mixing bowl, whisk together eggs, cream, milk, and vanilla. Whisk egg mixture into larger bowl of sugar mixture, then pour over bread-chocolate mixture and stir to combine. Pour batter into 9- by 13- by 2-inch baking pan and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup sugar mixture. Scatter butter cubes over top and bake until golden brown and just set in middle, 50 to 60 minutes.
