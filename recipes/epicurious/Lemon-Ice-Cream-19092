Have ready an ice-cream maker. In a saucepan whisk together zest, lemon juice, and sugar. Cook mixture over moderate heat, stirring, until sugar is dissolved, about 10 minutes, and cool to room temperature. In a bowl whisk together cream, milk, and salt and stir in lemon syrup. Transfer mixture to ice-cream maker and freeze. Transfer ice-cream to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden. Ice cream may be made 3 days ahead
