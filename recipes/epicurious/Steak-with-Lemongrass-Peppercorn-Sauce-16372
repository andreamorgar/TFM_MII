Finely chop 1/3 cup lemongrass. Heat a dry 12-inch heavy skillet (not nonstick) over medium heat 5 minutes. Pat steak dry and season with 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, undisturbed, 7 minutes. Turn, then cook 7 to 8 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board. Discard fat from skillet and deglaze with vermouth by boiling, scraping up bits, 1 minute. Add lemongrass, remaining ingredients, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and boil until thickened slightly, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve over steak.
