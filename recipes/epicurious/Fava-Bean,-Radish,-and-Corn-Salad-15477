Cook the fava beans in a pot of simmering salted water for 2 to 3 minutes or until cooked al dente. Drain in a colander and shock immediately in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Drain and place in a medium mixing bowl. Place 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a preheated sauté pan. Add the shallots and cook over medium heat for 1 minute or until the shallots are translucent. Add the corn to the pan and cook for 3 minutes or until the corn is just cooked. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature. Add the corn, radishes, chives, basil, lemon juice, and remaining olive oil to the bowl with the fava beans. Mix until thoroughly combined, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Equally divide the salad between four bowls and enjoy. The salad can be served at room temperature or chilled.
