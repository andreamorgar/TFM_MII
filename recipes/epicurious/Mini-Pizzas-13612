Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly oil 24 muffin cups. Using 2 1/2- to 2 3/4 inch-diameter cookie cutter, cut out center of each bread slice (reserve trimmings for another use). Press bread rounds onto bottoms and about 1/2 inch up sides of prepared cups, forming crusts. Sautamp;é sausage and garlic in heavy large skillet over medium heat until brown, breaking up with spoon, about 15 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer mixture to bowl; mix in mozzarella, 1/2 cup pizza sauce and Parmesan. Divide filling among crusts. Top each with 1/2 teaspoon of remaining sauce. Bake pizzas until crusts are light brown and filling is heated through, about 20 minutes. Serve hot.
