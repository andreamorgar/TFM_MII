Bring water to a boil with chicken wings in a 5- to 6-quart tall narrow stockpot and skim froth. Add remaining ingredients. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, skimming froth occasionally, 3 hours. Pour stock though a fine sieve set over a bowl and discard solids. Cool, uncovered, then chill, covered, until fat has solidified, at least overnight and up to 3 days. Scrape off all fat.
