In a heavy 3-quart saucepan spread 2/3 cup of the sugar, add the cinnamon stick, and top the sugar with half the papaya strips. Sprinkle 2/3 cup of the remaining sugar on top, add the remaining papaya strips, and top the strips with the remaining 2/3 cup sugar. Cook the mixture, covered, over moderately low heat, shaking the pan occasionally (do not stir), for 35 to 45 minutes, or until the sugar is dissolved completely. Simmer the papaya strips, uncovered, for 10 minutes, or until they begin to appear translucent. Let the mixture cool and chill it, covered, overnight. The papaya in cinnamon syrup keeps, covered and chilled, for 1 month.
