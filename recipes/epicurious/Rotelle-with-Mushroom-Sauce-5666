In a heavy skillet cook the onion in the butter over moderate heat, stirring, until it is softened, add the mushrooms, and cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes, or until the liquid the mushrooms give off is evaporated and the mushrooms are browned lightly. Stir in the anchovies, the Worcestershire sauce, the cream, and the lemon juice, cook the mixture for 2 minutes, and season it with salt and pepper. While the mushrooms are cooking, in a kettle of boiling salted water boil the rotelle until it is al dente, reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water, and drain the rotelle well. Transfer the rotelle to a large bowl, add the mushroom mixture and the parsley, and toss the mixture well, adding enough of the reserved cooking water to thin the sauce to the desired consistency.
