In a large bowl whisk together lime juice, oil, and garlic and season generously with salt and pepper. Add chicken, turning to coat. Marinate chicken, covered and chilled, turning once or twice, at least 2 hours and up to 1 day. Preheat oven to 400°F. Remove chicken from marinade, discarding marinade, and arrange, skin sides up, without crowding, in a shallow baking pan. Season chicken with salt and pepper and roast in upper third of oven until just cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Change oven setting to broil and broil chicken about 2 inches from heat until skin is crisp, about 2 minutes.
