Preheat oven to 450°F with rack in middle. Put fish in a 4-sided sheet pan, then drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil and season with a slightly rounded 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper (total). Roast until just cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. While fish cooks, heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then cook scallions, zucchini, artichokes, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, stirring occasionally, 4 minutes. Stir in peas, romaine, and water and cook, covered, until zucchini is tender, about 3 minutes more. Stir in mint. Serve fish over vegetables and drizzle with oil.
