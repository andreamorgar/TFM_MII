Melt butter in heavy small saucepan over medium heat. Add shallots and garlic; sauté until soft and translucent, about 1 minute. Add wine; simmer until mixture is reduced to 2 tablespoons, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat and cool. Whisk remaining ingredients into shallot mixture. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.)
