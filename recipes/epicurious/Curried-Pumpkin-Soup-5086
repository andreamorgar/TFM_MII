Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions, leeks, carrot, and apple and sauté over medium-low heat until the onions are translucent, about 15 minutes. Add the curry, spice sachet, and the remaining vegetables. Pour in the water and bring to a gentle simmer, for about 45 minutes, until the vegetables are very soft. Remove the spice sachet and puree the vegetable mixture in a food mill. To give the soup a silky-smooth texture, pass through a fine-mesh strainer. Transfer the soup to a saucepan. Add the cream and taste and adjust the seasoning. Heat gently just until warmed through. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with the chives. TO DRINK: Riesling, Pikes Clare Valley
