Chop garlic cloves with salt and pepper on cutting board, then use flat side of knife blade to mash garlic mixture to paste. Scrape paste into small bowl; mix in olive oil. Rub garlic paste on both sides of lamb chops. Let lamb chops stand 10 minutes. Meanwhile, stir 3 tablespoons mint jelly, 3 tablespoons white wine vinegar and rosemary in small saucepan over high heat until mint jelly melts and mixture boils. Reduce heat to medium and cook until sauce thickens to syrup, about 2 minutes. Preheat broiler. Broil lamb chops until well browned but still pink inside, about 4 minutes per side. Arrange lamb chops on 2 plates. Spoon sauce over.
