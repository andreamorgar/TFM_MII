Dissolve yeast and honey in 1/2 cup warm water (110°F-115°F) in a small bowl. Let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Combine 4 1/2 cups flour, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add the yeast mixture, 6 tablespoons oil, potatoes, and 1 cup warm water. Mix with a wooden spoon until almost incorporated, then finish mixing with your hands. Transfer dough to a floured work surface and knead until smooth, 4-6 minutes, adding more flour by tablespoonfuls if dough seems very sticky (dough should be soft and elastic). Brush a large bowl with oil; place dough in bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm, draft-free area. Let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add bacon and cook until it is light golden but not crisp. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Preheat oven to 425°F. Brush a 17x11x1" baking sheet with oil. Press dough into pan. Press with your fingertips all over, forming dimples. Drizzle remaining 2 tablespoons oil over. Bake focaccia for 10 minutes. Sprinkle cheese over, then bacon and rosemary. Return to oven and bake until golden brown, 12-15 minutes longer. Let cool for 10 minutes in pan. Slide bread onto a wire rack to cool completely. Slice into 2x1" pieces.
