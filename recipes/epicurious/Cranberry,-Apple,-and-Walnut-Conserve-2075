Simmer water, sugar, cinnamon stick, allspice, and half of cranberries (about 5 1/2 cups) in a 4- to 5-quart heavy pot over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until cranberries just start to pop, about 5 minutes. Add half of remaining cranberries (about 3 cups) and simmer, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Meanwhile, peel and core apples, then cut into 1/4-inch dice. Add to cranberry mixture along with walnuts and remaining cranberries, then simmer, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Stir in Calvados and simmer 1 minute. Remove from heat and cool to warm or room temperature. Discard cinnamon stick.
