Preheat broiler. Pat fish dry and place in a shallow baking pan, then brush fish with olive oil and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Broil fish 3 to 4 inches from heat, without turning, until opaque and just cooked through, about 4 minutes (depending on thickness of fillet). While fish cooks, make sauce by stirring together mayonnaise, yogurt, chipotle powder, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Toss together coleslaw mix with 1/2 cup sauce in a large bowl. Wrap stack of tortillas in dampened paper towels and microwave on high power until warm and pliable, 1 to 3 minutes. Discard paper towels and wrap tortillas in a cloth napkin to keep warm. Transfer fish to a platter along with bowls of coleslaw, remaining sauce, salsa, lime wedges, and a basket of warm tortillas. Serve immediately.
