Peel, seed, and cut chiles lengthwise into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Set aside. Brush steaks with 1 tablespoon oil. Mix 1 teaspoon cumin and ancho chile powder; rub spice mixture on both sides of steaks. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add zucchini, poblanos, and green onions; sauté until zucchini is tender, about 2 minutes. Stir in 1 teaspoon cumin. Add cream; boil until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in another large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add both steaks to skillet and cook to desired doneness (about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare). Remove steaks from pan. Let cool 5 minutes. Thinly slice steaks across grain. Transfer steaks to platter. Top with poblanos and cilantro. Using tongs, char the chile over a gas flame, or place it in the broiler, and turn it occasionally. When chile is blackened all over, enclose it in a paper bag for 10 to 15 minutes to allow the chile to steam, which loosens the skin. Using your fingers or the back of a knife, remove the blackened skin from the chile.
