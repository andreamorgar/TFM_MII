Whisk oil and juice in a medium bowl. Season dressing with salt and pepper. Working with 1 artichoke at a time, break off outer leaves until only pale-green ones remain. Cut 1/2" off the top; trim dark green parts around stem and heart. Slice lengthwise very thinly and toss in dressing. Repeat with remaining artichokes. Mix in celery and remaining ingredients. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a platter and top with cheese.
