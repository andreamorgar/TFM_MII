Preheat oven to 250°F. Lightly oil a large sheet of foil on a baking sheet, then warm in oven. Shake nuts in a coarse sieve to remove any nut powder (this will create a clearer brittle). Cook sugar and water in a deep 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderately low heat, stirring slowly with a fork, until melted and pale golden. Cook caramel without stirring, swirling pan, until golden. Immediately stir in red pepper flakes and nuts and cook, stirring, until nuts are golden, about 1 minute. Quickly pour onto foil, tilting baking sheet to spread brittle evenly before it hardens. (If caramel hardens too fast, put in a 400°F oven until warm enough to spread, 1 to 2 minutes.) Cool brittle on baking sheet on a rack until completely hardened, then break into large pieces.
