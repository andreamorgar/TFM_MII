In a large saucepan combine the cider, the vinegar, the onions, the raisins, the brown sugar, the cloves, and salt and pepper to taste and boil the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the liquid is reduced to a syrupy consistency. The chutney keeps, covered and chilled, for 1 week. Serve the chutney with roasted meats or poultry.
