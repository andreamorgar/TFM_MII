Boil the potatoes in a large pot of salted water until tender, then drain. Once they are cool enough to handle, peel them. Rinse the fish in cold water, then coat each one in the flour, patting off the excess. Melt 5 tablespoons of the butter in a skillet and pan-fry the fish for 5 minutes on each side, or until crisp and golden. Keep the cooked fish warm while you cook the remainder. Melt the remaining butter in a casserole. Add the peeled potatoes and let them sauté a little before adding the parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately with the potatoes, sliced lemon, and dill sprigs.
