Heat corn oil in medium skillet over medium-high heat. Slice reserved apple peel lengthwise into very thin strips. Fry peel in oil until golden and crisp, about 30 seconds. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Sprinkle peel with salt. Warm soup over medium heat, stirring occasionally (do not boil). Season with salt. Divide soup among 6 bowls. Garnish with fried apple peel.
