Halve 1 pound tomatoes, then purée with cherry pepper (if using), red pepper flakes, oil, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender until smooth. Finely chop remaining tomatoes and combine with celery and tomato purée in a large bowl. Toss hot capellini with tomato sauce and mozzarella. Serve sprinkled with celery leaves.
