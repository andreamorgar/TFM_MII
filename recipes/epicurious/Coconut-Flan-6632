Preheat oven to 350°F. Arrange six 3/4-cup custard cups in 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking pan. Whisk first 5 ingredients in medium bowl to blend. Mix in coconut. Divide mixture among cups. Pour enough hot water into pan to come halfway up sides of cups. Bake flans until just set in center, about 30 minutes. Remove flans from pan and refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.)
