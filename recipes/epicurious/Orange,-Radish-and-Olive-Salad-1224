Cut peel and white pith from 4 oranges with a sharp knife. Halve oranges lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Squeeze enough juice from remaining orange to measure 3 tablespoons. Whisk together orange and lemon juices, oil, honey, cinnamon, and cayenne until emulsified. Season with salt and pepper. Add orange slices, radishes, and olives and gently toss. Let stand at room temperature 15 minutes before serving.
