Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, bell pepper and garlic and sauté until just soft, about 8 minutes. Add rice and chili powder and stir until well blended, about 1 minute. Mix in tomato sauce and heat through. Mix in 1/4 cup cilantro and broth. Bring mixture to boil. Cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 25 minutes. Transfer rice to bowl. Garnish with remaining 1/4 cup cilantro and serve.
