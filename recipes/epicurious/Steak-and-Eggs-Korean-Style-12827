Korean hot pepper paste (gochu jang or kochujang) is made with pureed fermented soybeans (miso) and hot chiles. Kimchi is a spicy and pungent fermented vegetable mixture; this recipe calls for the version made with Napa cabbage. Both can be found at Korean markets and online at koamart.com. Whisk first 10 ingredients in bowl. Add steaks. Cover; chill overnight. Bring 2 cups water to boil in small saucepan. Add rice and 1 teaspoon salt. Return to boil; reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until water is absorbed, about 18 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Grill steaks until slightly charred but still pink in center, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to plate. Let stand 5 minutes. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add kimchi and vinegar. Stir until heated. Fold in rice. Season with salt and pepper. Keep warm. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Crack eggs into skillet, being careful not to break yolk. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook until whites are set, about 3 minutes. Divide kimchi rice among 4 plates. Slice steaks thinly across grain; arrange over rice. Top each with egg; sprinkle with green onions and serve. *Available in the Asian foods section of some supermarkets and at Japanese markets.
