Whisk 2 tablespoons mint, soy sauce, 1 chile, half of ginger, fish sauce, lime juice, 1 teaspoon garlic, sugar, and 2 tablespoons water in a medium bowl. Set dressing aside. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Working in 2 batches and adding 2 tablespoons oil between batches, cook eggplant until golden brown, 2-3 minutes per side. Transfer eggplant slices to a medium bowl. Pour half of dressing over eggplant and toss to coat evenly. Set remaining dressing aside. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in same skillet over medium-high heat. Add remaining chile, ginger, 1 teaspoon garlic, and beef and cook, turning beef once, until nicely seared and medium-rare, about 3 minutes total. Add eggplant mixture (with liquid) to skillet and toss to mix well. Divide noodles or rice among bowls. Spoon stir-fry over. Drizzle reserved dressing over stir-fry and garnish with remaining 2 tablespoons chopped mint.
