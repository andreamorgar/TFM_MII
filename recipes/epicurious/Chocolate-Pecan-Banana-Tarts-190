Preheat oven to 425°F. On a lightly floured surface with a floured rolling pin roll out pastry into a 10- by 5-inch rectangle and cut in half to form two squares. On a baking sheet arrange squares about 2 inches apart. Cut banana diagonally into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Sprinkle pastry squares evenly with chocolate, leaving a 1/2-inch border on all sides, and arrange banana slices decoratively over chocolate. Top banana slices with pecans, sugar, and butter and chill 10 minutes, or until pastry is firm. Bake tarts in middle of oven 10 to 15 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and cooked through, and cool slightly on a rack.
