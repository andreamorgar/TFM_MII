Combine 1/2 cup flour and sesame seeds in small bowl. Lightly dust scallops with remaining 1/4 cup flour. Dip each scallop into beaten eggs, then dredge in sesame seed-flour mixture; shake off excess. Heat 2 tablespoons canola oil and 1 tablespoon sesame oil in each of 2 heavy large skillets over medium-high heat. Add 8 scallops to each skillet and sauté until golden brown and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer scallops to paper towels and drain. Toss greens and red peppers with enough Ginger Vinaigrette to coat. Mound salad in center of 4 plates. Arrange 4 scallops around each salad and serve.
