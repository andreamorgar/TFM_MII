Preheat oven to 450°F. Sprinkle brisket with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large pot over medium-high heat. Brown brisket, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to large roasting pan. Add chopped onions, chopped carrot, celery and garlic to pot; sauté until golden, about 10 minutes. Add wine, thyme sprigs and bay leaves; boil until liquid is reduced to 5 cups, about 10 minutes. Add stock to pot; bring to boil. Pour wine mixture over brisket to fill 2/3 of pan; reserve remaining wine mixture. Roast brisket uncovered until very tender, turning and basting occasionally and adding more wine mixture as necessary to keep pan 2/3 full, about 3 1/2 hours. Transfer meat to platter. Strain pan juices into 4-cup measuring cup, pressing on solids; add enough wine mixture to measure 3 1/2 cups. Season with salt and pepper. Thinly slice meat across grain. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover meat and sauce separately; chill. Arrange meat in baking dish. Cover with foil; rewarm in 350°F oven about 40 minutes. Rewarm sauce.) Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add baby carrots, pearl onions and 1 tablespoon thyme; sauté until golden, about 5 minutes. Cover and cook until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve meat with sauce and vegetables.
