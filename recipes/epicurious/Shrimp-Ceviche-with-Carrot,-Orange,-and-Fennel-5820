Pour through a fine-mesh sieve into another small bowl (discard solids). Combine sauce ingredients in a 4- to 6-quart pot and boil, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 2 cups, 30 to 40 minutes. Pour through a medium-mesh sieve into a bowl (discard solids), then set bowl in a larger bowl of ice and cold water to chill sauce. Cook shrimp in cleaned 4- to 6-quart pot of boiling salted water until just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain and transfer to another bowl of ice and cold water to cool. Drain and halve lengthwise, then chill, covered. Heat 4 tablespoons lemon oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté carrots, stirring, until just tender, about 3 minutes. Spread carrots with oil from skillet on a plate and chill. Grate zest from oranges into a large bowl. Cut remaining rind and white pith from oranges with a sharp paring knife and discard. Cut orange segments free from membranes and add to zest. Slice fennel and onion very thinly crosswise with slicer. Stir carrots into orange mixture along with fennel, onion, lime juice, remaining lemon oil, chives, mint, and salt. Mound salad on 8 plates and top with shrimp. Drizzle about 3 tablespoons carrot sauce around each mound.
