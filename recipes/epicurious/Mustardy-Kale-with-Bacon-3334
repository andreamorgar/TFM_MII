Cook kale in a large pot of boiling salted water (1 tablespoon salt for 6 quarts water) until just tender, 10 to 13 minutes, then drain. Cook bacon in a 4-quart heavy saucepan over medium heat until crisp. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a paper towel to drain. Discard all but 2 tablespoons fat from pan, then cook scallions until soft, about 3 minutes. Stir in kale and mustard and cook over medium-low heat, covered, stirring occasionally, until very tender, about 10 minutes. Serve topped with bacon.
