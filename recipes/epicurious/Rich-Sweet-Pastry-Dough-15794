In a bowl with a pastry blender or in a food processor blend or pulse together flour, sugar, and salt. Add butter and blend or pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add yolks and, if blending by hand, stir until mixture forms a dough. If using a food processor pulse until mixture forms large clumps and with hands form mixture into a dough. On a work surface smear dough in 3 or 4 forward motions with heel of hand to slightly develop gluten in flour and make dough easier to work with. Form dough into a ball and flatten to form a disk. Chill dough, wrapped in plastic wrap, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.
