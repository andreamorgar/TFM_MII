Cover beans with water by 2 inches in a 4-quart heavy pot and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and let stand, uncovered, 1 hour. Preheat oven to 300°F. Drain beans and put in a 3-quart wide shallow pot or flameproof baking dish along with remaining ingredients, stirring to combine. Bring to a boil on top of stove, then cover tightly and bake in middle of oven until beans are just tender, about 2 hours. Uncover and bake until most of liquid is absorbed and top is slightly crusty, 1 to 1 1/2 hours more.
