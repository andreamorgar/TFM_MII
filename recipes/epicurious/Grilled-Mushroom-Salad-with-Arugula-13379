Whisk together vinegar, sugar, salt, pepper, and shallots in a large bowl. Add oil in a slow stream, whisking constantly until combined. Reserve half of vinaigrette in another large bowl and add mushrooms to remaining vinaigrette. Toss to coat and marinate 5 minutes. Transfer mushrooms to another bowl with a slotted spoon, discarding marinade. Heat lightly oiled grill pan over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then grill mushrooms in 3 batches, turning frequently, until golden brown, about 5 minutes per batch. Transfer as grilled to a cutting board and cool to room temperature. Cut portabellas into 1/2-inch-wide wedges, then halve shiitake and cremini mushrooms and cut chanterelles (if large) lengthwise into 1/2-inch pieces. Transfer mushrooms to reserved vinaigrette, tossing to coat, then add arugula, cheese, and salt and pepper to taste and toss again.
