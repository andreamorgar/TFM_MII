Using a mandoline cut carrots and zucchini into 1/8-inch-thick julienne strips. (Alternatively, using a sharp knife, halve carrots and zucchini crosswise and cut lengthwise into 1/8-inch-wide pieces.) In a 6-quart kettle bring 5 quarts salted water to a boil. Add linguine and cook 8 minutes, or until barely tender. Add carrots and cook 1 minute. Add zucchini and cook 1 minute. Reserve 2/3 cup cooking water and drain pasta and vegetables. In a large bowl stir together pesto and reserved hot cooking water. Add pasta and vegetables and toss well. In a food processor blend together all ingredients with salt and pepper to taste until smooth. Pesto keeps, surface covered with plastic wrap, chilled, 1 week. Makes about 3/4 cup.
