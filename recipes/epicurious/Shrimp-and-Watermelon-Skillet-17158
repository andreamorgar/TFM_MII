Heat oven to 450°F. On a baking sheet, toast pita triangles, turning once, until crisp and brown, 3 to 5 minutes each side. In a large skillet, heat oil over high heat. Cook shrimp and shallots, stirring, until shrimp is pink and shallots are crisp, 2 to 4 minutes; transfer to a bowl. In same skillet, cook watermelon and 1/4 cup water over high heat, stirring, until liquid becomes syrupy, about 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat; add shrimp mixture, salt and pepper; stir. Divide shrimp-watermelon mixture (warm or chilled) among 4 plates; add cucumber and feta. Sprinkle with dill and mint. Serve with 4 pita pieces each and lime wedges.
