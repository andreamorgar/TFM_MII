In a large saucepan, heat oil over medium-low. Add onion, fennel, and garlic; cover and cook about 10 minutes. In a large metal spoon or small pan, heat saffron over low heat until dry, about 10 seconds. Grind to a powder with the back of a spoon and steep in 1 tbsp boiling water to release flavor, about 1 minute. Add wine and spoonful of saffron to pan, then stir in shredded basil. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; reduce heat to low and simmer 1 to 2 minutes. Add tomatoes, their juice, and 1 cup water. Return to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to low and simmer, partially covered, about 30 minutes. Garnish with fennel fronds and chopped basil.
