Blend flour and salt in processor. Add shortening and butter and cut in using several on/off turns. Add cheese and cut in until shortening and butter resemble small peas. With machine running, gradually blend in enough water until soft moist clumps form. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic and chill at least 2 hours and up to 2 days. Mix apples, raisins, brown sugar, 1/3 cup sugar, flour, lemon juice and spices in large bowl. Let stand 30 minutes at room temperature. Preheat oven to 400°F. Remove dough from refrigerator and let stand 15 minutes. Spoon fruit and any accumulated juices into 13x9-inch oval baking dish. Dot fruit with 3 tablespoons butter. Roll out dough on floured surface to oval about 1/2 inch larger than baking dish. Fold in 1/2 inch of edge to form double-thick border; crimp. Cut out 1-inch-wide hole from center of crust. Using tart pan bottom as aid, lift dough and place atop fruit. Tuck in dough around edges. Bake pie 15 minutes. Brush crust with egg glaze. Top with 2 teaspoons sugar.
