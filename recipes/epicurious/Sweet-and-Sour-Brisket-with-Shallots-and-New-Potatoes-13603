Preheat oven to 300°F. Puree first 4 ingredients in blender until smooth. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in large wide ovenproof pot over medium-high heat. Add onions and whole shallots. Sauté until onions are deep golden and shallots begin to brown, about 20 minutes. Transfer shallots to small bowl; reserve. Add chicken broth to onions; bring to boil, scraping up browned bits. Pour onion mixture into large bowl. Add 2 tablespoons oil to same pot. Sprinkle brisket on all sides with salt and pepper. Add to pot and brown well, about 5 minutes per side. Turn brisket fat side up. Return onion mixture to pot. Add tomato puree and orange juice mixture. Bring to boil, stirring to blend sauce. Cover pot; bake brisket 2 hours. Add shallots and potatoes. Cover; bake 1 hour. Uncover; bake until brisket is tender, occasionally spooning sauce over, about 1 hour longer. Let rest 30 minutes. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled.) Scrape sauce off brisket. Transfer brisket to work surface; slice thinly across grain, trimming any fat, if desired. Overlap hot slices on platter or cold slices in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Surround with shallots and potatoes. Rewarm sauce. Spoon some sauce over. Rewarm brisket, if necessary, in 350°F oven until heated through. Serve, passing remaining sauce separately.
