Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, about 2 minutes for fresh and 10 minutes for dried. Drain pasta. Return to same pot and toss with oil. Combine sauce and wine in heavy medium saucepan. Bring to simmer over medium heat. Mix in tuna and olives, being careful to keep tuna in fairly large pieces. Season with salt and pepper. Divide pasta between 2 plates. Using large spoon, make indentation in centers of pasta to create "nests." Spoon sauce into centers. Sprinkle each with basil.
