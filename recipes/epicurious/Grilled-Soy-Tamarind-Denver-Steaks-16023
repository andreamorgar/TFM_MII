In a large re-sealable plastic bag, combine the soy with the tamarind, honey, ginger, garlic, chile sauce and sesame oil. Season with salt and pepper and gently shake to combine. Add the steaks and seal, pressing out any air. Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour or refrigerate for four hours or up to overnight. Light a grill and oil the grates. Drain the meat, reserving the marinade and add to the grill. Cook uncovered over high heat, turning and brushing with the marinade until brown and crusty in spots and nicely glazed, about 20 minutes or until an instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 140°. Transfer to a cutting board, let sit for 5 minutes then thinly slice across the grain.
