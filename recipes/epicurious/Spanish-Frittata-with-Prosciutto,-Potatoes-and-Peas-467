Preheat oven to 375°F. Heat vegetable oil in large ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add potatoes; cover and cook until tender, stirring occasionally, about 18 minutes. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.) Remove potatoes from skillet. Scrape out and discard any browned bits from pan. Whisk eggs, salt and pepper in large bowl to blend. Pour eggs into same skillet. Arrange half of potatoes over eggs. Sprinkle half of prosciutto and half of peas over potatoes. Repeat with remaining potatoes, prosciutto and peas. Bake until puffed and set, about 15 minutes. Loosen edges and bottom of frittata with flexible spatula; slide out onto plate. Drizzle with truffle oil. Sprinkle with chives and serve.
