Cook asparagus in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer asparagus to small bowl. Cool. Add pasta to same pot and cook until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain well. Transfer pasta to very large bowl. Toss with 1 tablespoon oil. Cool. Blend cup oil, green onions, vinegar and soy sauce in blender until smooth, about 2 minutes. (Asparagus, pasta and dressing can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover separately; chill.) Pour dressing over pasta. Add asparagus, spinach and cashews; toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper.
