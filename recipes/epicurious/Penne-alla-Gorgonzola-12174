Cook pasta in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water , stirring occasionally, until al dente, 10 to 12 minutes. While pasta boils, heat butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until foam subsides, then cook sage, stirring, 1 minute. Add milk and Gorgonzola and cook, stirring and breaking up cheese, until sauce is smooth, about 2 minutes (sauce will be thin). Reduce heat to low and stir in pepper, nutmeg, and salt to taste. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking water and drain pasta. Add pasta and parmesan to sauce, stirring to coat. Thin with a little reserved cooking water if necessary.
