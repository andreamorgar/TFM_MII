Sprinkle chicken with 2 teaspoons coarsely ground pepper and 1 teaspoon salt. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then brown chicken, skin side down first, turning once, 8 to 10 minutes total. Transfer to a plate, discarding oil. Wipe out skillet, then boil remaining ingredients until reduced by half, 3 to 5 minutes. Return chicken to skillet and braise, covered, turning once, until chicken is just cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer chicken to a platter. Boil sauce to thicken if necessary. Whisk sauce if separated and season with salt, then pour over chicken.
