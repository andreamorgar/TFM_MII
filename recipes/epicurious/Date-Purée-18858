Bring all ingredients to a simmer, covered directly with a round of parchment paper, in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, then reduce heat and simmer until dates are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove and discard spices. Transfer dates with a slotted spoon to a food processor. If cooking liquid measures more than about 1 cup, boil to reduce. Add to dates and purée until smooth. Force purée, a few tablespoons at a time, through a fine-mesh sieve with back of a wooden spoon into a small saucepan, discarding skins. Reheat over low heat, stirring occasionally, before serving.
