In a bowl combine the lamb, the parsley, the coriander, the mint, the onion, the cinnamon, the cumin, and salt and pepper to taste, knead the mixture with your hands until it is combined well, and chill it, covered, for 15 minutes. Form the mixture into eight 3-inch oval patties, about 1-1/2 inches thick, with moistened hands, and on the lightly oiled rack of a broiler pan broil the patties under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for about 4 to 5 minutes on each side, or until the lamb is just cooked through. Make the sauce while the lamb is broiling: In a bowl whisk together the yogurt, the mint, and salt and pepper to taste. Divide the patties between 2 plates lined with romaine and serve them with the yogurt sauce and the pita loaves.
