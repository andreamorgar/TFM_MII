1. Heat the boiler. Heat the olive oil in a large, ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until clear and translucent, about 1 minute. In a bowl whisk together the eggs, ham, 1/3 cup of the cheese, thyme, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. 2. Add egg mixture to onions and cook, without stirring, about 8 minutes, or until the bottom and edges are set but center is still soft. 3. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on the top of the frittata. Broil about 4 inches from the heat until the cheese is bubbling, about 1 minute. Transfer to a cutting board, cut into wedges, and serve.
