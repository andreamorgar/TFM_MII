Preheat oven to 350°F. Trim meat and excess fat from 1/2 pound chicken skin (from about 2 whole chickens or 3 pounds thighs); cut into 3" pieces. Flatten, flesh side down, on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper; top with another sheet of parchment and baking sheet (to keep skin from curling). Bake until browned and crisp, about 1 hour. Remove top baking sheet and paper; let cool 10 minutes. Skin can be baked 3 hours ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.
