Trim any fat and membrane from pork and transfer pork to a large heavy-duty sealable plastic bag. In a bowl whisk together all remaining ingredients except honey and add to pork. Seal bag, pressing out excess air, and turn it to coat pork well. Chill pork, turning bag once or twice, at least 2 hours and up to 12. Prepare grill. Remove pork from marinade and reserve 2 tablespoons marinade. In a small bowl whisk together honey and reserved 2 tablespoons marinade. Grill pork on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals, turning it over every 2 minutes, 6 minutes total. Baste pork with honey mixture and cook pork, turning and basting it every 2 minutes, 10 minutes more. Discard any remaining honey mixture. Continue to cook pork, turning it every 2 minutes, until a thermometer diagonally inserted 2 inches into center of pork registers 155°F, about 6 minutes. Let pork stand 5 minutes before slicing on the diagonal.
