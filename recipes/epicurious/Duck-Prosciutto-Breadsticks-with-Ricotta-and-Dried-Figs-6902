Preheat oven to 350°F. Toast breadsticks on a baking sheet in middle of oven until golden, about 15 minutes. Wrap each breadstick with a slice of prosciutto, leaving ends of bread exposed, and keep, covered, at room temperature. Stir together ricotta, tarragon, figs, garlic (to taste), oil, 2 tablespoons milk, salt, and pepper. If too thick for dipping, stir in 1 or 2 tablespoons of remaining milk. Just before serving, drizzle ricotta dip with additional oil and serve with breadsticks.
