Cook parsley leaves in medium saucepan of boiling salted water 1 minute. Drain. Immediately transfer parsley leaves to blender. Add 1/3 cup cold water and large pinch of salt. Blend until very smooth. Combine 1 1/2 cups milk and onions in medium saucepan. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium; simmer until onions are tender, about 5 minutes. Place potatoes in large pot of salted water. Bring water to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium. Cover and cook until potatoes are tender, about 35 minutes. Drain. Return potatoes to pot. Add butter, parsley puree, and hot milk mixture. Mash potatoes with skin until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand uncovered at room temperature. Stir over medium heat until heated through, adding more milk if necessary.)
