Bring cream, milk, and cinnamon to a simmer in a small saucepan. Remove from heat and whisk in chocolate until melted. Whisk together yolks, sugar, and a pinch of salt, then whisk in chocolate mixture. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl and cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally. Preheat oven to 300°F with rack in middle. Line a roasting pan with a folded kitchen towel and put ramekins on towel. Divide custard among ramekins and add enough boiling-hot water to pan to reach halfway up them. Cover pan tightly with foil and poke a few holes in it. Carefully transfer pan to oven and bake until custards are set around edge but slightly wobbly in center, about 30 minutes. Cool custards on a rack, uncovered, about 1 hour, then chill, covered, until cold, at least 3 hours.
