Whisk egg yolks and 3 tablespoons water in medium metal bowl. Set bowl over saucepan of barely simmering water. Whisk until mixture is light and foamy and thermometer inserted into center registers 160°F, about 2 minutes. Whisk in shallot-wine reduction and chopped tarragon. Season sabayon with salt and pepper. Remove from heat. Immediately sprinkle fish with sea salt and pepper; brush with canola oil. Grill until slightly charred and just opaque in center, about 3 minutes per side. Divide bok choy among 4 plates. Place tilapia alongside bok choy. Spoon warm béarnaise sabayon over fish.
