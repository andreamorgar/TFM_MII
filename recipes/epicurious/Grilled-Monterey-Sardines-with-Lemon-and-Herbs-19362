Place sardines in 11 x 7 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Sprinkle fish with 1 teaspoon coarse salt. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Combine cilantro, parsley, and lemon peel in small bowl. Mix olives and onion in another small bowl. Brush sardines lightly with oil. Sprinkle half of herb mixture over sardines; turn to coat. Grill sardines until just opaque in center, 1 to 2 minutes per side, depending on size. Arrange sardines on platter. Sprinkle with olive mixture, then remaining herb mixture. Sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper. Garnish with lemon wedges.
