Preheat oven to 450°F. Place onion wedges on baking sheet. Brush with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Sprinkle with sugar. Season onion wedges with salt and pepper. Roast onion wedges until golden brown, turning occasionally, about 30 minutes. Combine all remaining ingredients in large bowl. Chop roasted onion. Mix onion and remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil into tomato mixture. Season salsa to taste with salt and pepper. (Salsa can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover tightly and refrigerate. Bring salsa to room temperature before using.)
