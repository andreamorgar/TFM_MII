Cut zucchini lengthwise into 1/8-inch-thick slices with slicer. Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot, then sauté half of zucchini with 1/4 tsp each of salt and pepper, stirring and turning frequently with tongs, until just tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and repeat with remaining oil and zucchini. Return first batch of zucchini to skillet. Add tarragon, lemon juice, and salt to taste and toss to combine.
