Tear chiles into large pieces and toast in a dry heavy skillet over moderate heat, about 30 seconds on each side. Soak chiles in 1/2 cup hot water in a 1-cup glass measure to soften. Mash tamarind with remaining 1/2 cup hot water to soften and force through a sieve into a bowl, discarding solids. Purée chiles with soaking water, orange juice, lemon juice, garlic, vinegar, oil, and mustard in a blender. Add tamarind mixture and honey and blend well. Pour through sieve into a small saucepan and simmer, partially covered (mixture will spatter) and stirring occasionally, until thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
