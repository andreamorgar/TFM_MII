Prepare grill. In a small saucepan melt butter with honey, chili powder, and cayenne. Remove pan from heat and stir in juice and salt and pepper to taste. Rinse and pat hen halves dry and season with salt. Grill hen halves, skin sides down, on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 5 minutes. Turn halves over with metal tongs and grill, basting with spice mixture, 20 minutes more. Grill halves, without basting, until cooked through, about 10 minutes more. (Alternatively, grill hen halves in an oiled, hot, well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat.)
