Add butter and Frangelico and process until crumbs are evenly moistened. Press crumb mixture onto bottom of prepared pan. Bake 10 minutes. Cool on rack. Maintain oven temperature. Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese with 1/2 cup sugar until light and fluffy. Add yolks 1 at a time, beating after each addition until just blended. Add sour cream, flour, Frangelico and vanilla and beat just until mixture is smooth. Stir in ground praline. Using clean dry beaters, beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually add 1/3 cup sugar and beat until stiff but not dry. Fold egg whites into cream cheese mixture in two additions. Pour filling into prepared crust. Bake cake until center is just set, about 50 minutes. Turn off oven and leave cake in oven 40 minutes longer. Transfer cheesecake to rack and cool to room temperature. Cut around pan sides with small sharp knife to loosen cheesecake. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Release pan sides. Beat whipping cream and 2 tablespoons sugar to firm peaks. Transfer to pastry bag fitted with medium star tip. Pipe rosettes of cream decoratively around edge of cake. Arrange 1 hazelnut atop each rosette. Dust top of cheesecake with cocoa powder.
