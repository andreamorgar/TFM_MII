Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add next 6 ingredients. Cover and cook until onion is soft, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes. Add coconut milk and next 4 ingredients and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered 1 hour. Strain into large saucepan, pressing on solids in strainer. If necessary, simmer broth until reduced to 4 cups. Meanwhile, cook yam cubes in large saucepan of boiling salted water until just tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Using skimmer, transfer yam to bowl. Add Yukon Gold potatoes to same saucepan and cook until just tender, about 10 minutes. Drain; add to bowl with yam. DO AHEAD: Broth and potatoes can be made 1 day ahead. Cool, cover separately, and chill. Bring coconut-carrot broth to simmer over medium heat. Add all cooked potatoes, sugar snap peas, red bell pepper, and carrot. Simmer until all vegetables are tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Place flour in shallow bowl. Combine 1/2 cup water and egg in another shallow bowl; whisk to blend. Place panko in third shallow bowl. Sprinkle fish pieces with salt and pepper. Coat in flour, then egg mixture, then panko. Pour enough oil into large nonstick skillet to coat bottom. Heat oil over medium-high heat. Add fish to skillet. Cook until golden and crisp and just opaque in center, about 3 minutes per side.
