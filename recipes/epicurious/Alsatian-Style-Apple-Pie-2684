Blend flour, sugar, and salt in processor. Add butter and shortening; cut in using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal. Blend in enough ice water using on/off turns until dough begins to form clumps. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate 1 hour. Whisk eggs and 1/2 cup sugar in large bowl to blend. Whisk in cream, milk, kirsch, and spices. Cook 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until butter begins to brown, about 2 minutes. Whisk into cream mixture. Set custard aside. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in same skillet over medium heat. Add apples and remaining 1/4 cup sugar; sauté until apples begin to soften, about 8 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high; sauté until apples are tender and golden brown, about 7 minutes longer. Cool. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 12 1/2-inch round. Transfer to 9-inch-diameter pie dish. Fold dough edges under and crimp decoratively. Pierce crust all over with fork. Freeze 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 400°F. Line crust with foil. Fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake 10 minutes. Remove foil and beans. Bake until crust is golden, about 15 minutes longer. Cool slightly. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F. Arrange apple mixture in pie shell. Pour custard over. Bake until knife inserted into center comes out clean, covering crust with foil if browning too quickly, about 40 minutes. Transfer pie to rack and cool slightly. Serve warm.
