Boil syrup ingredients in a large saucepan until reduced to 3/4 cup. Whisk together flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl, then stir in currants. Stir together yogurt and eggs with a fork in another bowl and stir into flour mixture with melted butter just until incorporated. Heat a lightly greased large nonstick skillet over moderately low heat until hot. Pour 1/4-cup measures of batter into skillet in batches, forming 3 1/2-inch cakes, and cook about 3 minutes, or until undersides are golden. Turn and cook 1 minute more, or until golden. Transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm in a 250°F oven while cooking remaining cakes. Serve griddlecakes with warm syrup.
