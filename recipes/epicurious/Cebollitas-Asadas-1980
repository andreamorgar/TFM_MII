Prepare grill. Trim roots and ends from spring onions or scallions, leaving about 8 inches of stalk. Onions or scallions may be prepared up to this point 6 hours ahead and chilled in a sealed plastic bag. In a sealable plastic bag or large bowl toss onions or scallions with oil and salt. Grill onions or scallions on a rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals, turning them with tongs 3 or 4 times, 5 to 7 minutes, or until softened and lightly charred. (Alternatively, onions or scallions may be broiled on rack of a broiler pan about 3 inches from heat, turning them with tongs 2 or 3 times, 10 to 12 minutes.) Transfer onions or scallions to a platter and squeeze 4 lime wedges over them. Garnish platter with additional lime wedges.
