Rinse rice in a large bowl with cool water until water runs clear. Drain rice. Combine rice, coconut cream, sugar, salt, and 2 cups water in a medium saucepan. Bring just to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar, then cover and reduce heat to low. (Alternatively, cook rice in an electric rice steamer.) Cook until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 40-45 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork; cover and let sit for 20 minutes.
