Combine the water, butter, salt and sugar and heat until the butter is melted. Add the flour and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until the dough forms a firm ball and breaks away from the edges of the pan. Remove the dough from the pan and beat in the eggs, one by one. If the eggs are very large, you may not need 4, if they are small, you may need more. Use enough to make the pâte à choux firm, smooth and waxy. Add the cheese, mustard and a few grains of cayenne to the pâte à choux and blend thoroughly. Butter a baking sheet and drop the dough by spoonfuls, or force it through the plain tube of a pastry bag, making small round mounds on the sheets. Sprinkle with a little additional cheese and a little cayenne or a few dashes of Tabasco. Bake in a 375°F oven for 35 to 40 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the gougère to dry out in the oven for a few minutes before removing them. This will prevent them from weeping—that is, showing drops of moisture. Serve the gougère either hot or cold.
