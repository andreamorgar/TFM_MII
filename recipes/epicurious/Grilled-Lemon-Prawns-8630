In a large bowl stir together the oil, the herbs, the zest, the salt, and the pepper, add the prawns, and toss them to coat them well. Let the prawns marinate, covered and chilled, for at least 1 hour or overnight. Stir in the lemon juice, let the mixture stand at room temperature for 30 minutes, and drain the prawns in a fine sieve. Grill the herb-coated prawns on a rack set about 4 inches over glowing coals for 3 minutes on each side, or until they are cooked through. (Alternatively, the prawns may be broiled on the rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 4 minutes on each side.) Divide the prawns among 8 plates and serve them with the lemon wedges.
