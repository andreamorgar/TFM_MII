1. In a sauté pan, heat the olive oil and add the onion and peppers. Cook until softened, about 5 minutes. 2. In a small bowl, mix together the cumin, turmeric, coriander, chili powder, paprika, thyme, cayenne, salt, and pepper, and set aside. 3. Crumble the tofu into bite—sized pieces with a fork and add to the sauté pan. Sprinkle the spice mixture over the tofu to coat and sauté for about 5 minutes. Serve at once with the home fries.
