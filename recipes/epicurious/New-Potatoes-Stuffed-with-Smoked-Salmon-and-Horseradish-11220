Preheat oven to 400°F. Cut potatoes in half crosswise. Mix with oil in bowl. Place cut side down on heavy large baking sheet. Bake potatoes until just tender, about 25 minutes. Cool completely. Mix 3 1/2 ounces salmon, sour cream, onion, 1 teaspoon capers and horseradish in small bowl. Season with pepper. (Potatoes and salmon mixture can be made 1 day ahead. Cover separately and chill.) Cut thin slice off rounded end of each potato so that potatoes will stand upright. Turn potatoes over. Using melon baller or small spoon, scoop out some of center of each potato. Spoon 1 teaspoon filling into each. Garnish each with smoked salmon and caper. (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Cover and chill.)
