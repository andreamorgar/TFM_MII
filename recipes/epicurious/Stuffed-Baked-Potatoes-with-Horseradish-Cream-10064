Preheat oven to 400° F. Pierce potatoes several times with fork. Place on oven rack; bake until crisp outside and cooked through, about 1 hour. Transfer to small baking sheet; cool 5 minutes. Cut off top third of potatoes. Scoop potato from bottoms into large bowl, leaving 1/4-inch-thick shell. Scoop potato from tops and add to same bowl; discard tops. Mash potato with 6 tablespoons sour cream, butter and 2 tablespoons horseradish. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon into potato shells, dividing equally. Mix 1/2 cup sour cream, 2 tablespoons horseradish and dill in small bowl. (Potatoes and sour cream topping can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.) Preheat oven to 400° F. Place potatoes in baking pan and cook until heated through and golden brown, about 50 minutes. Spoon sour cream topping on each. Serve, passing remaining sour cream topping separately.
