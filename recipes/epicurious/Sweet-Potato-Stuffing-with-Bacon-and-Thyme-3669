Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 350°F. Spread bread cubes in single layer on large baking sheet; bake until almost firm to touch, about 10 minutes. Cool. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Store in airtight container at room temperature. Place bread cubes in extra-large bowl. Cook bacon in heavy large pot over medium heat until crisp. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels to drain. Pour off and discard all but 3 tablespoons bacon drippings from pot; place pot over medium-high heat. Add butter, then sweet potatoes, onions, celery, thyme, and 1 1/4 teaspoons coarse salt to pot. Sauté until onions are slightly soft but not brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Add orange juice and bring to boil; cook until sweet potatoes are almost tender and juice is almost absorbed, about 5 minutes. Add bacon and sweet potato mixture to bowl with bread cubes. Season with more salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cool slightly. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill. Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 15 x 10 x 2- inch glass baking dish.
