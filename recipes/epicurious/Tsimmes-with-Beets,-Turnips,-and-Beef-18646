1. Mix 2 teaspoons of the salt and pepper and rub it into the beef. Place in a Dutch oven or heavy pot with the onions and brown slowly over a medium heat. Add the flour, mixing well. Add the water, stirring, until it reaches the boiling point. Cover and simmer slowly for about 1 hour. 2. Mix the honey in with the meat, then add the vegetables and remaining salt. Cover and bake in a preheated 375-degree oven for an hour and a half, removing the cover for the last 15 to 20 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings, if necessary.
