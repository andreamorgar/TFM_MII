Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain. Rinse under cold water; drain well. Transfer to large bowl. Whisk oil and vinegar in small bowl to blend. Pour over pasta and toss to coat. Add tomatoes, artichokes, green onions, and basil; toss to coat. Season generously with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate pasta salad at least 2 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.) Mix goat cheese into salad. Serve cold or at room temperature.
