Mix first 9 ingredients in large bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Mix in 1/4 cup breadcrumbs and egg. Shape crab mixture into eight 2 1/2-inch-diameter patties, using scant 1/2 cup mixture for each. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover; chill.) Place 3 cups breadcrumbs in shallow dish. Coat crab cakes in breadcrumbs, pressing to adhere. Melt 1 tablespoon butter with 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add 4 crab cakes and cook until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining butter, oil and crab cakes. Divide among 4 plates. Serve with salsa.
