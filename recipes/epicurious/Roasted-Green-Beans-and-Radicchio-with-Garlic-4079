Position 2 racks in center of oven; preheat to 450°F. Divide green beans and garlic between 2 heavy large rimmed baking sheets, spreading in single layer. Drizzle with olive oil; sprinkle with salt and crushed red pepper. Roast until green beans begin to brown, about 15 minutes. Divide radicchio and vinegar between sheets; toss. Continue roasting until vegetables are tender and browned in spots, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
