Whisk cream, goat cheese and dried cranberries in heavy small saucepan over medium-low heat until cheese melts. Simmer until sauce is reduced to 1 1/4 cups, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and keep warm. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.) Press pepper onto both sides of lamb. Sprinkle lamb with salt. Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add lamb to skillet; cook to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer lamb to plates. Add pine nuts to sauce and rewarm if necessary. Stir in basil. Pour sauce over lamb and serve.
