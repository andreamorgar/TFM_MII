Preheat an electric sandwich press (or waffle iron). Make 2 sandwiches, dividing the cheese and turkey evenly between them. Spread the outside of each sandwich with the butter and cook both on the press or iron. (Or cook the sandwiches in a heavy sauté pan over medium heat, turning once, until the outsides are browned and the cheese has melted.) Serve with the chutney, cranberry sauce, or preserves. Cut off the crusts and press the sandwiches in a waffle iron for the kid-friendliest of presentations (about 2 minutes). Serve with a fruit spread, such as peach or apricot jam.
