Heat oven to 350°F. Line 16 cups of two 12-cup mini-muffin pans with mini-muffin papers. In a bowl, combine flours and baking soda. In another bowl, cream together sugar and butter with an electric mixer on medium. Add egg white, sweet potato and vanilla; beat on low until well combined. Add flour mixture and milk; beat on low until just combined. Do not overmix. Fill muffin cups 2/3 full. Bake until a toothpick comes out clean, 15 to 18 minutes. Cool 10 minutes in pans; remove from pans and cool completely. In a third bowl, beat confectioners' sugar, cream cheese and spices until smooth. Frost cupcakes; garnish with cranberries.
