Using meat mallet, pound chicken breast halves between sheets of plastic wrap to 1/2-inch thickness. Sprinkle chicken with 1 teaspoon chopped fresh herbs, salt, and pepper. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and sauté until cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to plate and tent with foil. Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter to same skillet and cook until brown, about 1 minute. Add brussels sprouts and endive and sauté until golden, adding broth to moisten, about 3 minutes. Add vinegar; toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Mix in remaining 1 teaspoon herbs. Divide vegetables between plates. Top with chicken and serve.
