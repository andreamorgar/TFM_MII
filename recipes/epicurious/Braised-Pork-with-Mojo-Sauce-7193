Preheat oven to 400°F. Combine pork, broth, half of garlic, bay leaves, salt, and pepper in large ovenproof pot. Cover tightly; bake until pork is very tender, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer pork to bowl. Boil liquid in pot until reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 30 minutes. Return pork to pot; simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and remaining garlic; sauté until onion is tender and golden brown, about 12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer pork to plates; spoon some pan juices over. Top with sautéed onion mixture. Serve with Mojo Sauce.
