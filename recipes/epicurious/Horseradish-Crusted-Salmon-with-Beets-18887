Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add shallots; sauté 5 minutes. Add wine, bay leaf and 1 tablespoon thyme; boil until mixture is reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add beets and 4 cups stock; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until beets are tender and liquid is reduced to 1 cup, about 50 minutes. Place salmon on rimmed baking sheet. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in small saucepan; brush over salmon. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Mix panko, horseradish and 1 tablespoon thyme in small bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Press mixture onto salmon, dividing equally. (Can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover beet mixture and salmon separately; chill.) Preheat oven to 475°F. Bake salmon just until cooked through and top is golden brown, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons butter in large skillet over medium heat. Add carrots and 1/4 cup stock; cover and simmer 2 minutes. Add brussels sprout leaves; cook, uncovered, until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat. Bring beet mixture to simmer in heavy medium saucepan. Add 2 tablespoons butter; stir just until melted. Spoon beet mixture into 4 shallow soup plates. Top with fish. Garnish with carrots and brussels sprouts.
