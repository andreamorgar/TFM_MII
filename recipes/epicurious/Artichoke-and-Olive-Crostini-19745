Preheat broiler. Arrange bread slices in 1 layer on a baking sheet and brush tops with 1 1/2 tablespoons oil (total). Broil 4 to 6 inches from heat until golden on top, about 30 seconds. Turn toasts over and broil until golden, about 30 seconds more. Transfer toasts to a rack to cool. Pulse artichokes with cream in a food processor until finely chopped. Transfer mixture to a bowl and stir in salt and pepper to taste. Stir together olives, onion, and 1/2 tablespoon oil in a small bowl. Spread toasts evenly with artichoke cream and top with olive mixture. Drizzle with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil just before serving.
