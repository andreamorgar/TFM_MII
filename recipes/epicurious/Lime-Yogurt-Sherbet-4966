Whisk together cornstarch and 1 cup sugar in a 1 1/2- to 2-quart heavy saucepan, then slowly whisk in milk. Bring to a boil over moderate heat, whisking, then simmer, whisking occasionally, 2 minutes. Whisk together yolk and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a bowl and add hot milk in a slow stream, whisking constantly. Transfer to saucepan and cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until slightly thicker and a thermometer registers 170°F. (Do not let boil.) Pour custard into a clean bowl. Whisk in zest, juice, and yogurt. Chill until cold. Freeze custard in ice-cream maker. Transfer to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden. Serve in waffle cups if desired.
