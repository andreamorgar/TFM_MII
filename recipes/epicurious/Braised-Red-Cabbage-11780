Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add sliced cabbage and 1/2 teaspoon salt; stir and toss constantly until cabbage begins to wilt, about 7 minutes. Add red wine or hard cider and sauté until liquid evaporates, about 10 minutes. Add red wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar; stir constantly until cabbage is tender and turns bright fuchsia color, about 13 minutes longer. Season to taste with pepper and more salt, if desired. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cool slightly. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm, stirring over medium heat, before serving.)
