Peel and core the pineapples. Seed the limes, if necessary. Grind the pineapple with the limes in a meat grinder, using the coarsest blade. Put in a large pot with the sugar. Tie the bunch of mint securely, add to the pot and bring the mixture to a boil. Turn heat low, cover the pot and simmer for 1/2 hour, or until the fruits and rind are tender. Uncover, turn up the heat and boil vigorously until the mixture thickens and the juices become syrupy. Remove from heat, discard the bunch of mint, stir in the crème de menthe and the chopped mint leaves and pour into hot, sterilized jelly glasses. Cover with a thin layer of paraffin. When the paraffin has hardened, cover the glasses and store.
