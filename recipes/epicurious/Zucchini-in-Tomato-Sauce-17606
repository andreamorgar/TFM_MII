Heat the olive oil, add the garlic and cook 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and bring to a boil. Simmer slowly for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add salt, sugar, pepper and tomato paste and simmer again for 10 minutes. Add the zucchini and cook until just pierceable (about 15 minutes). Stir in the chopped basil and cool. Serve cold.
