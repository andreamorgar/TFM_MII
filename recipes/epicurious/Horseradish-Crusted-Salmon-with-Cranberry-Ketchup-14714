For ketchup: In a blender, combine cranberries, cider, shallots, salt and sugar. Puree until smooth. Stir in dill. For salmon: In a shallow bowl, mix flour and salt well. In a separate bowl, combine egg and vinegar. Beat until combined. Spread horseradish in yet another shallow bowl. Dip each salmon fillet in flour mixture, then egg mixture, then horseradish. Heat oil in a sauté pan and sauté salmon over medium heat until cooked through and golden brown, about 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Top each fillet with ketchup.
