In a small heavy saucepan combine the cream and the brown sugar, bring the mixture to a boil over moderately high heat, whisking occasionally, and boil it, whisking, until the brown sugar is dissolved. Remove the pan from the heat, add the chocolates, and whisk the mixture until they are melted. Whisk in the butter and the cinnamon, whisking until the sauce is smooth, and let the sauce cool slightly. The sauce may be made 1 week in advance and kept covered and chilled. Reheat the sauce over very low heat, stirring occasionally, until it is warm. Makes about 1 1/2 cups. In a bowl with an electric mixer beat the egg whites until they are foamy, add the cream of tartar, and beat the whites until they hold soft peaks. Add the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating, and beat the meringue until it holds stiff peaks. Sift the cocoa powder and the cinnamon over the meringue and fold them in gently but thoroughly. Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch star tip and pipe it into 5-inch rounds on baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Bake the meringues in the middle of a preheated 250°F. oven for 1 1/2 hours and let them cool on the sheets. The meringues may be made 10 days in advance and kept, separated with sheets of wax paper, in an airtight container. Arrange 1 meringue on each of 2 plates and top each meringue with a scoop of the ice cream and some of the cinnamon chocolate sauce.
