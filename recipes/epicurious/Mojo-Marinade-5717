Combine all ingredients in a medium bowl and whisk until salt is dissolved. Reserve 2/3 cup marinade for sauce. Put pork or seafood in a glass, stainless-steel, or ceramic dish. Toss with remaining marinade. Cover; chill for 3-8 hours. Remove pork or seafood from marinade, pat dry, and grill. Spoon reserved sauce over meat or fish just before serving.
