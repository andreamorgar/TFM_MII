Place the sugar and mint in a saucepan with 1 cup (250 ml) water and slowly bring to a boil, allowing the sugar to dissolve. Let simmer gently for 5 minutes, then remove from the heat and allow to infuse for 30 minutes. Place the blueberries and bourbon in a food processor or blender, and pour over the syrup, mint sprigs included. Blitz until completely smooth. Pour into six popsicle molds. Place the molds in the freezer. Let set for 2 hours, insert the popsicle sticks, and allow to freeze until completely solid (about 4 more hours).
