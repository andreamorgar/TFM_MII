Pat turkey cutlets dry with paper towels. Season generously with coriander, salt and pepper; dust lightly with flour. Melt butter in heavy large skillet over high heat. Working in batches, add turkey cutlets to skillet and sauté until cooked through, about 1 minute per side. Transfer turkey cutlets to platter after each batch is cooked and cover with foil to keep warm. Add orange slices and green onions to skillet and sauté until just heated through, about 2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, arrange oranges and onions atop turkey cutlets. Add broth and orange juice to skillet and boil until reduced to sauce consistency, about 6 minutes. Season sauce with salt and pepper; pour over turkey cutlets. Garnish with cilantro, if desired.
