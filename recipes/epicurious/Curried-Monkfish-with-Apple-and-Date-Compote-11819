Mix honey, mustard, curry and thyme in large bowl. Add fish pieces and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate 2 hours. Melt 4 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add apples and dates and sauté until apples are golden and almost tender, about 10 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water and simmer until thick syrup forms and apples are tender, about 5 minutes. Mix in vinegar. Season compote to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Cover and chill.) Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in another heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add fish and cook until just opaque in center, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer fish to plates. Meanwhile, stir compote over medium heat until warm. Spoon compote alongside fish and serve.
