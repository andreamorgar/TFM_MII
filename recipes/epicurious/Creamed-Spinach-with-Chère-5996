Preheat oven to 250°F. Bring 2 inches of water to boil in large pot. Add spinach and cook just until wilted, constantly pressing spinach down into water, about 2 minutes. Transfer 1/2 cup cooking liquid to medium skillet and reserve. Drain spinach into colander, firmly pressing out excess water. Transfer spinach to oven-proof platter. Place in oven to keep warm. Add cream, goat cheese, shallot and lemon peel to cooking liquid in skillet. Stir over medium-high heat until sauce is thick and reduced to 2/3 cup, about 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Pour sauce evenly over spinach. Serve immediately.
