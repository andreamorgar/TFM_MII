Chop 2 garlic cloves coarse and in a bowl stir together with shrimp, rosemary, and 2 tablespoons oil. Marinate shrimp, covered and chilled, at least 1 hour and up to 24. Prepare grill. In a small bowl soak bread in 1/4 cup water 15 minutes and squeeze out excess water. Chop remaining 5 garlic cloves fine and in a food processor purée with almonds, bread, and salt to taste until fluffy and very smooth. With motor running add remaining 1/2 cup oil in a slow stream, blending until sauce is emulsified, and blend in lemon juice. Transfer dipping sauce to a small bowl. Thread 2 shrimp onto each skewer and grill on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals until just cooked through, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve shrimp satés.
