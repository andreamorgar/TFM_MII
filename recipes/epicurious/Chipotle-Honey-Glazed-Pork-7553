Preheat oven to 450°F. Purée chipotles in adobo with garlic and honey in a blender until smooth. Pat pork dry and season with salt. Put pork on a foil-lined baking sheet and spread with chile glaze to coat well. Roast in middle of oven until an instant-read thermometer registers 155°F, about 20 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes on a cutting board before cutting into thin slices.
