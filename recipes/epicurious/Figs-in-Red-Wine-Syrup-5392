Tie zest, cinnamon, and peppercorns together in a cheesecloth bag. Bring wine, water, sugar, and cheesecloth bag to a boil in a 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Boil syrup until reduced to about 1 1/2 cups, 8 to 10 minutes. Add figs and simmer, covered, until soft and plump, 25 to 30 minutes. Discard cheesecloth bag and stir lemon juice into fig mixture. Cool at least 1 hour, then serve warm or at room temperature.
