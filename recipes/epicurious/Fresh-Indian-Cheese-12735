Bring milk to a full boil in a 6-quart heavy pot, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low and slowly stir in lemon juice. Cook until milk begins to separate, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove pot from heat and let milk stand 10 minutes. Pour mixture into a colander lined with a triple layer of cheesecloth. Rinse cheese curds under gently running lukewarm water. Gather up edges of cheesecloth, twisting gently to squeeze out as much water as possible, and transfer cheese in cheesecloth to a bowl, flattening into a disk. Weight cheese with a bowl filled with water or a large can. Let paneer stand at room temperature 1 hour, or until firm, and pour off any liquid that has accumulated in bowl.
