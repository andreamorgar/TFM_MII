Cook onions in large pot of boiling water 2 minutes. Drain and cool. Peel onions. Preheat oven to 400°F. Transfer onions to rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss to coat. Bake until tender and golden, shaking pan occasionally to turn onions and brown, about 35 minutes. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic; sauté 1 minute. Add stock; boil until liquid is reduced to 1 cup, about 10 minutes. Add onions, artichokes and peas; simmer until onions and peas are crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Add 4 tablespoons butter; stir until melted. Season with salt and pepper.
