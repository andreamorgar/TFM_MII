Whisk lemon juice, oil, garlic, 3 tablespoons thyme, rosemary, and sage in a small bowl; set marinade aside. Season chickens with salt and pepper inside and out. Place each inside a resealable plastic bag; divide marinade between bags. Spread marinade evenly to distribute. Seal bags and chill for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours. Preheat oven to 450°F. Transfer chickens from bags to a small roasting pan; gently blot excess oil from marinade with paper towels, leaving herbs intact on chicken skin. Stuff each chicken with a lemon half and several thyme sprigs. Tie legs together with kitchen twine, if desired. Roast until well browned, 30-35 minutes. Reduce heat to 350°F and continue roasting, occasionally basting chickens with pan juices, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165°F, 20-30 minutes longer. Transfer chickens to a carving board; let rest for 20 minutes before carving. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, capers, and red pepper flakes. Season with salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is soft but not brown, about 5 minutes. Add peppers and chiles; season with salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, 10-12 minutes. Stir in caper brine, corn, parsley, and vinegar just before serving. Combine first 4 ingredients in a small bowl. Stir in oil. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill. Let come to room temperature before serving. Serve with chickens and peppers and corn.
