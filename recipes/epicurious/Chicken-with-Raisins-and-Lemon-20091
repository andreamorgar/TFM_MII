Arrange chicken in single layer in large Dutch oven. Drizzle oil over. Tuck potatoes between chicken pieces. Sprinkle with garlic and turmeric. Season with salt and pepper. Lay lemon slices over. Sprinkle with raisins. Pour over enough broth barely to cover chicken. Bring to boil over high heat. Cover and boil 10 minutes. Uncover; reduce heat to medium and simmer until chicken is just cooked through and potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Transfer chicken and potatoes to platter. Tent with foil to keep warm. Add lemon juice to Dutch oven. Boil cooking liquid until thickened to light sauce consistency and reduced by half, about 7 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon over chicken and serve.
