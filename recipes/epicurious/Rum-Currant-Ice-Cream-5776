Heat rum in a small saucepan until just warm, then remove from heat. Add currants and let stand, covered, 1 hour. Bring cream, half-and-half, and salt just to a boil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan. Whisk together eggs and brown sugar in a large bowl, then add hot cream mixture in a slow stream, whisking. Pour custard into saucepan and cook over moderately low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until thick enough to coat back of spoon and an instant-read thermometer registers 170 to 175°F, about 5 minutes (do not let boil). Pour custard through a sieve into a bowl, then add rum and currants and cool completely, stirring occasionally. Chill, covered, until cold, at least 3 hours. Freeze custard in ice cream maker. Transfer ice cream to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden. (Due to rum, this ice cream will have a slightly softer texture than others.)
