Preheat the oven to 350°. Crumble and fry the Chorizo in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat for 5 minutes to render some of the fat. Put the sausage meat and 3 tablespoons of the fat in a large bowl. Add the cornmeal, baking powder, salt, eggs, sour cream, corn, chiles, and 1 1/4 cps of the cheese. Mix all ingredients thoroughly. Generously butter a 1 1/2 quart casserole, 9 by 9-inch baking dish, or 10-inch heavy skillet. Spoon in the cornbread batter. Sprinkle the top with the remaining 3/4 cup cheese. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes, until the cornbread turns golden and smells wonderful. Serve hot.
