Preheat oven to 300°F. Combine garlic and oil in a very small metal bowl and set on a baking sheet. Bake in lower third of oven 1 hour. Cool on a rack 30 minutes. Pour oil through a small sieve into another bowl and discard garlic. Whisk together yeast and warm water in bowl of a standing electric mixer and let stand 5 minutes, or until creamy. Stir 1/3 cup garlic oil into yeast mixture. Whisk together 7 cups flour and table salt and stir half of flour into yeast mixture. Fit mixer with dough-hook attachment. Add remaining flour and mix on low speed 3 minutes, or until dough pulls away from side of bowl, adding more flour if necessary. Knead dough with dough hook on medium-high speed, scraping down hook and side of bowl as needed, 5 minutes, or until dough is soft and slightly sticky. Transfer dough to a large oiled bowl, turning with floured hands to coat with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 450°F. Oil a 17- by 11-inch baking pan with some of garlic oil. Gently press dough into pan, allowing dough to rest 5 minutes if difficult to work with. Cover dough with oiled plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 30 minutes. Make indentations in dough at 1-inch intervals with oiled fingertips. Drizzle with remaining garlic oil and sprinkle with rosemary, coarse salt, and pepper. Bake in lower third of oven until deep golden on top and pale golden on bottom, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer bread to a rack and serve warm or at room temperature.
