In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, sweetener, coconut milk, cinnamon, and coconut extract. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let the mixture chill in the fridge for at least 1 hour or overnight. Pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions for frozen yogurt. In the last 5 minutes of the maker's cycle, add the shredded coconut.
