Combine walnuts, sugar, 2 teaspoons oil, and 1 tablespoon vinegar in medium nonstick skillet. Stir over medium heat until syrup coats nuts thickly, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer nuts to piece of foil. Separate nuts; freeze on foil 5 minutes or cool completely at room temperature. Whisk remaining 1/4 cup oil, 2 1/2 tablespoons vinegar, and garlic in large bowl. Season dressing with salt and pepper. Add Bibb lettuce, radicchio, haricots verts, and nuts; toss to coat.
