Arrange triangles in a shallow baking pan (1 inch deep), then brush tops with butter and sprinkle with salt. Bake until golden, 10 to 12 minutes, then cool.

Top each toast with 1/2 teaspoon curried herring. *Look for jarred fillet pieces of herring (sometimes labeled "Tidbits") sold in the refrigerated section of the supermarket.
