Lay the bread slices on a work surface. Spread the peanut butter on one slice and the cream cheese on the other. Arrange strawberry slices in an even single layer on top of the peanut butter. Drizzle the honey on the berries and then place the other slice of bread with the cream cheese on top. Cut into halves or quarters.
