Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 450°F. Butter a 3-quart shallow baking dish. Cook shallot in butter in a small heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle with flour and curry powder and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add cream and bring to a boil, whisking constantly, then remove from heat and whisk in 1/4 teaspoon salt. Fold each piece of fish in half, skinned side in, and arrange pieces in 1 layer in baking dish. Sprinkle fish with pepper and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Pour sauce over fish and bake until fish is just cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes.
