In a small saucepan stir together the sugar, the water, the lemon juice, and the ginger root and simmer the mixture, covered, for 5 minutes. Add the apricots, baste them with the syrup, and poach them, covered, over moderately low heat for 3 minutes, or until they are just tender. Stir in the raspberries gently, poach the mixture for 1 minute, and divide it between 2 bowls. Sprinkle the compote with the almonds, garnish it with the mint, and serve it warm or at room temperature.
