Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Combine chili sauce, bourbon, mustard and soy sauce in heavy medium saucepan. Simmer over medium heat until sauce is reduced enough to coat spoon, whisking occasionally, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle both sides of chops with salt and pepper. Brush 1 side of chops generously with sauce. Place chops, sauce side down, on grill. Brush chops generously with remaining sauce. Grill until cooked through and glazed, about 3 minutes per side.
