Brush zucchini, eggplants, tomatoes, and peppers with extra-virgin olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill until each is tender. Put 2 tbsp olive oil and onion in a nonstick pan and sauté over medium-low heat, stirring until onion becomes brown and syrupy, about 15 to 20 minutes. In a food processor, puree onion, lima beans, Parmesan, parsley, lemon zest, and thyme. While machine is running, add remaining 2 tbsp olive oil and broth. Season with salt and pepper. Grill or toast both sides of each flatbread. Remove from heat and spread with bean puree. Layer on vegetables. Cut in half.
