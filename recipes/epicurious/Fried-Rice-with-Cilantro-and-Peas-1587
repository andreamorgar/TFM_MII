Chop cilantro and thinly slice scallions. In a large nonstick skillet cook cumin seeds in oil over moderately high heat, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add rice and fry, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 3 minutes. Add vinegar and soy sauce, stirring to coat rice, and stir-fry until liquid is evaporated. Stir in cilantro, scallions, and peas and stir-fry until heated through, about 2 minutes, seasoning with salt if necessary.
