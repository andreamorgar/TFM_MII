Combine first 6 ingredients in heavy pot. Bring to boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until mixture thickens slightly, about 10 minutes. Transfer to medium bowl. Refrigerate compote until cold. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.) Spoon into bowls. Top with sorbet and serve.
