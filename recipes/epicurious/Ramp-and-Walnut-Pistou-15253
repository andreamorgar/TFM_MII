Preheat oven to 350°F. Toast walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, 8–10 minutes. Let cool. Coarsely chop; place in a medium bowl. Heat a dry medium cast-iron skillet over high. Add ramps and cook, turning occasionally, until bulbs and greens are evenly charred. Remove from skillet and let cool. Coarsely chop and add to bowl with walnuts. Add oil and vinegar and toss to coat; season with salt and pepper. Pistou (without vinegar) can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.
