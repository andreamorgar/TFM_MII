Preheat oven to 475°F. Run fingers under skin of chicken breasts to loosen; rub 1/2 teaspoon rosemary under skin of each. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper; place in medium ovenproof skillet. Toss garlic, oil and remaining 1 teaspoon rosemary in small bowl to coat. Arrange garlic around chicken. Drizzle any remaining oil mixture over chicken. Roast chicken 15 minutes. Add broth to skillet. Continue to roast until chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer chicken and garlic to plates. Add wine to skillet; boil 1 minute to reduce pan juices slightly. Spoon pan juices over chicken and garlic.
