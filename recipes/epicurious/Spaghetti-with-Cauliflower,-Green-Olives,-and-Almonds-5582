Pulse olives and parsley in a food processor until coarsely chopped. Transfer to a bowl. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook cauliflower with salt, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Add garlic and red-pepper flakes and cook, stirring occasionally, until cauliflower is tender and garlic is golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in water and boil 1 minute. Add olive mixture and cook, stirring, until heated through, about 2 minutes. Meanwhile, cook pasta in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta-cooking water. Drain in a colander and return to pot. Add cauliflower mixture and toss well, then add cheese and toss again. If pasta is dry, moisten with some reserved cooking water. Sprinkle pasta with almonds and serve immediately, with additional cheese on the side.
