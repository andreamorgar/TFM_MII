Preheat oven to 475°F. Cut two 16x12-inch pieces aluminum foil or parchment. Fold in half to make two 8x12-inch rectangles. Open foil on work surface. Cut salmon fillet crosswise into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Overlap half of salmon strips on half of each foil piece. Sprinkle bay scallops over. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with sliced green onion and chopped dill, then drizzle with lemon juice and dot with butter. Fold second half of foil over fish. Fold in foil edges and pinch tightly to seal. Place packages on baking sheet. Bake until packages puff and seafood is just cooked through, about 8 minutes. Transfer packages to plates. Cut top of packages open with small knife or scissors. Serve with lemon wedges.
