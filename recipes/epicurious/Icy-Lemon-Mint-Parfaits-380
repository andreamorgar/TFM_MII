Combine 2 cups mint leaves, 1 1/4 cups water, and sugar in medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to very low; cook 5 minutes without simmering. Pour through fine strainer into 8x8x2-inch glass baking dish. Cool to room temperature; mix in lemon juice. Cover and freeze until firm, stirring occasionally, at least 6 hours or overnight. Using electric mixer, beat cream, sugar, and mint in medium bowl until peaks form. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover and chill. Rewhisk to thicken before using.) Using fork, scrape granité to form crystals. Place 4 berry slices in each of 6 glasses. Top with 1 generous tablespoon minted cream, then 4 berry slices. Spoon 1/4 cup granité over. Repeat layering with berry slices, minted cream, and granité. Garnish each with berry slice and mint leaf.
