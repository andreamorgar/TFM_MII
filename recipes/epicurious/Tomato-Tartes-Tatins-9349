1. Preheat oven to 350°F. 2. Give the cherry tomatoes a squeeze to remove the seeds; set aside. 3. Divide the butter among 6 six-ounce ovenproof baking cups. Sprinkle them with the sugar. 4. Fill each cup with the cherry tomatoes, adding a layer of sun-dried tomatoes in the middles. 5. Cover loosely with foil and bake for 1 hour. 6. Gently press down the tomatoes (which will have shrunk), molding them to the shape of the cups. Bake, covered, for 45 minutes more. 7. Remove from the oven. Increase temperature to 425°F. 8. Roll the pastry out to 1/8 inch thick. Cut out 6 four-inch circles and poke them all over with a fork. 9. Top each cup with a pastry circle, pressing to seal. Bake for 15 minutes. 10. Remove and let cool for 15 minutes. Run a small, sharp knife around the rims and invert the tarts onto plates.
