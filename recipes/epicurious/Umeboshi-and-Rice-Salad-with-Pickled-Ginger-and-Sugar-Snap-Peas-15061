In a bowl rinse rice in several changes of cold water until water is almost clear and drain in a colander. Let rice stand, uncovered, in colander at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. In a 3-quart saucepan bring water to a boil with rice over high heat and boil, covered, 2 minutes. Reduce heat to moderate and boil rice, covered, 5 minutes more. Reduce heat to low and cook rice, covered, until liquid is absorbed, 10 to 15 minutes. Let rice stand, covered, 10 minutes and spread in a large shallow baking pan. Sprinkle rice with vinegar and toss with a wooden spoon to cool slightly. Pit umeboshi and coarsely chop umeboshi and ginger. In a bowl stir together rice, umeboshi, and ginger and cool to room temperature. Salad may be prepared up to this point 4 hours ahead and kept, covered, at cool room temperature. Have ready a bowl of ice and cold water. In a saucepan of boiling water cook peas until bright green, about 30 seconds, and transfer to ice water to stop cooking. Drain peas and cut crosswise into thin strips. Peas may be cooked 1 day ahead and chilled in a sealable plastic bag. Just before serving, stir peas into salad and season with salt.
