1. Combine the fennel, diced pepper, tuna, olives, beans, oil, capers, and 2 tablespoons of the parsley. Season with salt and pepper. 2. Shortly before serving, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until it is just tender, or al dente. Drain pasta well and add to the tuna and vegetables. Carefully fold together with a rubber spatula, trying not to break up the tuna. Remove to a decorative serving bowl and sprinkle with the remaining tablespoon of chopped parsley. Serve at room temperature.
