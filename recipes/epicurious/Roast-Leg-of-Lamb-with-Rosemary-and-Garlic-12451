Place lamb, fat side up, in large roasting pan. Sprinkle with salt. Mix oil, minced rosemary, lemon peel and garlic in bowl. Rub over lamb. Preheat oven to 350°F. Roast lamb until thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 130°F for medium-rare, basting occasionally with pan juices, about 1hours. Transfer to platter. Tent loosely with foil; let stand for 15 minutes. Spoon off fat from drippings in roasting pan; add 1/4 cup water to pan. Place on burner over medium heat. Add any lamb juices from platter. Bring to boil, scraping up browned bits on bottom of pan. Season with salt. Keep warm. Cut lamb into thin slices; arrange on platter. Pour pan juices over. Garnish with rosemary sprigs.
