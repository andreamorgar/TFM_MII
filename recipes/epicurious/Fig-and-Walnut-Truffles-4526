Heat cream, unsalted butter and corn syrup in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until just boiling, stirring occasionally. Remove saucepan from heat, add semisweet chocolate to cream mixture and stir until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth. Mix in Cognac. Add figs and walnuts and blend well. Spoon mixture into 8x8-inch glass dish with 2-inch-high sides. Cover and refrigerate until mixture is firm enough to handle, about 1 hour. Cut chocolate mixture into 36 squares. Roll each square by hand to form round. Dust rounds lightly with cocoa. Place truffles in foil-lined dish. Cover and chill until firm, at least 4 hours. (Can be prepared 4 days ahead.)
