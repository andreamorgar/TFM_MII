Generously cover eggs with cold water in a small heavy saucepan and bring just to a boil. Remove from heat and let eggs stand, covered, 5 minutes. Drain off water, then run cold water over eggs, cracking shells against side of pan. Peel eggs and return to saucepan. Add water (1/2 cup), soy sauce, and sugar. Simmer, shaking pan occasionally, until most of liquid has evaporated, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in sesame oil. Serve at room temperature.
