Using vegetable peeler, remove peel (colored part only) from fruit in 1 1/2- to 2-inch-long pieces. Cut peel into very thin strips (about 1/16 inch wide). Bring small saucepan of water to boil. Add strips and boil 5 minutes. Drain. Repeat. Bring sugar and 1/4 cup water to simmer in small saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves. Add blanched citrus peel, cover, and simmer 3 minutes. Transfer syrup with peel to small bowl. Cover and chill overnight. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Keep chilled.) Using slotted spoon, transfer citrus peel to paper towels to drain before using.
