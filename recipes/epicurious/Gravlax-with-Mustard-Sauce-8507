Mix salt, sugar, and white peppercorns. Take a handful and rub it on both sides of the salmon. Place the salmon in a dish, and sprinkle the rest of the mix on top. Cover the salmon with dill, and let it stand for 6 hours at room temperature. Refrigerate for 24-30 hours, depending on how thick the salmon is. Mix the mustard, sugar, and vinegar, and season with pinches of salt and pepper. Mix in the oil while you pour it in a steady stream. When the sauce has a mayonnaise-like consistency, stir in chopped dill. Slice the salmon off the skin in thin slices, and place them on a platter. Cut the skin in pieces, approximately 1/2" wide, and blacken them in a very hot cast-iron skillet. Decorate platter with lemon, dill, and skin.
