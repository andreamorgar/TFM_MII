Melt 3 tablespoons butter in large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add shrimp; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Sauté until almost opaque in center, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer shrimp to bowl. Add 1 tablespoon butter and shallots to same pan. Sauté 3 minutes. Add rice; stir 1 minute. Add wine. Stir until wine is absorbed, about 2 minutes. Add clam juice and bring to boil. Reduce heat. Simmer until rice is tender and risotto is creamy, stirring often, about 18 minutes. Meanwhile, blend remaining 2 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon basil, and tarragon in small bowl. Season herb butter to taste with salt and pepper. Mix shrimp, any accumulated juices, and 1 tablespoon basil into risotto. Simmer 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon risotto into shallow bowls. Swirl some herb butter into top of each. Serve, passing cheese separately.
