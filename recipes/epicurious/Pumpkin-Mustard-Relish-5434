Toss pumpkin with sugar and a pinch of salt in a large bowl. Let stand at room temperature, stirring occasionally, 1 hour. Chill, covered, 8 hours. (Sugar will liquefy.) Simmer pumpkin mixture, water, and wine in a wide 6-quart heavy pot until pumpkin is just tender, about 10 minutes. Transfer pumpkin with a slotted spoon to a bowl and stir in raisins, then boil cooking liquid until reduced to about 1 cup, about 10 minutes. Transfer syrup to a measuring cup, then slowly whisk into mustard in a small bowl until smooth. Stir into pumpkin mixture. Cool, then chill, covered, at least 8 hours for flavors to meld. Serve at room temperature.
