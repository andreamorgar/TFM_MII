In a bowl whisk together the vinegar, the mustard, and salt and pepper to taste, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. Stir in the onion and the parsley. Rub the steak with the garlic, discard the garlic, and sprinkle the steak with salt and pepper to taste. Broil the steak on the rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 4 to 5 minutes on each side for medium-rare meat and let it stand for 5 minutes. Divide the lettuce between 2 plates, arrange decoratively on the top the steak, sliced thin diagonally, and the orange sections, and drizzle some of the dressing over each salad. Serve the remaining dressing separately.
