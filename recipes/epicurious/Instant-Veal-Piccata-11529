Season veal with salt and pepper. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add veal and cook until tender, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer veal to platter and keep warm. Add garlic to skillet and sauté 30 seconds. Add wine and boil until wine is reduced to glaze, about 2 minutes. Stir in broth and capers. Simmer until mixture is reduced to 1/4 cup, about 2 minutes. Whisk in remaining 1 tablespoon butter and pour sauce over veal.
