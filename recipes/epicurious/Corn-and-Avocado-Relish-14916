In a heavy 2-quart saucepan combine all ingredients except avocados. Boil corn mixture, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes and cool completely. Corn mixture may be made 1 week ahead and chilled, covered. Strain corn mixture through a sieve into a bowl, reserving cooking liquid. Halve, pit, and peel avocados. In a bowl mash 1 avocado half. Finely chop remaining avocado and add to mashed avocado with corn mixture and 2 tablespoons reserved cooking liquid, tossing to combine well. Relish may be made 1 hour ahead and chilled, its surface covered with plastic wrap.
