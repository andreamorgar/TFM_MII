In a deep 12-inch skillet bring broth or water to a boil and add chicken breasts in one layer. Reduce heat and poach chicken at a bare simmer, turning once, 7 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and cool chicken in poaching liquid 20 minutes. Cut chicken into 1/4-inch cubes. In a large bowl stir together chicken, sour cram, scallion, lime juice, jalapeño, cumin, and salt and pepper to taste. Chill filling, covered, at least 2 and up to 3 hours. Preheat oven to 400°F and lightly coat 2 baking sheets with cooking spray. On a work surface arrange 1 phyllo rectangle with a short side facing you and lightly brush with egg wash. Put 1 heaping tablespoon filling in center of lower third of rectangle and fold long sides of phyllo over filling to cover. Lightly brush folded phyllo with egg wash and roll up jelly-roll fashion. Make more rolls with remaining phyllo and filling, brushing with egg wash in same manner. Arrange rolls, seam side down, on baking sheets and bake in batches in middle of oven 20 to 30 minutes, or until golden. Serve rolls with salsa if desired.
