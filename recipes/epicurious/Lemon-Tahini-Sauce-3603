Holding the parsley in a bunch, trim off and discard an inch or so from the bottom of the stems. Cut the bunch crosswise into thirds. Place in a colander, rinse, and drain. Bounce the colander up and down to shake off excess water. Place the tahini, parsley, garlic, 4 tablespoons lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons water into the bowl of a food processor. Blend well, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed and adding enough additional water and/or lemon juice to create a sauce with a smooth, pourable consistency and a nice puckery taste. (The amount of liquid you'll need to add will depend upon the thickness of the tahini and how much water adhered to the parsley.) Add the salt and cayenne (if using). Refrigerate until needed, for up to 1 week.
