Partially fill a boiling-water canner with hot water. Place in the canner a sufficient number of clean canning jars to hold the quantity of food prepared by the recipe. Cover and bring the water to a boil over high heat. This step generally requires 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the size of your canner. Place lids in boiling water 5 minutes before you are ready to fill the jars. Follow the manufacturer's directions. Remove jars from the canner and ladle or pack the food into hot jars to within 1/2 inch (1 cm) of top rim (head space). If the food is in large pieces, remove trapped air bubbles by sliding a clean small wooden or plastic spatula between glass and food; readjust the head space to 1/2 inch (1 cm). Wipe jar rim to remove any stickiness. Center lid on jar; apply screw band just until fingertip tight. Place jars in canner and adjust water level to cover jars by 1 inch (2.5 cm). Cover canner and return water to boil. Begin timing when water returns to a boil. Process for the exact time specified in the recipe. Remove jars from canner and cool for 24 hours. Check jar seals (sealed lids turn downward). Remove screw bands, dry and either replace loosely on jar or store separately. Label jars with contents and date and store in a cool, dark place.
