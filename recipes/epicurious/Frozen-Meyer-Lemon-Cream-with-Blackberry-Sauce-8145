Whisk 1/2 cup sugar, 5 tablespoons lemon juice, egg yolks, and corn syrup in small metal bowl to blend. Set bowl over saucepan of boiling water; whisk until mixture is thick and fluffy and thermometer inserted into mixture registers 180°F, about 3 minutes. Place bowl with yolk mixture over larger bowl filled with ice and water until mixture is cool, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, using electric mixer, beat cream, 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon peel, and 1 tablespoon sugar in medium bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold cooled yolk mixture into cream in 3 additions. Cover and freeze until firm, about 4 hours. Mix berries and any accumulated juices, remaining 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice, and 1/4 teaspoon lemon peel in small bowl; let stand 10 minutes. Coarsely mash half of berries in bowl to thicken juices. Scoop lemon cream into small bowls. Top each with 1 rounded tablespoon berry sauce and serve.
