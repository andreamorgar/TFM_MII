Crush 2 garlic cloves with the flat side of a large knife and mince remaining garlic clove. Chop pecans. Drain pimientos and rinse well. Pat pimientos dry between paper towels and chop. Coarsely grate cheddar. Preheat oven to 350° F. In an ovenproof heavy skillet cook crushed garlic in oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until pale golden. Discard garlic with a slotted spoon and stir pecans into oil. Cook pecans over moderate heat, stirring, 1 minute, and transfer skillet to oven. Toast pecans, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 5 minutes, and cool. In a bowl stir together cream cheese, mayonnaise, and minced garlic. Stir in remaining ingredients and salt and pepper to taste until combined well. Pack spread into a crock (or crocks) and chill, covered with plastic wrap, at least 1 day and up to 4. Let spread stand at room temperature 30 minutes and serve with crackers.
