Bring milk, rice, cardamom, cinnamon, and salt to a boil in a 3-quart heavy saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, stirring frequently, until rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Add sugar and cook, stirring, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Heat ghee in a 10-inch heavy skillet over medium heat until hot, then cook almonds, stirring, until golden. Add raisins and cook, stirring, until coated with ghee and slightly puffed. Stir almond mixture into rice pudding and serve warm.
