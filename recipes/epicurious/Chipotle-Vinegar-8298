In a small pot, toast the chipotles over medium heat for 2 minutes. Add the vinegar, bring to a simmer, and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and pour into an airtight container. Allow the vinegar to sit for at least 24 hours before using. Stored in a cool, dark place, this spicy vinegar will keep for 6 months.
