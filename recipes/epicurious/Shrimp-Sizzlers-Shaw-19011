Into a large saucepan of boiling salted water plunge shrimp and simmer until just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain shrimp in a colander and rinse under cold water. Pat shrimp dry and chop fine. In a bowl stir together shrimp, cheeses, cream, Sherry, and scallion. With a rolling pin flatten each bread slice into a 3/4-inch square. Put about 2 tablespoons shrimp mixture on each bread slice and roll up tightly. Put rolls, seam sides down, on a baking sheet and brush all over with butter. Chill rolls, covered loosely, at least 1 hour and up to 4. Preheat oven to 425°F. Cut shrimp rolls in half and arrange on baking sheet, seam sides down. Bake shrimp rolls until golden, about 12 minutes, and cool slightly. Serve shrimp sizzlers warm.
