In a heavy kettle cook bacon over moderate heat until brown. Increase heat to moderately high and add onion and cabbage with salt to taste. Sauté mixture, stirring occasionally, until vegetables soften and begin to brown. Add beans and water and bring to a boil. Gradually stir in cornmeal with salt to taste in a thin stream, stirring constantly, and cook over moderately low heat, stirring constantly, until polenta is thick and pulls away from side of kettle, about 40 minutes. Stir in oil. Serve polenta sprinkled with Parmesan. In a saucepan simmer beans (1/2 cup dried beans) in 4 cups water, covered, 45 minutes, or until tender, and remove pan from heat. Cool beans in cooking liquid and drain. Beans may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Makes about 1 1/2 cups. *available at specialty foods shops
