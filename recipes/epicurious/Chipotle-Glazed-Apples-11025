Line baking sheet with waxed paper. Mix sugar and cinnamon in medium bowl. Toss 1/4 of apple slices with cinnamon-sugar mixture to coat. Heat 1 tablespoon oil with 1 teaspoon chipotle chilies in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add coated apple slices. Cook until coating caramelizes and apple slices are heated through, turning often, about 4 minutes. Transfer apple slices to prepared sheet. Using paper towels, wipe skillet clean. Repeat with remaining apple slices, cinnamon-sugar mixture, oil and chipotle chilies in batches, wiping skillet clean between each batch. Serve warm or at room temperature. .
