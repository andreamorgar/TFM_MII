Combine pork, beef, corn chips, green onions, 1/4 cup chili sauce, egg, chili powder, salt and pepper in medium bowl. Mix to blend well. Divide mixture in half. Shape each half into 3/4-inch-high oval and place side by side in 8x8x2-inch baking pan. Spread remaining 1/4 cup chili sauce over meat loaves, dividing equally. (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Cover; refrigerate.) Preheat oven to 450°F. Bake meat loaves uncovered until juices run clear when centers are pierced with small sharp knife, about 20 minutes.
