Bring pitted prunes, 1 1/3 cups water, Sherry wine vinegar and sugar to boil in heavy medium saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to medium and cook until liquid is syrupy, about 20 minutes. Set prunes aside. Preheat oven to 400°F. Blend 1/4 cup olive oil, garlic cloves, chopped fresh rosemary and cracked black pepper in food processor to form paste. Place pork tenderloins in roasting pan; rub with 3 1/2 tablespoons garlic paste. Set remaining garlic paste aside. Roast pork tenderloins until thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 150°F, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat remaining garlic paste and dried crushed red pepper in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add 12 cups sliced escarole; cover and cook until wilted, about 6 minutes. Mix in chicken stock. Transfer pork to work surface and slice. Mix any pan juices from pork into prunes and bring to simmer. Divide escarole among 6 plates. Top with pork slices, then prunes. Serve immediately.
