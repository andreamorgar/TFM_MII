Cut the sweet potatoes crosswise into 1/4 inch slices with a large sharp knife and with a sharp 1- to 1 1/2-inch decorative cutter cut a decorative shape from each slice. Steam the sweet potatoes in a steamer set over boiling water, covered, for 5 to 6 minutes, or until they are just tender, arrange them in one layer on a plate, and let them cool, their surface covered with plastic wrap. Chill the sweet potatoes for at least 1 hour or overnight. The sweet potatoes my be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled. Arrange the sweet potatoes, patted dry, on serving plates, top each piece with 1/2 teaspoon of the crème fraîche and 1/8 teaspoon caviar, and garnish the "bites" with the dill.
