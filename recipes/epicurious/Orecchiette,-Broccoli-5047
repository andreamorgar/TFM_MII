Cut the broccoli into small flowerets and the pancetta into matchsticks. Peel and finely slice the garlic and crumble the chiles. Grate the Parmesan. Cook the broccoli in boiling salted water until soft. In a thick-bottomed pan, heat the olive oil, add the pancetta and garlic, and cook until soft but not crisp. Add the broccoli and chiles and season. Stir over gentle heat for a few minutes. Cook the orecchiette in boiling salted water until al dente. Drain, and add to the broccoli. Mix well, and serve with Parmesan.
