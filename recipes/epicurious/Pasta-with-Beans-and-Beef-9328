Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add onions and garlic; sauté 5 minutes. Add meat and red pepper. Sauté until meat is no longer pink, breaking up large pieces, about 5 minutes. Add 6 1/2 cups broth, beans and tomato sauce; bring to a boil. Mix in pasta. Reduce heat to medium, Simmer uncovered until pasta is just tender but still firm to the bite, stirring often and adding remaining broth by 1/4 cupfuls if mixture is too thick, about 12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
