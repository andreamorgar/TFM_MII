In a small bowl, soak sun-dried tomatoes in hot water 20 minutes to soften. Meanwhile, cook pasta in boiling salted water until tender, then drain in a colander and rinse under cold water to stop cooking. Heat oil in a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Sauté shrimp, onion, peppers, broccoli florets, garlic and oregano 5 minutes, adding a bit of water to prevent sticking if needed. Mince the softened sun-dried tomatoes and add to the pan with artichokes, tomato wedges and cooked pasta; continue to cook, stirring, about 2 minutes longer or until vegetables are tender and pasta is heated through. Add herbs; serve immediately.
