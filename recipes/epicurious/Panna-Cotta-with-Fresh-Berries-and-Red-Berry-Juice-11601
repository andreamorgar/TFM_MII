Divide each berry portion in half. In a small saucepan, stir together half the berries, 1/2 cup sugar, and 2 cups water. On a medium-low flame, reduce to a thick consistency, about 1 hour. Strain and chill. Dissolve gelatin in 2 tbsp warm water for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring; set aside. In a medium saucepan, combine half-and-half and 2/3 cup sugar. Cut vanilla beans in half; using a paring knife, scrape seeds from inside beans into saucepan; add beans. Slowly bring mixture to a boil. Whisk in milk and gelatin; strain beans and extra gelatin. Cool slightly; pour into 8 glasses; chill until set, about 8 hours. Top with 2 or 3 tbsp berry juice, remaining berries, whipped cream, and a sprig of mint.
