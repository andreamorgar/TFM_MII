In a bowl stir together black beans, tomato, jalapeños, 2 teaspoon lime juice, chili powder, and salt to taste. In a food processor purée avocado, yogurt, remaining 2 teaspoons lime juice, and salt to taste. (Alternatively, with a fork mash avocado mixture until smooth.) Spread avocado mixture evenly on tortillas and arrange turkey across each tortilla just below middle. Top turkey with salsa and coriander and roll up tortillas tightly, leaving ends open. Halve tortillas diagonally with a serrated knife.
