Cook bacon in heavy large skillet over medium heat until crisp. Using slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels (reserve as garnish for Spinach Salad with Shrimp and Fennel). Remove skillet from heat. Reserve 3 tablespoons drippings in skillet; mix in oil. Whisk vinegar, shallots, garlic and brown sugar in small bowl. Add to drippings in skillet. Stir over medium-low heat just until warm. Season with salt and pepper. Use warm.
