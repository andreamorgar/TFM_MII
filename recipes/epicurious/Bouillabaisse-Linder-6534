In a large heavy kettle cook leeks, celery, fennel bulbs, and onion in oil over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 10 minutes. In a very small bowl combine saffron and hot water. Add saffron mixture to vegetables with stock, wine, tomatoes, garlic, bay leaves, tomato paste, parsley, salt, pepper, and reserved fennel fronds. Bring mixture to a boil and simmer, covered, 45 minutes. Pour mixture through a large sieve into a heatproof bowl, reserving vegetables (but discarding bay leaves) for another use if desired. Return broth to kettle and bring to a simmer. Add fish and cook, covered, 10 minutes, or until opaque and cooked through. Transfer fish with a slotted spoon to a large platter and cover with foil to keep warm. To broth add lobsters and cook, covered, 12 minutes. Transfer lobsters with tongs to platter and cover with foil. To broth add mussels and clams and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until shells open, about 4 minutes. With slotted spoon transfer mussels and clams to platter, discarding any unopened ones. Pour hot broth into bowls and serve with seafood and toasts. In a large heavy kettle combine all ingredients. Bring mixture to a boil and simmer, covered, 45 minutes. Pour stock through a fine sieve into a heatproof bowl, discarding solids, and cool. Fish stock may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Makes about 8 cups.
