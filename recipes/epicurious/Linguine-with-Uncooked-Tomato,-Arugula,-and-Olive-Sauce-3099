In a large bowl stir together the garlic paste, the tomatoes, the arugula, the olives, the oil, the vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste and let the mixture marinate for 20 minutes. In a large saucepan of boiling salted water cook the linguine for 10 minutes, or until it is al dente, drain it, and while it is still hot, toss it with the sauce. Serve the pasta warm or at room temperature.
