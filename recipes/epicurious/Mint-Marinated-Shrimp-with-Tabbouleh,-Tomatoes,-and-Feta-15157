Stir bulgur, 1 1/2 cups water, 1/2 cup lemon juice, and 1/3 cup oil in large bowl. Let stand until bulgur is tender and most liquid is absorbed, about 2 hours. Meanwhile, whisk together remaining 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 2 tablespoons oil, 3 tablespoons mint, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in medium bowl. Mix in shrimp. Marinate 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Drain off any excess liquid from bulgur. Mix in tomatoes, arugula, feta, green onions, garlic, remaining 3 tablespoons mint, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Season salad to taste with pepper. Mound salad in large shallow bowl or on individual plates. Spoon shrimp and dressing over and serve. *Also called cracked wheat; available at supermarkets, specialty foods stores, and natural foods stores.
