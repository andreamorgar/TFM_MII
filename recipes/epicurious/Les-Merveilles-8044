In large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Set aside. In large bowl of electric mixer, beat together eggs, butter, orange and lemon zests, vanilla, rum, and 1/2 cup water until combined. Add flour mixture and beat just until dough comes together, adding more water if dough is not forming. Turn dough out onto well-floured surface and knead gently until smooth, about 8 turns. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate 3 hours. In 4-quart sauce pan, combine 1 cup water, sugar, and quince, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until fruit is soft and coated with syrup, about 25 minutes. (Fruit will become translucent and change color from yellow to pink.) Using slotted spoon, remove fruit and set aside to cool at room temperature. Continue to simmer syrup until pinkish-amber in color and thick enough to coat back of metal spoon. Remove from heat and cool at room temperature. In small skillet over moderately high heat, heat oil until hot but not smoking. Add pine nuts and sauté, stirring constantly, until golden, about 2 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain. On floured surface, use floured rolling pin to roll dough into 10-inch square (about 1/2-inch thick). Using pizza cutter, cut dough into 16 (2 1/2-inch) squares, then cut each square in half diagonally, making 32 triangles. In 6- to 8-inch-deep, heavy saucepan over moderate heat, heat 3 inches shortening until thermometer registers 360°F. Working in batches (return oil to 360°F between batches), fry merveilles, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Place 4 bowls on 4 slightly larger plates. Scoop 1/3 cup ricotta cheese in middle of each bowl and surround with alternating slices figs and quince. Drizzle cooled syrup over fruit and ricotta, and sprinkle with pine nuts. Just before serving, sift confectioners' sugar over merveilles and place 4 to 5 on the edge of each plate (there will be extra).
