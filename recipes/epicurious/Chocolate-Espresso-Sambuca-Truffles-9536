In a double boiler or in a metal bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water melt chocolate and butter with cream and espresso, stirring until smooth. Remove top of double boiler or bowl from heat and stir in liqueur. Cool mixture and chill, covered, at least 3 hours, or until firm. Form rounded teaspoons of mixture into balls and roll balls in cocoa powder, coating them. Truffles keep, layered between sheets of wax paper and chilled, in airtight containers 2 weeks.
