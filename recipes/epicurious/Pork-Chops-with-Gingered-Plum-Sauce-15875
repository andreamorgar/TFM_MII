Quarter and pit plums and mince garlic. Pat pork chops dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. In a 12-inch heavy skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and brown pork chops about 2 minutes on each side, transferring to a plate. Add garlic and gingerroot to skillet and sauté, stirring constantly, 30 seconds. Stir in soy sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, and anise and bring to a simmer. Return pork chops to skillet and arrange plums around them. Simmer mixture, covered, over moderately low heat 50 minutes, or until meat is very tender. Transfer chops to a platter and, if necessary, simmer sauce, uncovered, until thickened slightly. Discard star anise, if used. Pour sauce over chops and garnish with scallion and plum.
