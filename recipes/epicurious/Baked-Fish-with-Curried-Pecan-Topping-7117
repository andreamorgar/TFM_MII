Preheat oven to 350°F. Mix first 7 ingredients in 8x8x2-inch glass baking dish. Add oil; stir to blend. Bake until pecan mixture is light golden, about 8 minutes. Transfer pecan mixture to plate and cool. Increase oven temperature to 450°F. Beat egg white in medium bowl until foamy. Dip fish fillets 1 at a time into egg white, then into pecan mixture, coating both sides. Arrange fish in same baking dish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Press any excess pecan mixture atop fish fillets. Bake until fish is opaque in center, about 12 minutes and serve.
