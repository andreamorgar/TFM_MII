Preheat oven to 250°F. Melt butter in a wide 4-quart heavy pot over moderate heat, then add mushrooms, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Toss mushrooms to coat with butter, then cover surface with a round of parchment or wax paper and cook over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are tender, about 15 minutes. Transfer mushrooms with a slotted spoon to a small baking dish, reserving butter and juices in pot, and keep warm, covered, in oven. Whisk together eggs, cream, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper until smooth and add to pot, stirring to incorporate pan juices. Cook over moderately low heat, stirring slowly, until small curds form and eggs are creamy (not dry), about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in herbs. Reserve some mushrooms for garnish, if desired, and stir remaining mushrooms into eggs.
