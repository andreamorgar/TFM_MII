In a sauté pan over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add the onion and peppers and cook until the onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Add the remaining oil, then add the potatoes, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper to taste. Lower the heat and continue to cook, stirring often, until the potatoes are nicely browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve at once.
