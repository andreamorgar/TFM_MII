Put the lamb slices in a deep pan with 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, 1 teaspoon basil, and 1 teaspoon thyme, small chopped onion, carrot, 2 finely chopped cloves garlic, and enough red wine to cover. Marinate for 2 hours. Arrange one half of the lamb slices on the bottom of a terrine or casserole. The meat must be packed in to fit together tightly, so be sure select the right size casserole. Add a layer of the chopped onion, bacon or salt pork, and remaining garlic with the parsley and a little thyme and basil, all mixed together. Top with a few pieces of orange rind. Arrange rest of meat in casserole, packing it tightly on top of the layer of seasoning. Strain the marinade and add enough of the liquid to barely cover the meat. Put strips of larding pork on top, cover and bake in a 325°F oven for 2 hours. Reduce heat to 300° and cook for another 1 1/2 hours. Finally, reduce heat to 275°F and cook for 1 hour. This dish can be served either hot or cold. Serve it with boiled potatoes and a crisp green salad. With this, drink a red wine such as Château Cos d'Estournal.
