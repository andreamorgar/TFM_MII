In a bowl wash the bulgur in several changes of cold water, letting it settle to the bottom before pouring off most of the water, until the water is clear and drain it in a large fine sieve. Return the bulgur to the bowl, add enough cold water to cover it by 1 inch, and let the bulgur soak for 1 hour. While the bulgur is soaking, in a large bowl stir together the onion, the salt and the allspice and let the mixture stand for 30 minutes. Drain the bulgur in the sieve, pressing hard to extract as much water as possible, add it to the onion mixture with the herbs, the scallion, the lemon juice, the oil, the cucumber, the tomato, and salt and pepper to taste, and toss the salad well.
