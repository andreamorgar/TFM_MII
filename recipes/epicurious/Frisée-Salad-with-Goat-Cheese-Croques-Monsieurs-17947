In a salad bowl whisk together the shallot, the mustard, the vinegar, and salt to taste and let the mixture stand for 10 minutes. Add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. In a small bowl cream together the goat cheese and 1 tablespoon of the oil. Spread 4 slices of the bread with the mixture and top them with the remaining slices, pressing the sandwiches lightly. In a small non-stick skillet heat 1 1/2 tablespoons of the remaining oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking, in it sauté 2 of the sandwiches for 1 1/2 minutes on each side, or until they are golden, and transfer them to a plate. Sauté the remaining 2 sandwiches in the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in the same manner. Cut the croques-monsieurs into 1-inch squares. Add the frisée to the salad bowl, toss it to coat it with the dressing, and add the croque-monsieur squares, tossing the salad gently.
