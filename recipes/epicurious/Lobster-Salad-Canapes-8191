Plunge lobster headfirst into a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water. Cook lobster, partially covered, over moderately high heat 9 minutes from time it enters water, then transfer with tongs to sink to cool. While lobster is cooling, cut each cucumber slice with scalloped cutter (if using), discarding trimmings. Whisk together mayonnaise, lime juice (to taste), jalapeño, salt, and a pinch of pepper. When lobster is cool, remove meat from claws, joints, and tail, discarding tomalley, roe, and shells. Cut meat into 1/4-inch pieces. Add lobster, mango, celery, onion, and cilantro to dressing and toss well. Top each cucumber round with 1 rounded teaspoon lobster salad.
