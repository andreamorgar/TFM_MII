Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Cut off and peel neck of squash, then cut neck crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick rounds (reserve round portion for another use). Season both sides of slices with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook squash, in batches if necessary, until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Add water to skillet and cook squash, covered, over moderately low heat until tender, about 5 minutes. Gently transfer squash with a spatula to a 2-quart gratin or other shallow baking dish, overlapping slices if necessary, then pour any juices from pan over squash. Cook onions and garlic in remaining 2 tablespoons oil in skillet over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until soft, about 8 minutes. Stir in tomatoes with juice, oregano, allspice, and salt and pepper to taste and simmer 3 minutes. Cover squash with tomato mixture and crumble feta on top, then sprinkle with nuts. Bake gratin until heated through and cheese is softened, about 10 minutes. Serve gratin drizzled with oil.
