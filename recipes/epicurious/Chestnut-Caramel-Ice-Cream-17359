Whisk chestnut spread, 1/4 cup milk, and salt in small bowl to combine. Set aside. Combine sugar and 1/3 cup water in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides and swirling pan, about 12 minutes. Slowly and carefully add cream (mixture will bubble vigorously), then remaining 1 cup milk. Stir over low heat until any hard caramel bits dissolve and mixture is smooth. Stir in chestnut spread mixture and Armagnac. Transfer cream mixture to bowl; cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 4 hours or overnight. Process cream mixture in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer ice cream to bowl; cover tightly and freeze until firm, at least 4 hours. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Keep frozen.) Scoop into bowls. Sprinkle each with 2 tablespoons chopped chestnuts.
