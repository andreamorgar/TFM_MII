Discard small tough muscle from side of each scallop and in a food processor purée half scallops with salt. With motor running add tofu in a stream and blend until just combined. Transfer scallop mousse to a small bowl. Chop fine remaining scallops and stir into mousse with corn, bell pepper, scallion, and coriander. Put about 1 tablespoon filling in center of 1 wrapper and moisten edge of wrapper. Gather edge of wrapper up and around filling, pleating edge. Gently squeeze middle of pot sticker to form a waist, keeping filling level with top of wrapper. (Pot sticker will resemble a sack filled to top.) Make 17 more pot stickers in same manner and arrange on a tray dusted lightly with cornstarch. Pot stickers may be made up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered with plastic wrap. In a large non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and fry pot-sticker bottoms until golden, about 1 minute. Add water and steam pot stickers, covered, 3 to 4 minutes, or until filling is springy to touch. Remove lid and cook pot stickers until liquid is evaporated and bottoms are recrisped. Serve pot stickers with vinaigrette and garnish with coriander.
