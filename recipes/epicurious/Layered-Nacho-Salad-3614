Place avocados in medium bowl. Add 1/3 cup salsa and mash to chunky guacamole consistency. Season with salt and pepper. Layer half of lettuce, chicken or turkey, chips, beans, green onions, bell pepper and cheese in large bowl. Top with half of guacamole and half of remaining salsa. Repeat layering with remaining ingredients. Use additional salsa to cover top if necessary. (Can be made 3 hours ahead. Cover; chill.)
