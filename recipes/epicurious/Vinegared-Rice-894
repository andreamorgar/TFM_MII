In a large bowl cover the rice with cold water, stir the mixture, and pour off the water. Continue to wash the rice in the same manner until the water runs clear. Drain the rice well, in a heavy saucepan combine it with 1 1/2 cups water, and let the mixture stand for 30 minutes. Bring the liquid to a boil, covered, over high heat and simmer the rice, covered, over low heat for 10 minutes. Cook the rice over high heat for 1 minute and remove the pan from the heat. Let the rice stand, covered, for 15 minutes and transfer it to a ceramic of glass bowl. While the rice is cooking, in a small stainless steel or enameled saucepan combine the vinegar, the sugar, and the salt and cook the mixture over moderately low heat, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved. Let the mixture cool. Add the vinegar mixture, a little at a time, to warm the rice, stirring the mixture gently, and let the vinegared rice cool, covered.
