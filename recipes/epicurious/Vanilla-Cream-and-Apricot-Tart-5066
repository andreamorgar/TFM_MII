Coarsely chop vanilla bean in processor. Add sugar and process until vanilla bean is finely ground. Sift sugar through strainer to remove large pieces of vanilla bean. Blend sugar, cream cheese, cream, sour cream and 2 tablespoons Marsala in processor until smooth. Refrigerate while preparing crust. Preheat oven to 450°F. Roll out crust on lightly floured surface to 13-inch-diameter round. Transfer to 11-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Pierce all over with fork. Bake until golden, about 16 minutes. Cool completely on rack. Stir preserves and remaining 4 teaspoons Marsala in heavy small saucepan over medium heat until preserves melt. Brush some preserves thinly over crust. Fill with cream cheese mixture. Top with apricots. Brush apricots with remaining preserves. Refrigerate at least 1 hour. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead.)
