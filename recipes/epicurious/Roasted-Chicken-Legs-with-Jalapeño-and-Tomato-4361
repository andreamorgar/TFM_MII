Preheat oven to 450°F. In a bowl stir together oil and lime juice. Add chicken legs and toss to coat. Arrange chicken legs, skin sides up, in a roasting pan and season with salt and pepper. To oil mixture remaining in bowl add tomatoes, chilies, onion, garlic, and salt to taste and toss well. Spread vegetable mixture around chicken legs in one layer and roast in upper third of oven 30 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through. Transfer chicken to a platter and keep warm, covered with foil. To vegetables in pan add broth and boil over moderately high heat, scraping up browned bits, until sauce thickens slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve chicken with sauce and vegetables.
