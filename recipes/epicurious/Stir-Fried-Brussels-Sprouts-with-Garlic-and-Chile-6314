Blanch brussels sprouts in a large pot of boiling salted water until bright green, about 15 seconds. Drain and set aside. Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and stir until light golden brown, about 30 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a small bowl. Increase heat to high; add brussels sprouts. Stir-fry until they begin to soften, 2-3 minutes. Add oyster sauce and next 5 ingredients. Stir-fry for 30 seconds; add chicken broth. Bring to a boil; cook until liquid is reduced slightly, about 2 minutes; add more chiles, if desired. Stir in garlic.
