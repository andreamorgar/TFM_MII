Cut gingerroot into 4 pieces and smash with flat side of a knife. In a small heavy saucepan bring half-and-half and gingerroot just to a simmer over moderately low heat, about 10 minutes (do not let boil). While mixture is heating, in a bowl whisk together yolks and sugar until smooth. Add hot half-and-half mixture in a slow stream, whisking, and transfer custard to pan. Cook custard over moderately low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until a thermometer registers 170°F, about 5 minutes (do not let boil). Pour custard through a fine sieve into a clean bowl and cool. (Crème anglaise may be made 3 days ahead and chilled, covered. Bring crème anglaise to room temperature before serving.)
