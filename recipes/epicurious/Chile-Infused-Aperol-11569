Combine 6 ounces Aperol and 1 halved small red Thai bird chile (including stem and seeds) in a glass and let stand 10 minutes. Taste mixture; let stand 5 minutes longer for more heat, if desired. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a small jar. DO AHEAD: Chile-Infused Aperol can be made 3 months ahead. Strain, cover, and chill.
