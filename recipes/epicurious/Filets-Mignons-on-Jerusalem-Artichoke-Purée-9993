Peel Jerusalem artichokes and cut into 1-inch pieces. In a stainless-steel or enameled saucepan simmer artichokes in milk and water to cover by 1 inch until tender, about 20 minutes. (Milk will help prevent artichokes from discoloring). In a blender purée artichokes with cooking liquid, salt, pepper to taste, and horseradish (use caution when blending hot liquids). Keep purée warm in pan, covered. Preheat oven to 450°F. and lightly coat a non-stick skillet and shallow baking pan with cooking spray. Pat filets mignons dry and season with salt and pepper. Heat skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and brown steaks. Transfer steaks to baking pan and roast in middle of oven until a meat thermometer registers 135°F. for medium-rare, about 10 minutes. Spoon some sauce onto 6 plates and top with onions and steaks. Serve remaining sauce on side.
