1. Preheat the oven to 425°F. 2. Put the fish in a baking dish and top with the bell peppers, onion, ginger, and soy sauce. Drizzle the orange juice over the fish and sprinkle the zest evenly over it; cover the dish tightly with parchment paper. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through. 3. Using two large spatulas, transfer the fish to a serving platter, pour the juices from the baking dish over the top, and garnish with the scallions.
