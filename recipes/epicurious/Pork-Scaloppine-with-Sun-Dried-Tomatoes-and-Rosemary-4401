Cut tenderloin into 1-inch-thick pieces. Place 1 piece between 2 sheets of waxed paper. Pound pork with mallet or small heavy flat-bottomed saucepan until flattened to thickness of 1/4 inch. Repeat with remaining tenderloin. Place sun-dried tomatoes in small bowl. Add enough boiling water to cover tomatoes. Let stand until tomatoes are soft, approximately 5 minutes. Drain and slice tomatoes. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork in batches and fry until just cooked, turning once, about 4 minutes. Transfer pork to plate; cover with foil and keep warm. Add garlic to skillet and sauté 1 minute. Stir in wine and broth and simmer until reduced by 1/2, about 2 minutes. Mix in rosemary and tomatoes. Pour tomato mixture over pork and serve.
