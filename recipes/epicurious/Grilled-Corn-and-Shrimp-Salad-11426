Prepare grill and soak skewers in water 30 minutes. Shuck corn and quarter bell pepper lengthwise. Shell and devein shrimp. Holding 2 skewers parallel and slightly apart, thread 4 shrimp onto each pair of skewers (this will make shrimp easier to turn on grill). Grill corn on a lightly oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals, turning occasionally, until browned and tender, 8 to 10 minutes, and transfer to a large bowl. Grill bell pepper and scallions, turning occasionally, until browned and crisp-tender, about 5 minutes, and transfer to bowl. Grill shrimp until just cooked through, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side, and transfer to bowl. Cut kernels from cobs into another large bowl. Peel bell pepper and cut into 1/4-inch-wide strips. Thinly slice scallions. Add bell pepper, scallions, shrimp, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste to corn and toss to combine. In a small bowl whisk together vinegar, oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Arrange greens on 4 plates and top with corn mixture. Drizzle salads with vinaigrette.
