Heat large skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tortilla to skillet and heat until soft, about 1 minute per side; transfer to work surface. Repeat with second tortilla. Alternatively, open lavash on work surface. Spread half of coleslaw mixture on each tortilla or all of coleslaw on lavash, leaving 1/2-inch border at edges. Arrange beef, roasted peppers and green onions over coleslaw mixture. Starting at edge of tortillas or at 1 long side of lavash, roll up, enclosing fillings. Cut tortillas in half or lavash into 4 pieces.
