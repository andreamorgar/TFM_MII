Soak noodles in a bowl of cold water until pliable, about 15 minutes, and drain. Cut into 2-inch lengths. While noodles are soaking, stir together garlic, soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, and 1/2 cup vinegar. Add beef and marinate at room temperature, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes. Bring broth and water to a boil. Add beef and marinade and cook 2 minutes. Stir in noodles and cook until just tender, about 2 minutes. Toss pear and scallions with remaining teaspoon vinegar. Spoon noodles and broth into bowls and top with pear and scallions.
