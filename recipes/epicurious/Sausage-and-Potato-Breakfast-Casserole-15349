Mix in flour, then milk. Cook until mixture thickens and comes to boil, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Arrange potatoes in prepared dish. Top with 1/3 of green onions, 1 cup cheese, 1/3 of green onions, sausage mixture and remaining 1/4 cup cheese. Bake casserole until potatoes are tender, about 45 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining green onions and serve.
