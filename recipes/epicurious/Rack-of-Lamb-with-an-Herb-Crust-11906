Preheat the oven to 400°F. Heat the oil in a pan, and sear the lamb until golden brown. Roast in the oven for 15-20 minutes, then remove. In a food processor, blend the breadcrumbs, parsley, and egg until fine, then season. Brush mustard onto the lamb, and coat with the mixture. Place the shallots and garlic onto a sheet of aluminum foil, and sprinkle with the brown sugar and butter. Roast in the foil parcel for 15 minutes or until golden brown. In a pan, bring the port and the lamb stock to the boil, simmer until it has reduced by half, and season. Preheat the grill. Grill the lamb crust-side-up for 5 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes, and slice into cutlets. To serve, place a portion of the cutlets on each plate and arrange the shallots and garlic around. Drizzle the sauce around the plate, and serve with a sprig each of rosemary and thyme.
