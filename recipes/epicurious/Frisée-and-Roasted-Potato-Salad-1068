Preheat oven to 450°F. Toss potatoes with garlic, 2 tablespoons oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Arrange wedges in 1 layer in an oiled shallow (1-inch) baking pan. Roast in upper third of oven 15 minutes, then turn over. Roast until golden and cooked through, about 5 minutes more. Whisk together shallot, vinegar, mustard, kosher salt, and pepper to taste. Add remaining oil in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified. Toss together greens, potatoes, tomatoes, three fourths of Parmigiano Reggiano, and enough vinaigrette to coat. Sprinkle remaining Parmigiano Reggiano over salad and serve.
