Preheat oven to 350°F. Sprinkle fish on both sides with salt and pepper; place in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add leeks and garlic and sauté until leeks are tender and beginning to brown, about 6 minutes. Add tomatoes and tarragon to skillet; stir until tomatoes soften, about 2 minutes. Mix in vinegar; season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon leek mixture over fish fillets. Bake until fish fillets are just opaque in center, about 18 minutes.
