Keeping grapes on stems, poke each grape several times with a wooden pick and put in a large heatproof bowl. In a saucepan stir together remaining ingredients and bring to a boil. Pour hot syrup over grapes. Macerate grapes at room temperature, gently turning occasionally, 1 hour. Chill grapes, covered, at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.
