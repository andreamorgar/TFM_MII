Blend first 5 ingredients and 1/3 cup oil in processor until nuts are finely chopped. Season pesto with salt and pepper. Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until almost tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Add beans; cook until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions; sauté until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain pasta and beans; reserve 1 cup cooking liquid. Return pasta and beans to pot. Toss with pesto, onions, 3/4 cup cooking liquid, and cheese. Season with salt and pepper.
