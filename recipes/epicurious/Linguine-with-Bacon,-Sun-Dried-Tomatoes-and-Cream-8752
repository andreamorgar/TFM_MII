Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add bacon and cook until fat is rendered and bacon begins to color, about 6 minutes. Drain off fat. Add shallots and stir 1 minute. Add cream and bring to boil. Turn off heat and add sun-dried tomatoes. Meanwhile, cook linguine in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain well. Return linguine to pot. Add sauce and 1/4 cup Romano and stir to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Divide between plates. Sprinkle with nuts and parsley. Serve, passing additional Romano separately.
