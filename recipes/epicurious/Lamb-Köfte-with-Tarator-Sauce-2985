Soak bread in water to cover 30 minutes, then squeeze gently to remove as much water as possible. Pulse onion in a food processor until finely chopped. Add parsley and pulse to finely chop. Add lamb, bread, spices, and 1 tsp salt and pulse until combined. Divide mixture into 20 portions (about 1/4 cup each), forming each into a ball. Roll each ball into a 5-inch-long "cigar." Slide a skewer lengthwise through center of each. Prepare grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-hot charcoal (medium-high heat for gas). Oil grill rack, then grill köfte, covered only if using a gas grill, rotating a quarter turn occasionally, until just cooked through, about 5 minutes total.
