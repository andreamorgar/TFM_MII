Preheat oven to 350°F. Toast almonds on a baking sheet in middle of oven until golden, 5 to 10 minutes, then transfer to a bowl. Toast coconut on baking sheet in middle of oven, stirring occasionally, until golden, 8 to 12 minutes, then remove from oven and sprinkle almonds, chocolate, and a large pinch of salt over coconut. Let stand until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes, then toss until coconut and almonds are coated. Transfer with a rubber spatula to wax paper and cool until hardened, about 1 1/2 hours.
