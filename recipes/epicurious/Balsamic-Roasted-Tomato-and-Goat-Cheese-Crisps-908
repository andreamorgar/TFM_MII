Preheat the oven to 350°F. In an 8- inch square baking dish, toss the tomatoes with the vinegar and salt and pepper to taste until coated. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until the tomatoes are soft, shaking the pan occasionally. In a small bowl, mash the beans and oil to form a thick paste. Top each cracker with white bean paste, 2 warm tomatoes, a sprinkling of cheese, and 2 arugula leaves. Serve.
