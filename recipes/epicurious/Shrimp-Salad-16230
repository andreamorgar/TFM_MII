Cook garlic in oil in a small heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 2 minutes. Pour oil through a sieve into a large heatproof bowl and discard garlic. Cool oil, then toss with tomatoes, shallot, chile, fish sauce, and lime juice. Bring water, salt, and ginger to a boil in a large pot, then boil shrimp until just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain in a colander and discard ginger. Add shrimp to tomatoes, then add peanuts. Toss to combine and season with salt. Serve warm or at room temperature.
