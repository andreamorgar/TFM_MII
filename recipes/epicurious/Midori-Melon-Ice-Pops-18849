Blend all ingredients in a blender until smooth. Pour purée into a sieve lined with a double thickness of cheesecloth set over a bowl and let drain, undisturbed, 30 minutes. Discard solids in sieve. Pour liquids into molds and freeze at least 24 hours. Add sticks when mixture is slushy, about 1 hour.
