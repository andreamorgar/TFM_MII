1. Peel, pit and slice peaches, reserving peels and pits. Combine the peach slices, lemon juice and 1/4 cup sugar, then set aside. 2. In a saucepan, combine the milk, cream, remaining sugar, vanilla and peach peels and pits; cook, stirring, over medium heat for 10 minutes. Do not boil. Remove from heat. 3. Place yolks in a bowl and, whisking constantly, pour in 1 cup of the hot-milk mixture; continue whisking until smooth. 4. Slowly pour the egg mixture back into the hot-milk mixture in the saucepan, whisking constantly until smooth. Place the saucepan over medium heat and stir the mixture constantly until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon (6 to 8 minutes). The mixture should never boil. 5. Cool to room temperature and then strain into a bowl. 6. Puree the reserved peaches in a food processor until smooth. Stir into the milk mixture and freeze in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.
