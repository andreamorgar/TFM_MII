In a small saucepan heat milk with sugar, butter, and salt over low heat until mixture is lukewarm, or registers between 110°F. and 115°F. on a candy thermometer, and transfer to a bowl. Sprinkle yeast over milk mixture and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Whisk in egg and stir in 2 1/2 cups flour, stirring until mixture forms a dough. On a floured surface knead dough, kneading in enough of remaining 1/2 cup flour to form a soft dough, 8 to 10 minutes. Form dough into a ball and transfer to a well-buttered bowl. Turn dough to coat with butter. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Butter 32 miniature (1/8-cup) muffin tins. Turn dough out on a floured surface. Working with about one third of dough at a time, cut off pieces about the size of large marbles. Form pieces into balls and put 3 balls into each tin. Let rolls rise, covered loosely, in a warm place until almost doubled in bulk, 30 to 40 minutes. While rolls are rising, preheat oven to 400°F. Brush rolls lightly with egg wash and sprinkle with seeds. Bake rolls in middle of oven until golden, about 10 minutes. Rolls may be made 2 weeks ahead and frozen, double-wrapped in resealable plastic bags, with excess air pressed out. Reheat rolls, wrapped in foil, in middle of a preheated 350°F. oven 15 to 20 minutes, or until heated through.
