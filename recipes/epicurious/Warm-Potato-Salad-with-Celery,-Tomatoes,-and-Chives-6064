Cover potatoes with salted cold water by 1 inch in a saucepan, then simmer until just tender, about 20 minutes. While potatoes are simmering, whisk together mayonnaise, oil, vinegar, garlic, chives, and salt and pepper to taste in a large bowl. Drain potatoes in a colander and cool 5 minutes. Add to dressing along with celery and tomatoes. Toss salad gently and season with salt and pepper
