In a stainless-steel saucepan combine the wine and the sugar, bring the mixture to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved, and boil it for 1 minute. Add the prunes and the Armagnac and simmer the mixture, covered, for 15 minutes. Let the mixture cool, covered, for 15 minutes and spoon it into a 1 1/2-quart ceramic or glass container. Let the mixture cool completely, covered. The prunes keep, covered and chilled, for 3 months.
