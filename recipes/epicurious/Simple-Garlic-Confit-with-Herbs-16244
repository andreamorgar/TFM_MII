Peel garlic cloves and place in a medium heavy saucepan. Stir in thyme and oil. Cover and cook over very low heat (you want the garlic to gently poach, not deep fry!), about 30 minutes. Small bubbles will rise from the garlic, but don't let the oil simmer. The oil temperature should not go above 200°F. To test for doneness, spear a clove with a fork. If it's very soft, turn off heat; if not, poach 10–15 minutes more. Remove pan from heat, keep covered, and let cool to room temperature. Using a clean spoon, divide garlic and herbs among resealable glass jars. Fill jars with cooking oil, seal, and chill. Garlic confit can be chilled for up to 4 months.
