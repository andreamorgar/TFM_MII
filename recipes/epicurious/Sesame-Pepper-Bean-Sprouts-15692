Mix 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper in a small bowl; set aside. Cook 6 cups mung bean sprouts (about 12 ounces) in a large pot of boiling salted water until soft but not mushy, 3-4 minutes. Drain well. Transfer to a medium bowl. Add 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil; toss to coat. Season with sesame mixture and gochugaru (coarse Korean red pepper powder). (Serve remaining sesame mixture with Bibimbap .)
