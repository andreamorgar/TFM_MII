Preheat oven to 300°F. Using vegetable peeler, remove four 4x1-inch strips from rind of 1 orange. Grate peel from 2 more oranges. Cut 4 oranges in half; squeeze out 1 1/4 cups juice. Whisk grated orange peel, orange juice, hoisin sauce, tomato paste, and garlic in large bowl to blend. Stir in ginger. Sprinkle ribs with salt and pepper. Place in heavy large ovenproof pot. Pour orange-ginger mixture over ribs. Stir in orange strips and apricots. Cover and bake 2 hours. Stir rib mixture; reduce oven temperature to 250°F. Continue cooking ribs, covered, until meat is very tender, about 1 hour longer. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool. Refrigerate uncovered until cold, then cover and refrigerate. Spoon off solidified fat, then rewarm ribs over medium heat before serving.) Using slotted spoon, transfer ribs and apricots to large platter. Spoon off any fat from sauce in pot. Pour sauce over ribs. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.
