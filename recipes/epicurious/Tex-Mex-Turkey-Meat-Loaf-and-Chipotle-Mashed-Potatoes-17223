Preheat oven to 375°F. Chop onion, bell pepper, and cilantro and mince garlic, transferring all to a large bowl. Into a blender tear 2 bread slices and grind into fine crumbs. Add crumbs to onion mixture. Make more bread crumbs in same manner with remaining 2 bread slices and add to onion mixture. Add ‚ cup chili sauce and all remaining ingredients and with your hands mix until just combined (do not overmix). Transfer mixture to an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2 1/2-inch glass loaf pan, pressing down on mixture to eliminate any air pockets (mixture will completely fill pan), and spread remaining 6 tablespoons chili sauce evenly over top. Line a shallow baking pan with foil and put loaf pan in baking pan (to catch any drippings). Bake meat loaf, uncovered, in middle of oven 1 1/2 hours, or until a meat thermometer inserted 2 inches into middle of loaf registers 170°F. Transfer meat loaf in pan to a rack and let stand, loosely covered with foil, 20 minutes before slicing. Meat loaf may be made 1 day ahead and cooled, uncovered, before being chilled, covered. If desired, reheat meat loaf, covered, in a 350°F. oven about 20 minutes. Cut meat loaf into 6 or 12 slices and serve with potatoes.
