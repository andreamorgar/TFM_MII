Pat steaks dry and cut 3 shallow slits across center cartilage in each steak (to prevent curling). Season with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper (total). Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Sear steaks, turning once, 5 to 9 minutes total for medium-rare. Meanwhile, drop garlic into a food processor with motor running. Add beans, broth, remaining tablespoon oil, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and pulse until smooth. Transfer steaks to a plate and reduce skillet heat to medium. Add tomato paste and 1 teaspoon rosemary and cook, stirring, 30 seconds. Add wine and boil, scraping up brown bits, 30 seconds. Stir in purée and 1 tablespoon olives and cook, stirring, until heated through, about 3 minutes. Stir in meat juices from plate and season with salt and pepper. Serve steaks with purée. Top with remaining rosemary, olives, and a drizzle of oil.
