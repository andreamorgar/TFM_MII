Preheat broiler. On a plate, stir together oregano, 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 1 teaspoon oil. Dip both sides of lamb chops in mixture to coat and put on rack of a broiling pan, seasoning both sides of chops with salt and pepper. In a bowl, stir together olives, tomato, onion, parsley, zest, remaining teaspoon lemon juice, remaining teaspoon oil and salt and pepper to taste. Broil lamb chops 2 inches from heat 4 to 5 minutes on each side for medium-rare meat. Spoon olive salsa over lamb chops. In a saucepan combine potatoes with salted water to cover by 1 inch and simmer until just tender, 8 to 10 minutes. In a colander, rinse potatoes under cold water to stop cooking and drain well. In a bowl, stir together yogurt, garlic paste, and mint. Add cucumbers and potatoes to yogurt mixture with salt and pepper to taste and toss well.
