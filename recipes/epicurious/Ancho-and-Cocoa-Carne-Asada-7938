Preheat oven to 350°F. Stir together ancho powder, cocoa, and cinnamon. Pat steak dry and season with 3/4 teaspoon salt, then coat with spice mixture. Heat oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then cook steak, turning once, 8 to 9 minutes for medium-rare. While steak cooks, wrap tortillas in foil and warm in oven. Let steak rest 5 minutes on a cutting board, then thinly slice across the grain at an angle. Serve steak with warm tortillas and coleslaw mix.
