In bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with dough hook stir together water, yeast, and sugar and let stand 5 minutes, or until foamy. Stir in 2 1/4 cups flour, salt, pepper, oil, and olives and knead dough, scraping down dough hook occasionally and adding enough of remaining 1/4 cup flour to form a soft, slightly sticky dough, about 3 minutes. Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat, and let rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes. Dough may be made 1 day ahead and chilled in bowl, covered with plastic wrap.
