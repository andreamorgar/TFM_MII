Preheat oven to 375°F with rack in middle. Whisk together flour, baking powder, paprika, and salt in a large bowl. Add butter and blend with your fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal with some pea-size butter lumps. Add remaining ingredients and stir just until a dough forms. With floured hands, divide dough into 8 portions and gently form into 2-inch-high biscuits. Arrange 2 inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake until bottoms are golden and biscuits are cooked through, about 30 minutes. Transfer to a rack and cool completely.
