Preheat oven to 375°F. Whisk flour, cocoa, sugar, and salt in large bowl to blend. Add butter; rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal. Whisk yolks in small bowl to blend; add to flour mixture. Stir until moist clumps form. Gather dough into ball; press over bottom and up sides of 11-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Bake crust until set, about 15 minutes. Cool while preparing filling. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F. Blend corn syrup, sugar, and butter in medium bowl. Whisk in eggs, vanilla, and salt. Stir in 1/2 cup chocolate chips, 3/4 cup coconut, and pecans. Pour filling into prepared crust. Bake tart until filling is set and golden brown on top, about 40 minutes. Place tart on rack. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips evenly around edge of warm tart. Let stand just until chips soften, about 5 minutes. Using small spatula, spread chocolate to form 1-inch border around edge of tart. Sprinkle chocolate border with remaining 3 tablespoons coconut. Cool completely. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover loosely with foil; let stand at room temperature.)
