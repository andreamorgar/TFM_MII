1. String cubes of meat on skewers, brush well with olive oil and broil, turning often. If you crowd the cubes together, you will have rare juicy meat. If the cubes are placed further apart, you will have medium well done meat. (Remember, pork must be well done.) Salt and pepper the kebabs to taste as they cook. Serve these plain kebabs with rice mixed with pistachio nuts and a plate of crisp French fried onion rings. 2. Marinate meat cubes in a mixture of olive oil, lemon juice and a pinch of dried thyme. Let the meat soak for 2 hours or more. Alternate the cubes on skewers with tiny tomatoes, tiny whole onions that have been parboiled for a few minutes and strips of green pepper. Broil as above, brushing with the marinade during the cooking. 3. Soak the meat in a marinade of olive oil, lemon juice, oregano and plenty of coarse black pepper. Proceed as above. 4. Alternate lamb cubes with pieces of sweetbread and marinate in olive oil, lemon juice and several crushed bay leaves. Proceed as above. 5. Alternate cubes of lamb or beef with squares of eggplant. Marinate in olive oil, lemon juice, grated garlic and black pepper. Broil as above.
