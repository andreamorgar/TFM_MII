Preheat oven to 400° F. Halve tomatoes lengthwise and scoop out seeds with a small spoon. Arrange tomatoes in one layer, cut sides up, on a non-stick or lightly oiled jelly-roll pan. In a small food processor blend basil, garlic, oil, salt, and pepper until mixture forms a paste and spread about 1/2 teaspoon in each tomato half. Bake tomatoes 30 to 40 minutes, or until tender and juicy but intact, and cool slightly before serving.
