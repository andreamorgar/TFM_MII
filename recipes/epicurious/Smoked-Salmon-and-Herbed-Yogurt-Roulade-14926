Make the egg sponge and let it cool to room temperature, covered with a sheet of wax paper. In a bowl combine well the yogurt, the parsley, the scallion greens, and the capers. Spread the egg sponge evenly with the yogurt mixture, leaving a 1/2 inch border on all 4 sides, arrange the salmon strips in 6 lengthwise rows about 2 inches apart on the yogurt mixture, and starting with a long side roll up the egg sponge jelly-roll fashion. Trim the ends diagonally and slice the roulade.
