Char peppers over gas flame, in broiler, or on grill until charred on all sides. Enclose in paper bag 10 minutes. Peel and seed peppers; slice into thin strips. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and sauté until golden, about 15 minutes. Mix in flour; sauté 2 minutes. Add bell peppers, wine, vinegar, and capers; cook 1 minute. Add broth. Increase heat; boil until sauce thickens enough to coat spoon, about 4 minutes. Mix in parsley. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill. Rewarm before using.) Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Brush pork on all sides with remaining 4 teaspoons oil. Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper. Grill until thermometer inserted into center of pork registers 145°F, about 10 minutes per side. Transfer chops to platter. Spoon sauce over.
