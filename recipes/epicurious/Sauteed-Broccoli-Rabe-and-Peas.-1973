Trim stem ends from broccoli rabe and discard. Cut remainder crosswise into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Cook broccoli rabe and peas in a 4- to 6-quart pot of boiling salted water until broccoli rabe is wilted and stems are crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain well in a colander. Heat oil with garlic in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat, turning garlic frequently, until garlic is golden, 1 to 2 minutes, then discard garlic. Add broccoli rabe, peas, salt, and pepper to skillet and sauté, stirring, until well coated with garlic oil, about 2 minutes.
