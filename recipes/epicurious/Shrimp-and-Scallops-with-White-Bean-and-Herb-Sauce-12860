In a small saucepan cook the onion and the garlic in 1 tablespoon of the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until the onion is soft, add the wine, and simmer the mixture until the wine is reduced by half. Add the parsley, the basil, 1/2 cup of the beans, and the clam juice, simmer the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute, and in a blender purée it. In the saucepan stir together the puré, the remaining 1/2 cup beans, and salt and pepper to taste and simmer the mixture for 2 minutes. In a skillet, preferably non-stick, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it sauté the shrimp, seasoned with salt and pepper, for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on each side, or until they are cooked through. Transfer the shrimp with a slotted spoon to a plate and keep them warm. To the skillet add the scallops and sauté them, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until they are cooked through. Divide the bean sauce between 2 shallow bowls and arrange the shellfish over it.
