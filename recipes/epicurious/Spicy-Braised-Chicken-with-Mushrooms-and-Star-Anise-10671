Heat peanut oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add chicken; sauté until brown, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to bowl. Add mushrooms, 1 1/2 cups green onions, garlic and ginger to pot. Sauté until mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes. Return chicken to pot. Add chicken broth, hoisin sauce and star anise. Bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove chicken from pot; cool slightly. Remove skin and bones from chicken and discard. Cut meat crosswise into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Meanwhile, boil mixture in pot until reduced to 2 1/2 cups, about 20 minutes. Stir in cabbage and chili sauce. Boil until cabbage is tender, about 4 minutes. Return chicken to pot; simmer until heated through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to bowl. Discard star anise. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup green onions.
