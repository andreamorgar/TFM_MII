Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add onions and sauté until beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. Add turkey, chili powder, and pumpkin pie spice. Sauté 3 minutes. Add tomatoes with juices, 1 cup water, raisins, and vinegar. Increase heat to high and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until flavors blend, about 15 minutes. Uncover and simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and serve.
