Grate 1 teaspoon zest from 1 orange and reserve. Cut peel, including white pith, from oranges with a sharp knife. Cut segments free from membranes into a bowl. Squeeze 1 tablespoon juice from membranes into a large bowl and whisk together with reserved zest, vinegar, oil, mustard, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper until emulsified. Add escarole, endive, and orange segments to vinaigrette and gently toss.
