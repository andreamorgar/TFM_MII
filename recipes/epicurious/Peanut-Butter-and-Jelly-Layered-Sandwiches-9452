Take 1 slice of white bread, spread it with peanut butter, and top with another slice of bread. Spread the top of that slice with grape or raspberry-and-apple jelly. Place another slice of bread on top. Using a serrated knife, cut off the crusts and slice into rectangles, about 1 1/2 inches wide by 3 inches long. Repeat with another 9 slices of bread.
