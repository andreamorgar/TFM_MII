Preheat broiler. Cut four 6x8-inch pieces of foil. Place 1 fish fillet in center of each piece of foil. Fold up foil to form rectangle with 3/4-inch-high sides. Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper. Place packets on small baking sheet. Combine butter, 1 tablespoon basil, Old Bay seasoning, lemon juice, and garlic in small bowl. Using wooden spoon, mix until well combined. Spread mixture over fish in foil. Broil fish (do not turn fish) until opaque in center, about 6 minutes. Transfer fish in foil to 4 plates. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon basil. Serve immediately.
