In wide, deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan over moderate heat, bring cream to simmer. Cook, uncovered and without stirring, until thickened enough to coat back of wooden spoon, about 5 minutes. Stir in spinach and cook, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes. Transfer to bowl and cool slightly. Stir in sour cream and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Serve warm.
