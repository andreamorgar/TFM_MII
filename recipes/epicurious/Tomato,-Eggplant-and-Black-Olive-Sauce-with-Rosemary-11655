Toss eggplant with 1 tablespoon salt in large colander. Set colander over bowl. Let stand 30 minutes to allow excess liquid to drain from eggplant. Using paper towels, pat eggplant dry. Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add eggplant, onions and garlic. Cook until eggplant is almost tender and beginning to brown, stirring often, about 15 minutes. Add rosemary; cook 1 minute. Add tomatoes with juices and tomato paste. Simmer uncovered until flavors blend and sauce thickens slightly, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Mix in olives and simmer 5 minutes longer. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cool. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm before serving.)
