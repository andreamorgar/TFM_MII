Make gashes in the tuna and insert garlic slices and anchovy fillets. Rub well with oil and basil and let it stand 2 hours in the refrigerator. Sear the tuna in olive oil. Add the onions, tomatoes, peppers, seasonings and wine. Cover and braise the fish 1 1/2 hours. Add olives to the sauce and serve hot. Or you may remove the fish to a serving dish, reduce the sauce and pour it around the fish. Cool and chill. Cut the fish in paper-thin slices and serve with the reduced sauce.
