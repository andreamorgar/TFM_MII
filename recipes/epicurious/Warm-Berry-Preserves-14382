Mix all frozen berries, jelly, and sugar in large nonstick skillet. Let stand until berries thaw and mixture is juicy, stirring occasionally and breaking strawberries into smaller pieces with spoon, about 2 hours. Boil until mixture thickens but is still chunky, stirring frequently, about 7 minutes. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm over medium heat, stirring frequently.)
