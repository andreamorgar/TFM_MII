Pour 1/4 cup water into small bowl; sprinkle gelatin over. Let stand 10 minutes. Bring cream and sugar to simmer in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat. Add gelatin mixture and whisk until dissolved. Whisk in yogurt and vanilla. Divide mixture among eight 3/4-cup custard cups. Cover and chill overnight. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Keep refrigerated.) Cut around edges of each panna cotta to loosen. Set each cup in shallow bowl of hot water for 10 seconds. Immediately invert onto plate. Top with compote.
