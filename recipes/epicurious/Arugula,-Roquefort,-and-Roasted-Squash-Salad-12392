Preheat oven to 350°F. Cut squash into 2-inch-long pieces, about 1/4 inch thick. Rinse squash seeds and pat dry. Toss together seeds, brown sugar, salt, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon butter. Toast seeds in 1 layer in a nonstick shallow baking pan in middle of oven until golden, about 10 minutes, then cool. Toss squash with remaining tablespoon butter and salt and pepper to taste in baking pan and roast squash, covered with foil, until just tender, about 20 minutes. Whisk together oil, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste in a large bowl. Crumble cheese into bowl, then add arugula. Gently toss in warm squash and sprinkle with toasted seeds.
