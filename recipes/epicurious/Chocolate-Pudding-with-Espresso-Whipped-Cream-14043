Whisk 1/4 cup sugar, cornstarch, and 1 tablespoon instant espresso powder in heavy medium saucepan to blend. Gradually whisk in milk. Whisk over medium heat until mixture boils and thickens, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk in chocolate chips, butter, and vanilla extract until smooth. Divide mixture among 6 small ramekins or glasses. Cover and chill pudding until cold, about 2 hours. Using electric mixer, beat cream, remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, and 1 teaspoon espresso powder in medium bowl until peaks form. Top each chocolate pudding with dollop of espresso cream.
