Cook beans in a large saucepan of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain in a colander and transfer to a bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking. Drain beans well and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook shallots, stirring, until just softened. Add garlic and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add bell peppers and chile and sauté over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until peppers are softened, about 3 minutes. Add vinegar and sugar and cook, stirring, until liquid is evaporated, about 2 minutes. Cool relish and season with salt and pepper. Serve beans topped with relish.
