Heat heavy skillet over moderate heat hot and toast chilies, 1 at a time, pressing down with tongs, a few seconds on each side to make more pliable. Wearing rubber gloves, seed and devein chilies and coarsely chop. In a small saucepan bring chilies and 3/4 cup milk just to a simmer and in a blender purée until smooth (use caution when blending hot liquids). Stir mixture into potatoes, adding more milk if necessary to make creamy.
