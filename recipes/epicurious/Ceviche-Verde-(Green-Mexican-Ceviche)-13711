Place the mahi mahi in a stainless-steel or nonreactive bowl. Season with salt and let stand 10 minutes, then add the lime juice and toss gently. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add the tomatillos, olives, red onion, jalapeño, avocado, cilantro, and olive oil and toss gently to combine. Season to taste with salt and serve immediately in individual glass bowls or martini glasses, accompanied by tortilla chips or crackers.
