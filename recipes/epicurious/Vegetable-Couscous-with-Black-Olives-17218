In a small saucepan bring water, salt, and 1 tablespoon oil to a boil and stir in couscous. Remove pan from heat and let couscous stand, covered, 5 minutes. While couscous is standing, in a skillet sauté onion, garlic, tomato, and zucchini with salt to taste in remaining tablespoon oil over moderately high heat, stirring, until vegetables are tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in olives, parsley, and pepper and remove skillet from heat. Fluff couscous with a fork and stir into vegetables.
