In a large bowl combine the watermelon, the cantaloupe, the honeydew, the plums, the nectarines, and the grapes. In a small bowl stir together the sugar, the salt, and the lime juice until the sugar and salt are dissolved, drizzle the syrup over the fruit, and toss the mixture gently until it is combined well. Chill the compote, covered, stirring gently once or twice, overnight.
