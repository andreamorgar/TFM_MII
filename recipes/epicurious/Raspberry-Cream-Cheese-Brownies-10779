Preheat oven to 350° with rack in upper third. Grease an 8" x 8" pan with butter, line with parchment paper, and grease and flour parchment paper. Put chocolate and 4 Tbsp butter in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of 2" simmering water. Melt, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; let cool slightly. In a small bowl, beat 2 eggs. Whisk eggs into chocolate mixture. Add 3/4 cup sugar and beat until combined. Add 1/2 cup flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir well. Stir in 1 tsp vanilla. Spread batter in prepared pan. For the cream cheese layer: In a medium bowl, stir together cream cheese and remaining 2 tbsp butter until smooth and thoroughly combined. Add remaining 2 tbsp sugar, remaining egg, and jam and mix well. Stir in remaining 1 tbsp flour and remaining 1/2 tsp vanilla. Dollop mixture onto batter in pan. Use a butter knife to swirl cream cheese mixture into brownies. Press fresh raspberries into the top. Bake until a wooden pick inserted into center comes out with only a few moist crumbs, 35-40 minutes (check after 30 minutes). Let cool completely before slicing and serving. The brownies will keep, wrapped individually and stored in the refrigerator, up to 4 days.
