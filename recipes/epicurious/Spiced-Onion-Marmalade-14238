Heat oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and garlic; sauté until onions just begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Add vinegar and sugar and cook 5 minutes, stirring often. Stir in tomato paste, ginger, cloves and nutmeg. Reduce heat to low and simmer until marmalade is thick, stirring often, about 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 5 days ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm before serving.)
