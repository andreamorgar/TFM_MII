Quarter medium tomatoes and chop celery. In a food processor purée quartered tomatoes until smooth and transfer to a heavy saucepan. Add celery, basil, salt, and sugar and simmer, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Force mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing hard on solids. Have ready a large bowl of ice and cold water. In a small bowl sprinkle gelatin over water and let soften 1 minute. Add gelatin mixture to hot tomato mixture, stirring until gelatin is dissolved. Stir in horseradish juice, Worcestershire sauce, and 1 tablespoon vinegar. Set bowl in bowl of ice water and stir until cool. Divide tomato mixture among four 1/2-cup molds or ramekins. Chill aspics, loosely covered, until firm, at least 4 hours, and up to 2 days. In a small bowl whisk together oil, remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. Dip bottom of 1 mold or ramekin into a bowl of hot water 3 seconds and run a thin knife around edge. Invert a plate over mold or ramekin and invert aspic onto plate. Unmold remaining aspics, 1 at a time, in same manner. Surround aspics with cherry or currant tomatoes and drizzle tomatoes with vinaigrette. Garnish tomatoes with basil.
