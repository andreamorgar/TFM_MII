Position rack in lowest third of oven and preheat to 400°F. Stir first 5 ingredients in large bowl. Mix in apples, dried cherries and preserves. Roll out 1 dough disk on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round. Transfer dough to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Brush inside and top edge of crust with glaze. Spoon filling into crust. Roll out second dough disk on floured surface to 13-inch round. Cut out small hole from center. Arrange dough over filling. Seal top crust to bottom crust at edge. Trim double overhang to 3/4 inch. Fold under, crimp edge. Brush crust (except edge) with glaze. Place pie on baking sheet. Bake until apples are tender; cover crust with foil if browning too quickly, about 1 hour 15 minutes.
