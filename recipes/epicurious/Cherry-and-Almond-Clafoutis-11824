Whisk eggs, vanilla, and remaining 1/2 cup sugar in medium bowl until well blended. Cook butter in heavy small saucepan over medium-low heat until butter begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Add butter to egg mixture and whisk to blend. Whisk in milk. Finely grind almonds, flour, and salt in processor. Stir nut mixture into custard. Pour custard over cherries, dividing equally.
