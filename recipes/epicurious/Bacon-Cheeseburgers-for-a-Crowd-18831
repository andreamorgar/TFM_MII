Grilling Method: Direct/Medium Heat Mix the ground chuck and the ground sirloin together with a fork or with your hands. Season it lightly with salt and pepper, and mix just to combine. You do not want to over-mix the meat. Gently shape the ground meat into six burgers of equal size and thickness (about 3/4-inch-thick). Brush both sides of the burgers with oil and season lightly with salt and pepper. Place burgers on cooking grate and grill until meat is to the desired level of doneness. The USDA recommends cooking all ground meat until no longer pink, about 10 to 12 minutes, turning once halfway through cooking time. Top each burger with a slice of cheese during the last couple of minutes so the cheese will melt. Remove from grill and top each burger with 2 pieces of bacon. Let the burgers rest 2 to 3 minutes to reabsorb the juices. Serve hot on the buns with lettuce, tomato, and the traditional burger condiments (mayo, mustard, ketchup) if desired.
