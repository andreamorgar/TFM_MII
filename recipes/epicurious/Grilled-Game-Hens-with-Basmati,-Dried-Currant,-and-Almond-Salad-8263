Mix 3 tablespoons oil, 2 teaspoons chili powder, and next 5 ingredients in small bowl until paste forms. Spread paste all over hens. Let marinate 30 minutes at room temperature. Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Grill hens until cooked through, turning occasionally, about 35 minutes. Transfer to platter and cool. (Can be made 6 hours ahead; cover and refrigerate.) Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add rice and stir 3 minutes. Add broth and currants; bring to boil. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer until liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 5 minutes. Place arugula in large bowl. Top with hot rice; toss to wilt arugula. Cool. Whisk remaining 4 tablespoons oil, 1/2 teaspoon chili powder, and vinegar in small bowl; pour over rice, add almonds, and toss.
