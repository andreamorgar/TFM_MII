Toss veal with flour in medium bowl; shake off excess. Sprinkle veal with salt and pepper. Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add garlic; sauté 1 minute. Discard garlic. Add butter to same pot and let melt. Working in batches, add veal to pot and sauté until brown, about 6 minutes per batch. Using slotted spoon, transfer veal to bowl. Add wine, tomatoes with juices and sage to pot, breaking up tomatoes with back of spoon and scraping up any browned bits. Return veal and any accumulated juices to pot; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer 30 minutes. Add bell peppers to stew; cover and simmer until veal and peppers are very tender, stirring frequently, about 50 minutes. Stir in capers. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool slightly. Refrigerate until cold, then cover and keep chilled. Before serving, rewarm over medium heat, stirring often.)
