In a large non-stick skillet cook garlic, green bell pepper, and onion in vegetable oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until onion is translucent. Remove skillet from heat. In a food processor blend beans, lime juice, coriander sprigs, spices, and water until smooth, adding up to 2 tablespoons more water if necessary to reach desired consistency. Add onion mixture and blend until smooth. Chill dip, covered, at least 3 hours and up to 1 day. Serve dip with baked tortilla chips or crudités.
