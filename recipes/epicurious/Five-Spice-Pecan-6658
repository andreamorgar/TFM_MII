Heat oven to 350°. In a medium saucepan, warm 4 teaspoons vegetable oil over medium-low heat. Add 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon dark brown sugar, 4 teaspoons water, 1 1/2 teaspoons five-spice powder, 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin and 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper; stir until sugar dissolves and mixture bubbles. Add 2 cups pecan halves; cook, stirring, until pecans are thickly coated, about 3 minutes. Spread evenly on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper; sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt. Bake until fragrant and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool completely.
