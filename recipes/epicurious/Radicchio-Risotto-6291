Bring 3 1/2 cups broth to simmer in medium saucepan. Reduce heat to low; keep broth warm. Heat oil in large saucepan over medium-high. Add shallots; sauté until golden, about 3 minutes. Add radicchio; sauté until wilted, about 2 minutes. Add rice; stir 1 minute. Add wine; stir until liquid is absorbed, about 4 minutes. Mix in 1 cup broth. Reduce heat to medium; cook until liquid is absorbed, stirring often. Continue cooking until rice is tender but still slightly firm in center and mixture is creamy, adding broth 1/2 cup at a time and stirring often, about 25 minutes. Remove from heat. Add cheese and butter to risotto; stir until melted. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon into bowls and serve.
