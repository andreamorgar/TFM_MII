In an 8-quart kettle bring 7 quarts of salted water to a boil for pasta. Remove tough muscle from side of each scallop if necessary. In a small heavy saucepan simmer wine, vinegar, shallot, garlic, and rosemary until reduced to about 2 tablespoons. Add cream and simmer until liquid is reduced by about half. Add butter all at once and cook over moderately low heat, swirling pan constantly, just until creamy and butter is incorporated. (Sauce must not get hot enough to liquify. It should be the consistency of hollandaise.) Remove pan from heat and stir in lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste. Pat scallops dry and season with salt and pepper. In a 12-inch heavy skillet heat 1 tablespoon oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Arrange half of scallops, without crowding, in skillet and cook, undisturbed, 1 to 2 minutes, or until undersides are golden brown. Turn scallops over and cook, undisturbed, 1 to 2 minutes, or until undersides are golden brown. Transfer scallops to a bowl and keep warm. Cook remaining scallops in remaining oil in the same manner. Cook pasta in boiling water until al dente (about 30 seconds for fresh, longer for dried) and drain in a colander. Transfer pasta to a heated bowl and pour sauce through a fine sieve onto pasta. Add any liquid accumulated in bowl of scallops and toss. Divide pasta among 6 heated plates. Arrange scallops on top of pasta and garnish with herbs.
