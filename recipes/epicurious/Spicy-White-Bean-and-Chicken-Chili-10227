Soak beans overnight in enough cold water to cover. Drain. Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and sauté until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in cumin and oregano and cook 1 minute. Mix in beans and chilies, then chicken broth and water. Simmer until beans are very tender and chili is creamy, about 1 hour 45 minutes or less.(Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill. Return to simmer before continuing.) Add chicken to chili and stir until chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Ladle chili into bowls. Garnish with yogurt, cilantro and minced chilies and serve immediately.
