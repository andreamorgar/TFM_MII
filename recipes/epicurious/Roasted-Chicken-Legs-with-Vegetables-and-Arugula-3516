Preheat oven to 450°F. Cut chicken legs into thighs and drumsticks and pat dry. Halve potatoes. Cut bell pepper into 1/2-inch-wide strips and onion into 1/2-inch-thick wedges. In a large flameproof roasting pan toss chicken, potatoes, bell pepper, and onion with oil, thyme, and salt and pepper to taste until coated and arrange in one layer, chicken skin side up. Roast chicken and vegetables 30 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and golden. While chicken and vegetables are roasting, discard any coarse stems from arugula and put arugula in a large bowl. With tongs transfer chicken and vegetables to bowl with arugula. Add wine to pan and deglaze over moderately high heat, stirring and scraping up brown bits, 1 minute. Pour sauce over chicken and vegetables, tossing, and divide between 2 plates.
