Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) and preheat broiler. Place endive in single layer on baking sheet. Brush endive with 4 tablespoons oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill until crisp-tender, about 1 minute per side. Return to baking sheet. Sprinkle with cheese. Broil until cheese melts and bubbles, about 2 minutes. Transfer to platter. Drizzle with 1/2 tablespoon oil and vinegar. Top with parsley.
