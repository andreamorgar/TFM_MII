Pierce each yam all over with fork. Working in 2 batches, cook yams in microwave 15 minutes. Turn yams over; cook until tender, about 12 minutes longer. Cut yams in half; scoop pulp into bowl. Add 3/4 cup marshmallow creme, butter, and syrup; mash until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Whisk in eggs. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill.) Preheat oven to 350°F. Cut thin slice from top and bottom of each orange to make flat surfaces. Cut oranges in half. Scoop out pulp; reserve for another use. Place orange cups on 2 baking sheets. Divide yam mixture equally among cups. Top each with dollop of marshmallow creme and 2 pecan halves. Bake until beginning to brown, about 30 minutes.
