Preheat oven to 350°F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk egg, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 2 tablespoons melted butter, honey, and 1 teaspoon orange peel in medium bowl. Set aside 1 tablespoon nuts for garnish. Add remaining nuts and all dried fruit to bowl with egg mixture; toss filling to coat. Unroll crust onto prepared sheet. Spoon filling into center of crust; spread out in even layer, leaving 1 1/2- to 2-inch border. Fold crust edges over filling, pleating occasionally. Brush crust with remaining 1/2 tablespoon melted butter. Finely chop reserved 1 tablespoon nuts. Mix chopped nuts and remaining 1/2 tablespoon brown sugar in small bowl. Sprinkle over crust. Bake crostata until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbling in center, about 40 minutes. Stir yogurt and remaining 3/4 teaspoon orange peel in small bowl. Serve crostata warm or at room temperature with orange-flavored yogurt.
