Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 12-inch round, then fit into a 9-inch pie plate. Trim and crimp edge. Whisk together corn syrup, sugar, eggs, flour, butter, vanilla, and salt until combined. Stir in melted chocolate and pecans and pour into pie shell. If dulce de leche is very thick, thin with 2 to 3 teaspoon water. Pour dulce de leche over top of pie and swirl with a fork (swirl will not be visible in baked pie). Arrange whole pecans on top. Bake until top is puffed but slightly wobbly in center, about 50 minutes. Cool to room temperature, at least 2 hours.◊
