Chop fish bones and trimmings and slice onion. In a well-buttered heavy saucepan cook fish bones and trimmings with onion, parsley, lemon juice, and salt, covered, over moderate heat 5 minutes. Add water and wine and bring to a boil, skimming froth. Simmer stock 20 minutes and pour through a fine sieve into a heat proof bowl. Stock may be made 3 days ahead and cooled, uncovered, before being chilled, covered. Stock keeps, frozen, 3 months.
