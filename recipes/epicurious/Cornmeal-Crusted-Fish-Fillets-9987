Combine first 4 ingredients in a shallow bowl. Put egg whites in another shallow bowl. Dip each fish fillet in cornmeal mixture, then in egg whites, then again in cornmeal mixture. Place fillets on a plate; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 10 minutes. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet. Add fillets and cook over medium-high heat, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve with lemon wedges.
