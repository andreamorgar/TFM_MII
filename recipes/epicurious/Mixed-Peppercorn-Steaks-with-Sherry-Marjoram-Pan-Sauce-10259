Place ground pepper on plate. Dredge steaks in pepper, turning to coat evenly. Sprinkle steaks on both sides with salt. Heat olive oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add steaks and cook to desired doneness, about 2 1/2 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to plate; tent with foil to keep warm while making pan sauce. Add shallots to skillet; sauté over medium-high heat 2 minutes. Add broth and Sherry; boil until sauce is slightly reduced, stirring to scrape up browned bits, about 4 minutes. Stir in marjoram. Remove skillet from heat; stir in vinegar. Add butter 1 piece at a time, stirring until melted. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over steaks and serve.
