Preheat oven to 400°F. Place chicken wings on heavy large baking sheet. Roast until brown, about 1 hour. Add celery, carrots and onions to chicken wings and roast until vegetables begin to brown, about 1 hour. Transfer chicken wings and vegetables to large pot. Add 4 quarts water, bay leaves, herb sprigs and peppercorns and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until liquid is reduced to 4 cups, about 6 hours. Strain into medium saucepan. Continue simmering stock until reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 40 minutes. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.)
