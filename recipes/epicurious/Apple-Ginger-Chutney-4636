In a large saucepan combine the apples, the onion, the vinegar, the brown sugar, the raisins, the gingerroot, the bell pepper, the mustard, the salt, and the red pepper flakes, bring the mixture to a boil, stirring, and cook it over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, for 40 minutes, or until it is thickened. Spoon the chutney into glass jars with tight-fitting lids. The chutney keeps, covered and chilled, for 2 weeks.
