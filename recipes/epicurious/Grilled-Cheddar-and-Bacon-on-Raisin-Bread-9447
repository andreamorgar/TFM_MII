On a large sheet of wax paper butter one side of each bread slice and turn slices over. Arrange Cheddar on unbuttered sides of bread, covering bread evenly, and top 4 cheese-lined slices with bacon. Flip remaining cheese-topped bread onto bacon. Heat a non-stick skillet over moderate heat until hot and cook sandwiches in batches, pressing lightly with a metal spatula, until undersides are golden, about 1 minute. Turn sandwiches over and cook, pressing again, until undersides are golden and cheese is melted, about 1 minute.
