Heat oven to 400°F. In a bowl, toss apples with walnuts, ginger, 2 tablespoons sugar, flour and cinnamon. Roll pie crust into a 12-inch circle, about 1/8-inch thick. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray; place pie crust on sheet. (It's OK if the pie crust hangs over the sides.) Arrange apple slices in one layer to form a circle about 3 inches from edge of pie crust; fill in circle with more slices. Scrape any remaining walnuts and ginger from bowl onto apples. Gently fold edges of pie crust over outer edge of apple filling to form a thick crust. Spray outer rim of crust with cooking spray; sprinkle crust with remaining 2 teaspoons sugar. Bake until crust is golden brown and apples are soft, 35 minutes. Cut into 8 slices and serve.
