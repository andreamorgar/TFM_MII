Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease and flour a 9- by 5- by 3-inch loaf pan, knocking out excess flour. Chop onions and in a large skillet cook in butter with 1/2 teaspoon salt over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened and pale golden, about 15 minutes. Cool onions. Into a bowl sift together flour, cornmeal, mustard, baking powder, and remaining teaspoon salt. Stir in poppy seeds and Cheddar. In a small bowl lightly beat eggs and stir in milk. Add milk mixture and onion mixture to flour mixture, stirring until just combined. Pour batter into loaf pan. Bake bread 1 1/4 hours, or until a tester inserted in center comes out clean. Cool bread in pan on a rack 10 minutes. Turn out bread onto rack and cool completely.
