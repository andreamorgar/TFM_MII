Preheat oven to 250°F. Butter a 13x9x2" baking dish; set aside. Soak raisins in 1 cup broth in a small bowl for 30 minutes. Scatter bread in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake, stirring occasionally, until dried out, about 1 hour. Let cool and transfer to a very large bowl. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; add Swiss chard leaves and stir constantly until just wilted. Transfer to bowl with bread. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in same skillet; add stems and cook, stirring often, until crisp-tender, 3-5 minutes. Add to bowl. Heat 4 tablespoons oil and 1/4 cup butter in same skillet; add onions and garlic. Stir often until just beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in vinegar and sugar; cook until vinegar is almost evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add onion mixture to chard in bowl. Add raisins with broth, olives, and next 5 ingredients; gently fold into bread mixture until thoroughly combined. Drizzle in 1 cup broth and toss gently. Let cool completely. Preheat oven to 350°F. Whisk remaining 1 cup broth and eggs in a small bowl. Gently fold into dressing until thoroughly combined. Transfer to prepared dish, cover with foil, and bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of dressing registers 160°F, about 40 minutes. DO AHEAD: Dressing can be made 1 day ahead. Uncover; let cool. Cover; chill. Bake dressing, uncovered, until set and top is browned and crisp, 40-45 minutes longer (if chilled, add 10-15 minutes).
