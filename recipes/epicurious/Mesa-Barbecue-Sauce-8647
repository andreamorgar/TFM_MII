Heat the canola oil until almost smoking in a large saucepan over medium heat and sweat the onion and garlic until softened but not colored, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and simmer 15 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients and simmer 20 minutes. Pour the mixture in a food processor and puree. Pour into a medium bowl and let cool to room temperature. May be refrigerated up to 1 week or frozen.
