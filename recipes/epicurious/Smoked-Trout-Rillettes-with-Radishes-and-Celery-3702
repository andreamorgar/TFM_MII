Mix mascarpone, green onion, chopped dill, and 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice in small bowl. Add trout and stir gently to blend. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired. Transfer mixture to small serving bowl. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before serving. Place bowl with rillettes on platter; surround with crackers, bread slices, radishes, and celery stalks and serve. An oak-aged white wine with grapefruit notes and toasty flavors, like the Rudd 2005 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley, $35), plays well with the smoked trout and radishes. *An Italian cream cheese; sold at many supermarkets and at Italian markets.
