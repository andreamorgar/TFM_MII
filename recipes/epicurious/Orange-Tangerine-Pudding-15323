Whisk together cornstarch, 1/2 cup sugar, and a pinch of salt in a 11/2-quart heavy saucepan, then whisk in juice until smooth. Bring to a boil over moderate heat, whisking constantly, then boil, whisking constantly, until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in butter and zest, then transfer pudding to a metal bowl. Set bowl into a larger bowl of ice and cold water and stir frequently until cold, about 10 minutes. Spoon into glasses on a baking sheet and chill, covered, 10 minutes. Beat cream with remaining 2 teaspoons sugar until it holds soft peaks. Serve puddings topped with cream.
