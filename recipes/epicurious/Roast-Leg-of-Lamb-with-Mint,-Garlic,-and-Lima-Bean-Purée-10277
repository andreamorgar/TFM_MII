Preheat oven to 450°F. Mix oil, chopped mint, parsley, rosemary, and garlic in small bowl. Place lamb, cut side up, on work surface. Sprinkle lamb generously with coarse salt and pepper and rub into meat. Spread herb mixture over top of lamb, then roll up, enclosing herb mixture completely. Sprinkle outside of lamb with coarse salt and pepper. Tie lamb with kitchen string at 2-inch intervals. Place lamb in roasting pan. Roast until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of meat registers 130°F for medium-rare, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Remove pan from oven; let lamb rest 15 minutes. Remove kitchen string from lamb. Cut lamb into 3/4-inch-thick slices; arrange on platter. Garnish with mint sprigs. Serve with Lima Bean Puree.
