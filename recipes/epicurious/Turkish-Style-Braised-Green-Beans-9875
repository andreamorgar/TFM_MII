Cut a small X in bottom of each tomato with a sharp paring knife. Blanch tomatoes in a 3-quart saucepan of boiling water for 10 seconds, then immediately transfer with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking. Drain, peel, and coarsely chop. Cook onions and garlic in oil in a wide 5- to 6-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, 4 minutes. Add beans, water, sugar, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to moderately low, then cover and simmer until beans are very tender, about 45 minutes. Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper. Cool to room temperature, uncovered, about 45 minutes. Serve beans with juices.
