In large skillet over medium heat, heat ghee. Working in batches of 6, sauté pita pieces until crisp, about 4 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and set aside. Wash lentils well in several changes of water until water runs clear. Drain. In large saucepan, combine lentils and enough water to cover by 2 inches. Add tomato, potato, carrot, and salt and bring to boil. Cover and simmer 30 minutes, skimming any foam that forms on top. Remove from heat. Strain, reserving cooking liquid. In blender, purée solids, adding enough reserved liquid to make mixture smooth. Set aside. In medium pot over moderately high heat, heat corn oil. Add onion and sauté until golden, about 10 minutes. Add puréed lentils, beef stock, and cumin. Simmer until soup thickens, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Ladle soup into bowls and sprinkle with chopped parsley. Serve with fried bread wedges.
