Add leeks, garlic, and thyme to pot and sauté until leeks begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Add corn and sauté 2 minutes. Add potatoes, clam juice, and cream; bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Add scallops and bacon and simmer until scallops are just opaque in center, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
