Heat dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions and sprinkle with sugar and 1 teaspoon thyme. Season generously with salt and pepper. Stir to mix. Add 1/2 cup wine. Cover and cook until onions are very soft, about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add vinegar and cook until liquid evaporates and onions are caramelized, about 14 minutes, stirring frequently. Transfer all but 1/2 cup onions to bowl. Season veal with salt and pepper and add to onions in pan. Add broth, tomatoes with liquid, garlic, red pepper, remaining 1 cup wine, and remaining 1 teaspoon thyme. Partially cover and simmer, turning occasionally, 1 hour 15 minutes.

Cover stew and onions separately and refrigerate. Reheat stew and onions over low heat.) Mix basil into veal. Transfer veal shanks to bowls. Pour vegetables and juices over.
