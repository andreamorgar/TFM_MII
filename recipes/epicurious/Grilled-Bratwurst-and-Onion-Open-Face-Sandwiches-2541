Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Whisk beer, mustard, oil and thyme in small bowl to blend. Brush both sides of onion slices with some of mustard dressing, being careful to keep slices intact. Grill onion and bratwurst until onion is tender and slightly charred at edges and bratwurst is golden brown, turning twice, about 10 minutes for onion and 6 minutes for bratwurst. Grill bread until lightly toasted, about 1 minute per side. Place toasted bread on plates. Brush with some of mustard dressing. Top bread with bratwurst; separate onion slices into rings and arrange over bratwurst. Drizzle remaining mustard dressing over onions and serve.
