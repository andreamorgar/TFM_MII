Preheat oven to 400°F. Blanch shrimp in boiling salted water 30 seconds, then drain in a colander and rinse under cold water until cool. Pat shrimp dry and arrange in 1 layer in a buttered 1-quart gratin dish or other ovenproof dish. Stir together butter, garlic paste, and Sherry until blended. Stir in bread crumbs, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Dot shrimp with crumb mixture and sprinkle with almonds. Bake shrimp until just cooked through and topping is lightly browned, about 15 minutes.
