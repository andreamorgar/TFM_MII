• In a small bowl, stir together the yogurt and 2 teaspoons of the seasoning salt. Place the chicken in a large lock-top plastic bag. Add the yogurt mixture and turn the chicken to coat evenly. Seal the bag and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or up to 8 hours, turning occasionally. • Preheat the oven to 425°F. Place the potatoes in a roasting pan and sprinkle the remaining 1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt over them. Remove the chicken from the marinade, reserving the marinade. Place on a rack (a vertical roaster works well), and arrange in the pan on top of the potatoes. Pour the remaining reserved marinade over the potatoes and turn to coat them lightly. • Roast the chicken for about 30 minutes. Turn the potatoes so they cook evenly. Roast for another 20 to 30 minutes, or until the juices run clear when a thigh is pierced with a knife and the potatoes are crispy and cooked through. • Transfer the chicken to a carving board and let rest for a few minutes. Carve into pieces and arrange on a platter. Surround with the potatoes. Pour the juices from the pan over the chicken and potatoes. Garnish with parsley or watercress and serve immediately.
