Place chicken in medium bowl; sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Stir in plain yogurt. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours. Heat vegetable oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallots, chilies, ginger and cumin; sauté until shallots are tender, about 2 minutes. Add chicken with yogurt and sauté until chicken begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 3 minutes. Uncover skillet. Stir in dill. Increase heat to medium-high and simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.
