Split the vanilla bean open and scrape the seeds into a heavy, 1 gallon pot. Put in the milk and 1 1/2 cups sugar and bring to a scald. Put in the tea bags and let steep for 20 minutes. Set aside. Using a tabletop mixer, place the yolks and sugar in the bowl and mix at medium-high speed until the yolks are stiffened and are a pale, yellow color. On low speed, gradually add about 2 cups of the hot milk and vanilla bean mixture. Bring this mixture back to the pot. Cook on medium-low heat until just thickened, and coats the back of a spoon. Immediately strain through a fine strainer and chill overnight. (Putting the tea bags back into the ice cream mixture.) This helps to infuse the flavor of the tea into the milk and cream. Freeze according to manufacturer's instructions.
