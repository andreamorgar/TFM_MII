Cover eggs with cold water by 1 inch in a saucepan and bring just to a boil. Remove from heat and let eggs stand, covered with lid, 17 minutes. Finely grind cumin seeds in an electric coffee/spice grinder or with a mortar and pestle. Drain eggs, then rinse with cold water until no longer hot to the touch. Peel eggs, then halve lengthwise. Carefully remove yolks and mash in a bowl with a fork. Stir in mayonnaise, yogurt, 2 tablespoons chives, lemon juice, cumin, and salt and pepper to taste (filling will be loose). Spoon yolk into whites and sprinkle with remaining tablespoon chives.
