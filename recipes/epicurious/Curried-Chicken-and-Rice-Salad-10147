Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and curry powder and sauté 5 minutes. Add chicken and sauté until cooked through, about 4 minutes. Transfer to large bowl and cool. Mix in rice, peas, bell peppers, raisins and cilantro. Whisk remaining 3/4 cup oil, vinegar and cumin in small bowl to blend. Add enough dressing to salad to season to taste; toss well. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before serving.)
