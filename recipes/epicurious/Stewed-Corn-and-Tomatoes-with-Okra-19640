Cook scallions, jalapeño, bell pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until scallions begin to brown, 7 to 9 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until broken down into a sauce, about 15 minutes. Add corn and okra and cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender, about 15 minutes.
