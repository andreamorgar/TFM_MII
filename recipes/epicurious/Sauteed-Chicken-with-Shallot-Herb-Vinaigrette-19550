Place chicken, grated shallots, and 4 teaspoons oil in large bowl; toss. Refrigerate at least 3 hours and up to 8 hours. Bring 1/3 cup minced shallots, vinegar, and 2 tablespoons water to boil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Boil 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium; simmer until shallots are soft, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Whisk in 5 tablespoons oil, parsley, cilantro, honey, and 2 tablespoons water. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add remaining minced shallots; sauté about 3 minutes. Transfer to small bowl. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in same skillet. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Working in 2 batches, add chicken to skillet; sauté until cooked through, adding more oil if necessary, about 6 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to cutting board. Cut on diagonal into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Divide chicken among 6 plates. Sprinkle with sautéed shallots. Bring sauce to simmer. Spoon over chicken and serve.
