Mix first 5 ingredients together in medium bowl. Season yogurt sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Mix lamb and next 5 ingredients in large bowl until well blended. Season generously with salt and pepper. Shape mixture into four 3/4-inch-thick patties. Preheat broiler. Place lamb patties on broiler rack and broil until cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Open pita bread rounds; line bottoms with trimmed tops, if desired. Place lettuce, burger, then large spoonful of yogurt sauce in each round. Serve, passing sauce separately.
