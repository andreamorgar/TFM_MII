Heat vegetable oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion; sauté until tender, stirring occasionally, about 6 minutes. Add remaining vegetables; sauté until deep golden brown, about 7 minutes. Add 5 cups water; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium, cover and simmer until vegetables are very tender, about 35 minutes. Cool slightly. Working in batches, puree soup in blender. Return soup to pot. Thin with more water if desired. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle into 4 soup bowls. Sprinkle each with 1/2 tablespoon chives and drizzle each with 1 teaspoon truffle oil. Serve immediately.
