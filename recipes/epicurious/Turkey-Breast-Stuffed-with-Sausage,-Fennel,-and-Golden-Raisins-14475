Finely chop white part of onions. Place green parts side by side on 15x10x1-inch heavy rimmed baking sheet to form mat. Mix chopped onions, sausage, raisins, 1 1/2 teaspoons fennel, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in medium bowl. Place turkey on work surface, skin side down. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spoon sausage mixture in row between breast halves. Starting at 1 long side, roll up turkey breast to enclose filling. Tie with kitchen string at 1-inch intervals to hold shape. Place turkey atop onion mat. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill.) Preheat oven to 400°F. Brush oil all over turkey. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and 2 teaspoons fennel. Roast until thermometer inserted into filling registers 155°F, basting turkey every 15 minutes with 1/4 cup broth and adding more broth to pan if drippings burn, about 1 hour 20 minutes. Transfer to platter; let stand 5 minutes. Set baking sheet with onions atop 2 burners. Add 1 cup broth to baking sheet. Bring to boil over medium-high heat, scraping up browned bits. Boil 2 minutes. Strain pan juices into medium bowl; discard solids. Serve turkey with pan juices.
