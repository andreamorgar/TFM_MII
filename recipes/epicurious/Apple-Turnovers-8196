Put oven rack in lower third of oven and preheat oven to 400°F. Butter a large baking sheet. Stir together apple, cranberries, jelly, cornstarch, and cinnamon in a bowl. Roll out pastry on a lightly floured surface into a 12- by 9-inch rectangle. Cut into 6 roughly 4-inch squares. Divide apple mixture among squares, leaving a 1-inch border, and lightly brush egg on border. Dot filling with butter. Fold each pastry into a triangle, enclosing filling, and crimp edges with a fork. Cut 2 small steam vents in top of each turnover. Brush tops lightly with more egg and sprinkle with sugar. Bake on baking sheet until puffed and golden, about 20 minutes. Cool turnovers to warm.
