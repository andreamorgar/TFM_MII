Preheat the oven to 400°F. Cut the vegetables into 1⁄2"-wide spears and toss in a roasting pan with olive oil and herbs to coat. Keep the peels on; that's where the vitamins are. Roast for approximately 40 minutes, turning regularly until all sides have turned a golden brown and the fries are cooked straight through.
