Finely chop garlic. In a saucepan bring soy sauce, mirin or Sherry, and vinegar to a boil with garlic, brown sugar, and gingerroot, stirring until brown sugar is dissolved. Transfer marinade to a metal bowl set in a large bowl of ice and cold water and cool, stirring occasionally, to room temperature. In a small dish arrange pork chops in one layer and pour marinade over them, turning chops to coat well. Marinate chops at room temperature, turning them once, 15 minutes. Pour marinade into a small saucepan and simmer 5 minutes. In a 10- to 12-inch heavy skillet heat oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook chops 6 to 8 minutes on each side, or until just cooked through. Serve chops drizzled with marinade.
