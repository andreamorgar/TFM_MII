Arrange a steamer rack or an inverted pie plate in a deep 12-inch skillet and add 3 cups water to skillet. Cover skillet and bring water to a boil. Pat fillets dry and arrange on a heatproof plate that will fit into skillet with 1 inch clearance around plate. Sprinkle ginger and 1/4 cup scallions evenly on top of fish. Stir together soy sauce and oil in a small bowl and drizzle evenly over fillets. Carefully transfer plate with fish to rack in skillet and cover tightly, then steam over moderately high heat until fish is just cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Carefully remove plate from skillet and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup scallions.
