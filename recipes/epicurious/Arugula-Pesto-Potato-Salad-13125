In a steamer set over boiling water steam the potatoes, covered, for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are just tender, transfer them to a bowl, and let them cool to room temperature. In a blender purée the arugula with the pine nuts, the oil, the Parmesan, the butter, the garlic, and salt and pepper to taste, add the pesto to the potatoes, and combine the salad well.
