Boil broth in small saucepan until reduced to 1 cup, about 12 minutes. Remove from heat. Combine fennel seeds and crushed red pepper in small bowl. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and bell pepper and sauté until golden and almost tender, about 4 minutes. Add squash and sauté until barely tender, about 2 minutes. Stir in half of fennel seed mixture. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to large bowl. Place 3 tablespoons flour in medium bowl. Add chicken and toss to coat with flour; shake off excess. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in same skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken; stir just until cooked through, about 3 minutes. Stir in remaining fennel seed mixture. Return vegetables to skillet. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover and chill.) Toss chicken and vegetables over medium-high heat until heated through. Season with salt and pepper. Mix in 1/4 cup basil. Mix vinegar and brown sugar in small skillet. Mix butter with remaining 1 tablespoon flour in small bowl. Bring vinegar mixture to boil. Add reduced broth and bring to boil. Whisk in butter mixture. Boil until sauce thickens slightly, whisking constantly, about 1 minute. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Arrange 2 polenta triangles on each of 4 plates. Spoon chicken mixture over polenta. Drizzle each with sauce. Garnish with remaining 1/4 cup basil and serve.
