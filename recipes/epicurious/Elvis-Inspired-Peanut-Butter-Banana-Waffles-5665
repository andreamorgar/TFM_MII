Preheat a waffle maker. Preheat the oven to 200˚F In a medium bowl, use the back of a fork to smash the bananas with the peanut butter. Add the eggs, vanilla, and almond milk and whisk to combine. Set aside. In a large bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, baking soda, and salt. Fold the wet mixture into the dry mixture and mix until just combined. Spray the waffle maker with olive oil spray. Spoon 1/3 cup batter into the waffle maker and cook until lightly browned, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. As the waffles are done, transfer them to a baking sheet and place the sheet in the oven to keep warm. Repeat to make the rest of the waffles, spraying the waffle maker with olive oil spray before adding the batter each time. If you like a crispy waffle, pop it in the toaster for a minute before serving and it will crisp up to perfection.
