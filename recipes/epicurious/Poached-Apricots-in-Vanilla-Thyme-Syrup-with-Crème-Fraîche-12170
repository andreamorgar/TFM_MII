Scrape seeds from vanilla bean with tip of a sharp knife into a 2-quart saucepan and add pod, water, sugar, zest, and thyme sprigs. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then add apricots and simmer, stirring once or twice, until tender, 2 to 6 minutes (depending on ripeness). Spoon syrup over warm apricots in bowls and top with dollops of crème fraîche.
