Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Cut each biscuit into 8 pieces; place in prepared dish. Add sauce, green onions and bell pepper and stir to blend well. Bake until top is set and almost firm to touch, about 35 minutes. Sprinkle cheese over evenly. Bake until cheese melts, about 5 minutes longer. Let stand 10 minutes. Cut into squares and serve.
