In a small saucepan, bring cherries, 1/2 cup waterand cinnamon stick to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat; simmer 5 minutes. Stir in syrup; set aside to cool. In a bowl, whisk flours, oats, baking soda and salt. In another bowl, whisk eggs and buttermilk (and almond extract, if desired). Add wet ingredients to dry; stir batter until just combined. Heat a large nonstick pan over medium heat; brush with oil. Pour a scant 1/4 cup batter into pan; sprinkle with 1 1/2 teaspoons almonds. Cook pancake, flipping once, until golden brown, 2 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve pancakes with cherry syrup; top with a dollop of yogurt, if desired.
