Pat chicken dry and rub all over with a lemon half. Season with salt, pepper, and half of rosemary. In a 10-inch heavy skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté chicken, skin sides down, 7 minutes, or until golden brown. Turn chicken over and squeeze juice from remaining lemon half over chicken. Cook chicken, covered, over moderately low heat 30 minutes more, or until cooked through. Transfer chicken to 2 plates. Add garlic and remaining rosemary to skillet and sauté over moderately high heat until just golden. Add water, scraping to loosen brown bits, and simmer 1 minute. Drizzle sauce over chicken.
