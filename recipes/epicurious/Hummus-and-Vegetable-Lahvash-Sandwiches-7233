Spread hummus evenly on lahvash and top with cucumber, carrot, onion, radish, 1/2 cup sprouts, and 1 tablespoon sesame seeds. Roll lahvash up tightly jelly-roll fashion and trim ends. Cut roll crosswise with a serrated knife into 8 pieces. Garnish sandwiches with additional sprouts and remaining 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds. In a food processor blend together garlic paste, chick-peas, tahini, lemon juice, oil, and cumin, scraping down side, until smooth. Add water, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste and pulse until just combined. Hummus may be made 2 days ahead and chilled. Makes about 2 cups.
