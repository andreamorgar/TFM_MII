In a sieve set over a bowl drain pickled watermelon, reserving liquid and rind. Cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices and toss in a large bowl with reserved liquid, vinegar, coriander seeds, peppercorns, and onion. In a large saucepan of boiling water cook shrimp with lemon and salt until just cooked through, about 3 minutes. Drain shrimp in a colander and toss with rind and marinade. Season mixture with salt and chill, covered, at least 2 hours and up to 8 hours, tossing occasionally.
