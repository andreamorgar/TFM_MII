Halve onion lengthwise and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. In a large saucepan cook onion in water, covered, over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes, or until softened. Remove cover and cook onion until any liquid in saucepan is evaporated. Preheat oven to 425°F. Peel parsnips and potatoes. Grate parsnips coarse and cut potatoes crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices. In a 2-cup measure or bowl whisk together milk, broth, and flour until combined well. Add milk mixture to onion with parsnips, potatoes, nutmeg, and salt to taste and simmer, stirring frequently, 1 minute. Pour vegetable mixture carefully into a shallow 1 1/2-quart baking dish and bake in lower third of oven 45 minutes, or until top is golden brown and potatoes are tender when pierced with a knife.
