In a saucepan simmer beets in water to cover by 1 inch, covered, 40 minutes or until tender. Drain beets and cool. Beets may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Peel beets and cut into 3/4-inch wedges. Peel and core pear and cut into 1/2-inch wedges. In a small saucepan heat jelly, lemon juice, and mustard over low heat, stirring, until blended and jelly is melted. In a bowl combine beets and pear with warm dressing, tossing to coat. Divide greens among 4 salad plates and spoon beet mixture over them. Sprinkle salads with chives.
