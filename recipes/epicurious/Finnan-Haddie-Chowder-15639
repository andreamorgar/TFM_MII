In a large saucepan, heat the butter and oil, add the onion, and sauté over low heat for 5 minutes. Add the potatoes and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Add the thyme and wine and boil for a minute or so before pouring in the stock and stirring. Add the milk and bring to nearly boiling, then reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are almost tender, about 10 minutes. Add the corn, finnan haddie, and a grinding of pepper and bring to a simmer. Let simmer until the haddock is just cooked, about 10 minutes. Taste for seasoning, adding a little salt if needed.
