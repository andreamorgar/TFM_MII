Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Sprinkle ribs with salt, pepper and 1/2 teaspoon cumin. Place ribs, meaty side up, on grill. Cover and grill 10 minutes. Meanwhile, mix barbecue sauce, cilantro, onion, bourbon, chili powder and remaining 3/4 teaspoon cumin in heavy small saucepan; bring to boil, stirring occasionally. Place saucepan at edge of grill to keep sauce warm. Turn ribs meaty side down. Cover and grill until cooked through, about 10 minutes. Turn ribs over again; brush meaty side generously with sauce. Cover and grill ribs until sauce sets thickly, about 3 minutes longer. Divide ribs between plates. Serve with remaining sauce.
