Put all the ingredients into a blender, blend for 1 minute. Pour into a screw-top jar. This dressing is excellent for fish or vegetable salads, or for mixed greens as a piquant change from the classic French dressing. It may be prepared ahead of time, kept cold in an air-tight jar, and used as desired.
