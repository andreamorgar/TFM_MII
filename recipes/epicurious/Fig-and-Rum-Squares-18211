Preheat oven to 350°F. Blend flour, butter, 1/2 cup sugar, and salt in processor until coarse meal forms. Add 1 tablespoon rum; blend until moist dough forms. Measure 1 cup dough; reserve for topping. Press remaining dough into 11 1/2 x 7 1/2-inch metal baking pan; do not clean processor. Blend figs, orange juice, orange peel, cinnamon, 1/2 cup sugar, and 3 tablespoons rum in processor to coarse paste. Spread filling over crust. Mix sliced almonds into reserved 1 cup dough. Drop topping by small clumps onto filling. Bake until golden, about 35 minutes. Cool completely in pan. Cut lengthwise into 3 strips, then cut each strip crosswise into 6 pieces.
