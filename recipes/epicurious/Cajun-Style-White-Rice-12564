In a 3-quart heavy saucepan wash rice in several changes of water, pouring off each change of water carefully, until water is almost clear. Drain rice in a sieve and return to pan. Add 3 cups water and salt and bring to a boil, uncovered, without stirring. Boil mixture until surface of rice is covered with steam holes and grains on top appear dry, 8 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook rice, covered, without stirring, 15 minutes. Remove pan from heat and let rice stand, covered, 5 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork.
