In a food processor grind fine the walnuts with the pepper and the salt and transfer the mixture to a shallow bowl. Working in small batches, roll the cheese cubes in the walnut mixture, coating them completely, and transfer them to a tray. The "croutons" keep, covered and chilled, for 3 days. Serve the "croutons" as a topping for tossed green or tomato salad.
