Combine rum and currants in an airtight container; let sit at room temperature overnight. Drain; reserving 2 tablespoons rum. Put butter, confectioners' sugar, and zest in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat until creamy and smooth, about 2 minutes. Add vanilla and reserved rum. Beat well, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Reduce speed to low. Add flour, coconut, and salt, and beat for 3 minutes. Stir in currants by hand. Divide dough in half and form each into a log about 1/2 inches in diameter; wrap in parchment, and refrigerate 1 hour (or up to 3 days). Preheat oven to 325°F. Remove dough from parchment; slice into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Place on parchment paper–lined baking sheets, spacing about 1 inch apart. Bake until pale golden, about 20 minutes, rotating sheets halfway through. Transfer to wire racks to cool completely. Cookies can be stored in airtight containers at room temperature up to 1 week.
