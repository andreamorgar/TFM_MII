Whisk cornstarch, egg whites and salt in large bowl until smooth. Add shrimp; toss to coat. Let shrimp stand at room temperature 20 minutes. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large wok or heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp, garlic and ginger and stir-fry until shrimp is cooked through, about 2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer shrimp to plate. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to wok. Add broccoli and carrots and stir-fry until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Add cashews, teriyaki sauce, Sherry and 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper and cook 1 minute. Return shrimp to wok and stir-fry until coated with sauce and heated through, about 1 minute. Season with salt and additional crushed red pepper, if desired. Spoon shrimp and vegetable mixture onto platter. Spoon cooked rice around edge of platter and serve.
