Preheat oven to 350°F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Mix cheese, black pepper, and cayenne in small bowl. Spoon cheese mixture by generous tablespoonfuls in 6 mounds on each prepared baking sheet, spacing 3 inches apart. Using fingers, spread each mound evenly to 2 1/2-inch round. Bake frico until deep golden and crisp, about 12 minutes. Remove from oven. Slide parchment with frico onto work surface and cool 5 minutes. Slide thin metal spatula under frico to loosen. Cool frico completely on parchment. Frico can be prepared 1 day ahead. Store airtight in single layer at room temperature.
