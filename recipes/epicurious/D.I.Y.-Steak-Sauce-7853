Build a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill or heat a gas grill to high. Drizzle garlic, onion slices, and chiles with oil; turn to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Grill, turning often, until golden brown and softened, about 12 minutes for garlic and 8 minutes for onion and chiles. Let cool slightly. Pop garlic cloves out of skins and reserve. Peel, stem, and seed chiles. Purée garlic, onion, chiles, Worcestershire sauce, and all remaining ingredients in a blender until smooth. Strain.
