In a large sieve rinse olives and drain well. Pit olives and cut into slivers. With a sharp knife butterfly each chicken breast half by horizontally cutting through meat, keeping 1 long side intact, and opening like a book. With a rolling pin lightly pound chicken between sheets of plastic wrap to about 1/8 inch thick. Pat chicken dry and season with salt and pepper. In a 12-inch heavy skillet heat oil and 2 tablespoons butter over moderately high heat until foam subsides and sauté chicken, 1 piece at a time, until golden and just cooked through, about 30 seconds on each side. Transfer chicken as sautéed with tongs to a platter and keep warm, loosely covered with foil. Pour off any fat in skillet. Add wine and deglaze skillet over moderately high heat, scraping up brown bits. Stir in lemon juice and remaining 2 tablespoons butter and heat sauce, swirling skillet, until butter is just incorporated. Remove skillet from heat and stir in olives, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Spoon sauce over chicken.
