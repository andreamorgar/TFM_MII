Brush large bowl with oil. Mix warm water and sugar in processor. Sprinkle yeast over; stir to dissolve. Let stand until mixture bubbles, about 10 minutes. Add flour, 4 1/2 tablespoons oil, and salt. Process 1 minute. Transfer dough to floured surface; knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Transfer to prepared bowl, turning to coat with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Sprinkle cornmeal over rimmed baking sheet. Divide dough into 6 equal portions; roll each into ball. Space dough balls evenly on baking sheet. Lightly spray large sheet of plastic wrap with nonstick spray; place over dough, sprayed side down. Refrigerate 1 hour before rolling and baking.
