Combine the artichokes, olives, and tomatoes. Place the oil and sage in a small saucepan over medium heat and cook for 1 minute. Add the garlic and pepper and cook for a further 2 minutes or until the sage is crisp. Remove from the heat and stir through the vinegar. Pour over the artichoke mixture and stand for 5 minutes before serving. Serve with the fetta and crispbread biscuits or slices of crusty bread.
