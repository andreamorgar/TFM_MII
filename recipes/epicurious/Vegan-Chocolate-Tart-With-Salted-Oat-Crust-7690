Preheat oven to 350°F. Pulse oats, whole wheat flour, coconut oil, agave, cocoa, salt, and cinnamon in a food processor until oats are coarsely ground and mixture looks like wet sand. Firmly press into bottom and up the sides of tart pan. Bake until crust is golden brown and smells toasty, 20–25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack; let cool. Dissolve espresso powder in 3/4 cup very hot water in a food processor. Add cocoa and let sit 5 minutes. Add melted chocolate, agave syrup, vanilla, 2/3 cup coconut oil, and 2/3 teaspoon kosher salt and process until mixture is very smooth and thick, about 30 seconds. Scrape filling into cooled tart shell and smooth top (if making tart in a rectangular shell, you may have a little filling left over; save for another use, like truffles). Tap tart lightly against counter to pop any air bubbles in filling. Cook oats and remaining 1 teaspoon coconut oil in a small skillet over low heat, stirring constantly, until oats are toasted, about 3 minutes. Gradually add half of demerara sugar, stirring constantly, until sugar is melted, then remove from heat and stir in remaining demerara sugar just to coat. Season with kosher salt; let oat mixture cool. Scatter oat mixture over tart, sprinkle with sea salt, and chill until filling is set, at least 1 hour. Cut chilled tart into slices with a dry, hot knife; let sit at room temperature 15–20 minutes before serving. Tart can be made 2 days ahead. Once filling is set, cover and keep chilled.
