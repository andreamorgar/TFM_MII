Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Mix first 4 ingredients in large bowl. Add nectarines, berries and lemon juice; toss to blend. Transfer to prepared dish. Dot with butter. Bake until mixture begins to bubble, about 30 minutes. Mix flour, 1/2 cup crystallized ginger, 1/3 cup sugar, baking powder, lemon peel and salt in medium bowl. Using fingertips, rub in butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add cream; stir until dough forms. Turn dough out onto floured surface and knead gently until smooth, about 6 turns. Roll out to 3/4-inch thickness. Using 2-inch star cookie cutter or round biscuit cutter, cut out biscuits. Reroll dough scraps; cut out additional biscuits. Place biscuits atop hot fruit, spacing closely. Mix 1 tablespoon crystallized ginger, 1 tablespoon sugar and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon in small bowl; sprinkle over biscuits. Bake cobbler until fruit is tender and biscuits are golden, about 25 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
