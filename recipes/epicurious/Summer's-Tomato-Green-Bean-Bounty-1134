1. Place the oil and the onion in a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat. Add the water and cook until the water has evaporated and the onions are beginning to turn golden, about 10 minutes. Add the bacon and stir, cover the pan and let cook until the bacon is cooked through, about 6 minutes. Remove the cover of the pan and sauté until all the liquid has evaporated and both the onions and the bacon are golden. Add the tomatoes, stir, cover, remove from the heat and let sit. 2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the beans, return tothe boil and cook until the beans are tender through and nearly but not quite olive green, about 10 minutes. Drain. Add the beans to the tomato mixture, toss thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a warmed serving bowl.
