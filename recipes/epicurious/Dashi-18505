Using small sharp knife, cut several slits all over kelp. Place kelp and 6 cups water in large saucepan. Bring just to simmer over medium heat. Using tongs, immediately remove kelp and discard. Add bonito shavings to saucepan, reduce heat to medium-low and barely simmer until bonito shavings sink, about 3 minutes. Pour broth through fine strainer; discard bonito shavings. (Can be prepared up to 3 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
