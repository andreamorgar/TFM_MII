Whisk together eggs, cream cheese, white pepper, and salt to taste until cream cheese breaks up into very small pieces. Heat butter in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until foam subsides, then cook eggs, stirring constantly, until just cooked through. Transfer to a plate and cool. Spread butter evenly on 1 side of each bread slice and arrange cucumber slices, overlapping slightly, on top. Spoon eggs over cucumber and top with bell pepper, salmon, and lemon slices. Squeeze lemon over salmon before eating.
