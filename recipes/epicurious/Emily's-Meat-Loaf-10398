Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a large bowl, use your hands to thoroughly mix together the meat, bread crumbs, eggs, tomato juice, onion, celery, bell pepper, parsley, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, and salt. Add the meat mixture to a loaf pan, spreading ketchup on top. Lay bacon strips on top of ketchup and bake for 1 hour. The loaf is done when a knife inserted into the middle feels hot to the touch or when internal temperature reads 160°F.
