Preheat oven to 400&;deg;F. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Add onion and saut&;eacute; until tender, about 8 minutes. Add tomatoes, wine, orange peel, fennel seeds and crushed red pepper. Boil gently until reduced to chunky sauce, breaking up tomatoes with spoon, about 12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm before continuing.) Pour remaining 1 tablespoon oil into small baking dish. Add fish and turn to coat with oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spoon warm sauce over fish. Bake until just cooked through, about 20 minutes. Serve immediately.
