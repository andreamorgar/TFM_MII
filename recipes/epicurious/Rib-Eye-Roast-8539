1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Sprinkle the roast generously with salt and pepper, then place on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. 2. Roast the meat for 2 hours and 20 minutes (or about 14 minutes per pound at 130°F on a meat thermometer) for rare meat. For medium-rare meat, roast until a meat thermometer reads 140°F-145°F. Remove from the oven and let rest for 15 minutes before carving enough meat for one dinner.
