Whisk all ingredients in heavy large saucepan to blend. Whisk over medium-high heat until beginning to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until sauce is thick enough to coat spoon, whisking occasionally, about 25 minutes. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Cool. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over low heat before serving.) Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 11x7-inch glass baking dish. Combine milk, cream, sugar, eggs, egg yolks, vanilla, nutmeg, and salt in large bowl; whisk to blend well. Spread 1 side of each bread slice with butter. Arrange 6 slices, buttered side up, in single layer in prepared dish, trimming to fit. Sprinkle with currants. Top with remaining bread slices, buttered side up. Pour custard through sieve over bread in dish. Let stand 15 minutes, occasionally pressing bread into custard.
