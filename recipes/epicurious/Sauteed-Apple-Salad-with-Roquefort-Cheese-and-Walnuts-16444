Combine vinegar and thyme in small bowl. Gradually whisk in 1/2 cup oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Combine greens, watercress and endive in large bowl. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add apples and sugar and sauté until apples are almost tender, about 8 minutes. Increase heat to high and sauté until golden brown, about 5 minutes longer. Place atop greens in bowl. Sprinkle salad with Roquefort and walnuts. Toss with enough dressing to coat. Serve, passing remaining dressing separately.
