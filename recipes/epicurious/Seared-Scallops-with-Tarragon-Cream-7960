Turn scallops over and cook until opaque in center, about 1 minute longer. Transfer scallops to plate. Tent with foil. Reduce heat to medium. Melt butter in same skillet. Add flour, stir 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk. Simmer until thick and smooth, stirring often, about 3 minutes. Stir in tarragon and any juices from scallops on plate. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon onto plates.
