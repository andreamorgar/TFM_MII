Cut ginger lengthwise into very thin slices with slicer, then cut slices lengthwise into very fine shreds with a sharp knife. Heat oil in a 1-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat until it registers 360°F on thermometer. Fry ginger in 4 batches, stirring frequently, until crisp and golden, 1 to 2 minutes per batch. Transfer with a slotted spoon or skimmer to paper towels to drain. Return oil to 360°F between batches.
