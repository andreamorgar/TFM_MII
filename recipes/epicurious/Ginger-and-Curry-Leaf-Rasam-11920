1. Place the lentils, 4 cups water, turmeric, and salt in a large pot and cook over medium-high heat until the lentils are tender, about 30 minutes, frequently skimming off any foam with a spoon. 2. In a heavy-bottom pot, heat the oil over medium heat and add the curry leaves, stirring until very fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove 4 leaves and reserve for the garnish. To the oil, add the mustard seeds, asafetida, ginger, and tomato and cook until the tomato begins to dry, about 3 minutes. Add the lentils, 2 1/4 cups water, the coconut milk, tamarind, and black pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for another 3 minutes. 3. Season with salt and serve hot, garnished with the fried curry leaves.
