Preheat oven to 400° F. Diagonally cut twenty-four 1/8-inch-thick slices from baguette and arrange in one layer on baking sheets. Brush tops of slices with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Toast slices in middle and upper thirds of oven until golden brown, about 5 minutes, and cool on racks. Toasts may be made 2 days ahead and kept in an airtight container at room temperature.
