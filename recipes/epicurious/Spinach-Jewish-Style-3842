Remove the stems and roots from the spinach. Rinse in many changes of cold water until any trace of sand is removed. Place in a large pot with a pinch of salt and no water other than that retained from washing. Cook over moderately high heat, covered, for 5 minutes. Drain. Soak the raisins in the lukewarm water for a couple of minutes, then drain. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet, add the onion and sauté until the onion is soft and translucent; add the raisins, pignoli, and small amounts of salt and pepper. Sauté, stirring, 1 minute. Add the spinach and nutmeg and sauté, stirring frequently, until the spinach looks dry and crisp.
