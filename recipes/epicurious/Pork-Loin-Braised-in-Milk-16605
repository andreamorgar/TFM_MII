Season pork with 2 teaspoons salt and pepper. In a small heavy pot just wide enough to fit pork loin, heat butter and oil over medium-high heat until butter is melted. Add pork and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Pour off fat in pot; wipe out pot and let pot cool slightly. Add milk and nutmeg. Return pork to pot. Bring milk mixture just to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover pot and simmer gently, turning meat every 30 minutes, until meat is tender but not falling apart, about 2 hours. Transfer meat to a cutting board. Let rest for 10 minutes. Simmer liquid in pot, uncovered, until reduced by two-thirds and small golden-brown curds form throughout sauce, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cut pork into 1/3" slices. Arrange on a serving platter. Spoon sauce over and around pork.
