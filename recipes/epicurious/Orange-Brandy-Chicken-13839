Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Season chicken with rosemary, salt and pepper. Add chicken to skillet and sauté until brown, about 3 minutes per side. Add orange juice concentrate, chicken broth and brandy and simmer until chicken is just cooked through, 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to plate; tent with foil to keep warm. Boil pan juices until thickened to sauce consistency, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Spoon sauce over chicken. Garnish with orange slices, if desired, and serve.
