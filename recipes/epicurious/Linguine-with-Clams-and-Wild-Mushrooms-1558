Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large Dutch oven over high heat. Add mushrooms and sauté until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer mushrooms to plate. Add remaining 3 tablespoons oil and garlic to Dutch oven. Sauté until garlic is tender, about 3 minutes. Add crushed red pepper, then wine and clams. Cover and cook until clams open, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, cook linguine in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain pasta well and transfer to large bowl. Spoon mushrooms over, then top with clam mixture, discarding any clams that do not open. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with chives.
