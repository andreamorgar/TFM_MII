In a food processor grind nuts until they turn into a nut butter. In a bowl whisk together flour, Parmesan, salt, and sugar. With a pastry blender or fingertips blend in butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in nut butter, egg, and cream until mixture just forms a dough (dough will be sticky). On a lightly floured work surface with floured hands knead dough until just smooth. Divide dough in half and form each half into a 9-by-1 1/2 inch log. Freeze logs, wrapped separately in wax paper, until firm, at least 1 hour, and up to 2 days. Bring dough to cool room temperature 15 minutes before proceeding to facilitate slicing. Preheat oven to 400°F. Cut logs diagonally into 1/3-inch-thick slices. Arrange slices 1/2 inch apart on 2 baking sheets and bake in batches in middle of oven 12 minutes, or until undersides are just golden brown. Carefully turn crackers over with a metal spatula and bake about 2 minutes more, or until undersides are just golden brown. Transfer crackers carefully with spatula to a rack (crackers will crisp as they cool) and sprinkle lightly with salt.
