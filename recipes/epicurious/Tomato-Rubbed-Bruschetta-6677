Prepare grill. Brush bread slices on both sides with oil and grill on a rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals until golden, about 1 minute on each side. While bread is grilling, halve garlic and tomato crosswise. Rub grilled bread with garlic and tomato to moisten it (you may have tomato left over) and sprinkle with paprika and salt.
