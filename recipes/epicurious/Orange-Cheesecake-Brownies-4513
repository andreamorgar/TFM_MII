Preheat oven to 350°F. and butter and flour a 9-inch square baking pan, knocking out excess flour. In a bowl stir together cream cheese, sugar, and zest with a wooden spoon until smooth. Beat in egg with a fork until blended and stir in flour. In a heavy 1 1/2-quart saucepan melt butter and chocolate over low heat, stirring, until smooth and remove pan from heat. Cool mixture 10 minutes and stir in sugar and vanilla. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well with a wooden spoon until mixture is glossy and smooth. Stir in flour and salt until just combined. Spread chocolate batter evenly in pan. Drop cheesecake batter by large spoonfuls onto chocolate batter and run a knife through batters to make decorative swirls. Bake brownies in middle of oven 50 minutes, or until cheesecake mixture is pale golden and a tester comes out clean. Cool brownies completely in pan on a rack before cutting into 16 squares. Brownies keep, layered between sheets of wax paper in an airtight container and chilled, 5 days. Brownies may be eaten chilled or at room temperature.
