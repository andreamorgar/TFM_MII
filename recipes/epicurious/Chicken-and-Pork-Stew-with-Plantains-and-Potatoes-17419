Trim off plantain ends and cut 4 vertical slits in skin of each (do not cut into fruit). Microwave 1 minute at 50 percent power then pull off peel. Stir next six ingredients in large pot until paste forms. Mix in meats. Cook over high heat until meats are no longer pink outside, stirring often, about 10 minutes. Add plantains, broth, tomatoes with juice, onion, pepper, and vinegar. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer 20 minutes. Add potatoes and corn to pot. Cover; simmer 40 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Top with cilantro.
