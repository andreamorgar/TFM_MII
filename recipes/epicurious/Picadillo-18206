1. Cook the meat in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring to break up any lumps. Cook for 7 to 8 minutes until browned. Drain off any fat. Stir in 1 cup of the water, the cumin, garlic powder, salt, and pepper and cook for 8 to 10 minutes. 2. Add the onion, tomatoes, and bell pepper and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the remaining 2 cups water and simmer for 8 minutes. To make this really interesting, add some pecans and raisins to the picadillo 2 minutes before it’s done. This variation makes a great stuffing for Chiles Rellenos.
