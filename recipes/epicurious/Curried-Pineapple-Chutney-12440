Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add red onion and bell peppers and sauté until onion begins to soften, about 8 minutes. Add jalapeño chilies and curry powder; stir 2 minutes. Add pineapple cubes, orange juice, apple cider vinegar, and golden brown sugar. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer mixture until thick and reduced to about 7 1/2 cups, stirring often, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Season chutney to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 4 days ahead. Cool completely, then cover and refrigerate.)
