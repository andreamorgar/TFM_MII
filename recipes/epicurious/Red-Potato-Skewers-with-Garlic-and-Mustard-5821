Makes 6 servings. Line baking sheet with heavy-duty foil. Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water just until tender when pierced with sharp knife, about 10 minutes. Drain; cool 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk oil and next 5 ingredients in large bowl to blend. Add potatoes to dressing and toss to coat. Thread potatoes onto skewers, cut side up. Place on prepared baking sheet. (Skewers can be assembled 4 hours ahead. Cover; let stand at room temperature.) Preheat broiler, positioning rack 6 inches from heat source. Broil potato skewers until browned and bubbly, turning halfway through cooking time, about 10 minutes total.
