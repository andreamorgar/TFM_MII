In large, heavy-bottomed stock pot, combine apples, sugar, lemon juice, ginger, cloves, and 1 cup water. Cover and set over high heat. Bring to boil, then reduce heat to moderate and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until apples are very soft, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and blend with whisk, breaking up any remaining apple pieces. Pass through ricer, food mill, or fine-mesh strainer. While applesauce is still warm, stir in sprigs of savory. Let applesauce cool, then remove savory before serving.
