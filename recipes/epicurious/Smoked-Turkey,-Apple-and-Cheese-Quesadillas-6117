1.Lay out tortillas and spread each with 1 teaspoon honey mustard. Place 1 tortilla, mustard side up, in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Top one half with 1/8 cup Monterey Jack cheese, 1 ounce turkey breast, 1/4 of the apple slices and 1/4 cup cheddar. Fold tortilla in half over ingredients and gently press. Cook 3 minutes. Flip and cook until both sides are golden and cheese is oozing slightly, about 2 minutes more. Remove quesadilla from skillet and slice into thirds. Repeat with remaining tortillas.
