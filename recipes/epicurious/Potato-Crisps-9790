Halve rectangle through 1 -inch side to form 2 rectangles about 3 by 1 1/2 by 1/2 inches. With a mandoline or other hand-held slicing device slice potato 1/16 inch thick on the long narrow side of each rectangle to form strips about 3 by 1/2 inches. On oiled sheet arrange strips, 4 at a time, overlapping ends to form squares. Brush each square with oil and sprinkle with salt to taste.
