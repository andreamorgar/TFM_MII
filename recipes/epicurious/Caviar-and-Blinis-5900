1. Combine the pancake mix with the salt, egg, butter or oil, and milk or water. 2. Lightly brush another tablespoon of melted butter onto a skillet over medium-high heat. 3. When the skillet is hot, spoon the batter into it a tablespoon at a time. 4. Cook the blinis until tiny bubbles appear, about 1 minute, then flip them and fry until golden brown on each side. 5. Transfer the blinis to a platter and serve warm with the caviar, crème fraîche, chives, and smoked salmon and onion (if desired).
