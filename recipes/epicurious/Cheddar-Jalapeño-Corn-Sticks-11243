Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 425°F. Heat corn-stick pans in oven 10 minutes. Whisk together cornmeal, sugar, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together buttermilk and egg in another bowl, then add to cornmeal mixture along with Cheddar, scallion, jalapeños (to taste), and 2 tablespoons butter, stirring until just combined. Remove pans from oven and divide remaining 2 tablespoons butter among molds. Quickly divide batter among molds (about 3 tablespoons each)and bake until tops are golden and a wooden pick or skewer comes out clean, 12 to 15 minutes (15 to 20 minutes if using skillet). Cool corn sticks in pans on a rack 3 to 5 minutes before removing from molds. Serve warm. *Available at Bridge Kitchenware (800-274-3435 or 212-838-1901).
