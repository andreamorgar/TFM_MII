Chop duck fat or bacon into small pieces. In a large heavy skillet cook duck fat or bacon over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp and transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Pour half of fat from skillet into heatproof container and reserve. In fat remaining in skillet cook bread crumbs and garlic with salt, stirring occasionally, until golden and transfer to paper towels. Wipe skillet clean and heat reserved fat (adding oil if using bacon fat) over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Sauté kale with salt to taste, turning with tongs to coat, until kale just wilts, about 2 minutes, and toss with cracklings or bacon and bread crumb mixture.
