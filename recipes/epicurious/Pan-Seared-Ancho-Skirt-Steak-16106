Heat a large heavy skillet (preferably cast iron) over moderate heat, then toast chiles, pressing down with tongs, 5 to 10 seconds on each side. Discard stems and seeds and soak chiles in hot water to cover 5 minutes. Drain and tear into pieces. Purée chiles with orange juice, garlic, olive oil, and salt to taste in a blender until smooth, about 2 minutes. Reserve half of sauce in a small serving bowl. Season steak with salt and coat generously with remaining sauce. Heat 2 large heavy skillets (or cook steak in 2 batches) over high heat until hot and add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to each, swirling to coat bottom of skillets. Sear steak 2 to 3 minutes on each side for medium-rare. Serve steak with reserved sauce.
