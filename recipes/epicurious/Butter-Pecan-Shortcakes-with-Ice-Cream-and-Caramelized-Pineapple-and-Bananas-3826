Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 425°F. Line large baking sheet with parchment. Sift first 5 ingredients into large bowl. Rub in butter with fingertips until mixture resembles very coarse meal. Mix in pecans. Whisk milk, 1 egg, sour cream and vanilla in small bowl to blend. Add to flour mixture and toss just until evenly moistened. Using about 1/2 cup dough per shortcake, drop dough onto prepared sheet in 6 mounds. Using floured hands, shape each mound into ball and return to sheet. Brush each with some egg glaze, then sprinkle with additional sugar. Bake shortcakes until golden and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 18 minutes. Transfer to rack; cool. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Rewarm in 350¡F oven 10 minutes before assembling.) Whisk sugar and butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until butter melts and mixture forms dark caramel sauce, about 4 minutes. Add pineapple and bananas; stir gently until fruit is heated through, about 2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. Cut shortcakes horizontally in half; place bottoms on 6 plates. Top each with ice cream, then with fruit. Lean shortcake tops against ice cream and serve.
