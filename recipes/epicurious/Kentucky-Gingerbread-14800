Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease and flour a 9- by 2-inch square baking pan, knocking out excess flour. In a saucepan melt butter and shortening over moderately low heat and remove pan from heat. In a large bowl whisk together eggs, sugar, molasses, spices, and salt and add butter mixture in a slow stream, whisking. In a cup dissolve baking soda in warm water and whisk into batter. Sift flour over batter and whisk until combined well. Add boiling water in a slow stream, whisking, and pour batter into baking pan. Bake gingerbread in middle of oven 45 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Cool gingerbread in pan on a rack. Cut gingerbread into squares and serve warm or at room temperature with whipped cream.
