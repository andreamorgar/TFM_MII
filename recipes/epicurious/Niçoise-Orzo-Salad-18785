In a large saucepan of salted boiling water cook orzo until tender and drain in a colander. Rinse orzo well under cold water and drain well. Transfer orzo to a large bowl. In a small saucepan of salted boiling water cook beans until crisp-tender, about 4 to 5 minutes. Drain beans and add to orzo. In a blender blend together vinegar, lemon juice, anchovies, mustard, and garlic paste. With motor running add oil in a stream and blend until emulsified. Add dressing to orzo mixture with artichokes, tuna, bell pepper, onion, thyme, olives, and salt and pepper to taste and toss well. Salad may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring salad to room temperature before proceeding. Add arugula and toss well
