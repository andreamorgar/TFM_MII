Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 9x13-inch baking dish. Combine cake mix and coconut in large bowl. Add butter and cut in, using fingers or pastry blender, until mixture is crumbly. Press mixture onto bottom and 1 inch up sides of prepared baking dish. Bake until edges of crust are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Arrange apples over crust. Sprinkle apples with 1/4 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Whisk sour cream, egg and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in small bowl to blend. Pour mixture evenly over apples. Bake until apples are tender and custard is set, about 40 minutes. Serve warm.
