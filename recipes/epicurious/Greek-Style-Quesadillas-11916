Preheat oven to 350°F. Place garlic in small baking dish. Top with 2 tablespoons oil. Bake until tender, about 25 minutes. Cool. Combine cucumber, onion, vinegar, sesame seeds, oregano and 3 tablespoons oil in medium bowl. Let stand 30 minutes. Peel and chop garlic. Place in small bowl. Mix in cream cheese and all olives. Drain cucumber salad. Spread 1/4 of cream cheese mixture on cut side of each of 4 pita halves. Spoon 1/2 cup salad over each. Sprinkle both cheeses atop salad. Cover with remaining 4 pita halves. Heat medium skillet over medium heat. Butter sides of each pita. Working in batches, cook quesadillas in skillet until cheese melts, about 3 minutes per side. Garnish with peppers. Cut into wedges.
