Boil celery root in large pot of salted water 5 minutes. Add potatoes and boil until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes longer. Drain well. Return potatoes and celery root to pot. Stir over medium-high heat until dry, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Mash vegetables until smooth. Stir in butter and enough milk to moisten. Season to taste with nutmeg, salt and pepper.
