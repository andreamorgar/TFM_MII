Soak the codfish in cold water to cover for 8 hours, changing the water once during the soaking. Drain and cover with fresh water, bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer until the fish is tender. Heat the olive oil and sauté the garlic and onion. Add the tomatoes and basil and simmer for 30-40 minutes. Add the tomato paste and simmer for 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. The sauce should be quite thick. If it is not, reduce it over a brisk flame, stirring constantly. Pour polenta into an oiled casserole or baking dish and top with codfish. Cover with the tomato sauce, sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese and put under the broiler flame for a minute or two, until the top is glazed. For a Mexican version, chop 2 canned peeled green chilis and add them to the polenta with 1/2 cup grated Gruyère cheese. Add 1 tablespoon chili powder to the tomato sauce, simmer until thick.
