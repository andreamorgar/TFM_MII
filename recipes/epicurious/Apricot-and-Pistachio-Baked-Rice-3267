Preheat oven to 350°F. Wash rice in 6 changes of cold water in a large bowl until water is almost clear. Drain in a large sieve. Bring 6 cups water and salt to a boil in a 4-quart heavy ovenproof pot with a tight-fitting lid, then stir in rice and cook, uncovered, 6 minutes (rice will still be firm). Drain in sieve. Heat oil in dried pot over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then add rice, stirring until well coated, and remove from heat. Stir in remaining ingredients. Bake, tightly covered, in middle of oven until rice is tender, about 18 minutes, then fluff with a fork.
