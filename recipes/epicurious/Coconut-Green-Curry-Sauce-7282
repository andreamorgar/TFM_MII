Peel gingerroot and finely chop. Discard outer leaf from lemongrass and trim root end. Thinly slice lower 8 inches of stalk and in a 2- to 3-quart saucepan combine with gingerroot and mirin. Boil mixture until mirin is reduced to about 3 tablespoons. Add white wine and boil until liquid is reduced to about 1/4 cup. Add coconut milk and cream and boil, stirring occasionally, until thickened slightly. Pour sauce through a fine sieve into a bowl and stir in curry paste. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Sauce may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered. Reheat sauce before serving.
