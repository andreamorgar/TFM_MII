In a small bowl whisk together vinegar, oil, and salt and pepper to taste. In a resealable plastic bag combine chicken with oil mixture and marinate, chilled at least 8 hours or overnight. Cut mangoes by slicing just to sides of each pit and with a 3/4-inch melon-ball cutter scoop flesh from mango halves. (There should be about 48 mango pieces.) Mango may be scooped 8 hours ahead and chilled, covered. Just before serving, assemble hors d'oeuvres by threading 1 chicken piece, 1 mint leaf, and 1 mango piece on each pick and arrange on a platter. Sprinkle hors d'oeuvres with freshly ground black pepper if desired and garnish with mint sprigs.
