Preheat the oven to 400°F. Pat turkey breast dry with paper towels and season both sides liberally with salt and pepper. Heat a large cast-iron skillet over very high heat. Add the duck fat to the skillet. When the fat shimmers, add the turkey breast, skin-side down, and cook until dark golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and remove the turkey from pan. Carefully stir the butter into the pan juices. Arrange the thyme branches in the skillet to make a bed for the turkey. Place the turkey, seared-side-up, on the thyme and sprinkle the garlic around the sides. Baste the turkey, and transfer the pan to the oven. Roast, basting every 15 minutes, until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast without touching bone registers 155°F, about 1 hour. Baste once more and transfer the turkey to a platter. Let the turkey rest for at least 20 minutes before slicing and serving. While the turkey roasts, prepare the puree. In a medium saucepan, heat the stock over medium-high, add the green onions, and simmer until tender, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the scallions to a blender, reserving the cooking liquid. Blend on high until very smooth, about 5 minutes, adding a splash of cooking liquid if necessary to help the blender puree the scallions. Add the cream cheese and blend for 2 minutes more. Season with salt to taste. Slice the turkey breast across the grain and serve with the green-onion puree.
