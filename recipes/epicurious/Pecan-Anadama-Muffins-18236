Preheat oven to 400°F. and butter twelve 1/3-cup muffin tins. In a bowl whisk together flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, salt, currants, and pecans. In a small bowl whisk together sour cream, eggs, butter and molasses. Add sour cream mixture to flour mixture, stirring until just combined (do not overmix). Divide batter evenly among muffin tins and bake in middle of oven 15 to 20 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean.
