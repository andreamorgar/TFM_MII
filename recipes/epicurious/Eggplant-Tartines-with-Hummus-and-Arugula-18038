Preheat broiler. Brush eggplant on both sides with 3 tablespoons oil (total). Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Broil in 1 layer in an oiled 4-sided sheet pan 5 to 7 inches from heat, turning once, until browned and tender, 8 to 10 minutes total. Cool completely, then coarsely chop. Whisk together sun-dried tomatoes, Sriracha (if using), and remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large bowl. Add arugula and salt to taste, then toss. Spread hummus on baguette, then make open-face sandwiches with eggplant and arugula.
