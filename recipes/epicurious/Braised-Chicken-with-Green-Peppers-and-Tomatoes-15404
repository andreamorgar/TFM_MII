Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Working in batches, cook chicken until golden brown, about 4 minutes total, adding more oil as needed. Transfer to platter (reserve skillet). Add onion, garlic, and parsley to same skillet; sauté until onion is soft, scraping up browned bits, about 4 minutes. Add green peppers, tomatoes, and wine; return chicken to skillet. Cover; simmer over medium-low heat 30 minutes. Uncover; cook until chicken is tender and sauce is reduced, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
