Preheat oven to 450°F. Spray small baking sheet with nonstick spray. Whisk oil and mustard in medium bowl to blend. Sprinkle salmon with salt and pepper. Place on prepared baking sheet, skin side down. Brush top of salmon with 2 tablespoons mustard-oil mixture. Roast salmon until fish is cooked through, about 13 minutes. Preheat broiler. Whisk cranberry relish, shallots, and vinegar into remaining mustard-oil mixture. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Broil salmon until top is browning in spots, about 30 seconds. Transfer to plates. Spoon sauce over; serve.
