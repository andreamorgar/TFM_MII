Pulse avocados, onion, garlic, chile, salt and cumin in a food processor until pureed. Add yogurt and cilantro; pulse until well combined. Transfer avocado mixture to a bowl. Stir in 1/2 cup ice water and lime juice. (Thin with more water, if desired.) Cover and chill until cold, 1 hour. Divide soup among 4 bowls; garnish with chips and salsa before serving.
