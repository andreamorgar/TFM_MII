Whisk in butter, 1 piece at a time, allowing butter to melt before adding more. Remove from heat. Stir in lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and keep warm. Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over high heat. Sprinkle shrimp with salt and pepper. Add to skillet and sauté until shrimp are opaque in center, about 3 minutes. Transfer shrimp to plates.
