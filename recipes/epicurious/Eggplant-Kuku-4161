Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Bake eggplant, cut sides down, in an oiled shallow baking pan until very tender, about 30 minutes. When cool enough to handle, scrape flesh into a food processor, discarding skin, and purée until smooth. Add egg yolks, cheese, garlic, lemon juice, pepper, and 3/4 teaspoon salt and pulse until blended. Transfer to a bowl. Pour melted butter into a 6-cup (1 1/2-quart) gratin dish or a 91/2-inch deep-dish pie plate and tilt to coat bottom. Beat egg whites with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt using an electric mixer at medium speed until they just hold stiff peaks. Fold one third of whites into eggplant mixture to lighten, then fold in remaining whites gently but thoroughly. Spoon into gratin dish. Bake until golden and puffed, 25 to 30 minutes.
