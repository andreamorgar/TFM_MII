Blend flour, sugar and salt in processor 5 seconds. Add butter; cut in using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal. Mix in vanilla and and enough water to form moist clumps. Knead dough briefly on work surface to combine; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic; chill until firm, at least 2 hours and up to 1 day. Preheat oven to 375°F. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round. Transfer dough to 11-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Gently press dough into pan; trim excess dough. Freeze crust 30 minutes. Place tart pan on baking sheet. Bake crust until light golden, piercing with toothpick if crust bubbles, about 25 minutes (crust may shrink slightly). Cool crust on sheet. Maintain oven temperature. Combine cream, 1/4 cup sugar, flour, brandy, yolks and vanilla in processor; blend until smooth. Arrange apricot quarters cut side down in prepared crust. Pour custard over. Sprinkle with remaining 3 tablespoons sugar. Bake tart on baking sheet until apricots are tender and filling is puffed and set, about 30 minutes. Cool tart on rack to room temperature, about 2 hours. Push pan bottom up to free tart from pan. Cut tart into wedges and serve.
