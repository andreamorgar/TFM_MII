Preheat oven to 350°F. Boil yams in pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 20 minutes. Add apple; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain well. Place yams and apples on large baking sheet. Bake until slightly dry, about 10 minutes. Blend yams and apple in processor until smooth. Add butter and spices; blend until butter melts. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Chill.) Transfer mixture to medium saucepan. Stir yams over medium-low heat until hot.
