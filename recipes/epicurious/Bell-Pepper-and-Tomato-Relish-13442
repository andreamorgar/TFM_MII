Bell Pepper and Tomato Relish Use this versatile relish alongside roast chicken or pork, or as a pizza topping. Preheat oven to 400°F. Brush bell peppers with 2 tablespoons oil; arrange on baking sheet. Roast until peppers are tender and begin to brown, turning occasionally, about 35 minutes. Cool peppers 10 minutes. Peel, seed and slice peppers. Heat remaining 4 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add tomatoes and garlic. Sauté until tomatoes soften, about 5 minutes. Add peppers to skillet; sauté about 3 minutes. Add cilantro and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Serve at room temperature.
