In a large skillet cook the pine nuts in the oil over moderate heat, stirring, for 2 minutes, or until they are golden, and transfer them with a slotted spoon to a small dish. In the skillet cook the onion, stirring occasionally, until it is golden, add the spinach, and cook the mixture, covered, stirring once every minute, for 3 minutes, or until the spinach is wilted and tender. Stir in the sour cream, the lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste, remove the skillet from the heat, and sprinkle the mixture with pine nuts.
