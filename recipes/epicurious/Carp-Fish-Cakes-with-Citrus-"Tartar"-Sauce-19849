In medium bowl, stir together all ingredients. Cover and chill. Line large baking sheet with waxed paper. Working in 2 batches, in food processor pulse carp until coarsely ground (do not purée to paste). Transfer to large bowl and add onion, cilantro, mayonnaise, egg, lemon juice, and orange juice. Mix gently until well blended, then add matzoh meal, salt, and pepper and mix gently until incorporated. Using wet hands, roll mixture into 1 1/4-inch-diameter balls and press into 1/2-inch-thick patties. Arrange on baking sheet with additional waxed paper between each layer of patties. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. In large heavy skillet over high heat, heat 1/4 inch oil. Working in batches of 5 and adding more oil as needed, fry patties until brown, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with sea salt while still hot. Serve warm with sauce.
