Cook asparagus in large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Cut top 6 inches from asparagus. Set 6-inch asparagus tips aside. Slice remaining asparagus into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Transfer slices to large bowl. Mix in 1/2 cup chives. Cut peel and white pith from oranges. Working over bowl, cut between membranes to release segments. Drain off juices. Transfer segments to bowl with asparagus slices and chives. Gently mix in crabmeat. Season salad to taste with salt and pepper. Whisk 3 tablespoons fresh orange juice, sugar, vinegar, and orange peel in medium bowl until sugar dissolves. Whisk in mustard. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper. Divide asparagus stalks among 6 plates. Mound salad in center of plates. Pour dressing over each salad. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons chives.
