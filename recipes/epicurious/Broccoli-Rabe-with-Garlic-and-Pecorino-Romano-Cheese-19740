Cook broccoli rabe in large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Drain and transfer to bowl of ice water to cool. Drain again; pat dry. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Wrap in paper towels. Enclose in plastic bag and chill.) Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add broccoli rabe and sauté until heated through, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Sprinkle 4 tablespoons cheese over and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to warm platter. Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons cheese over.
