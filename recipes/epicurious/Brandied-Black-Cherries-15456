Trim the stems of the cherries to within 1" of the fruit. Bring 1 cup sugar and 2 cups water to a boil in a saucepan over medium heat. Blanch the cherries, a cup at a time, for 2 minutes in the simmering syrup. Remove to a platter with a slotted spoon and cool. Add remaining sugar to the syrup and cook until the sugar is dissolved and the syrup is at the boiling point. Remove from heat and cool. Spoon the cherries into sterilized preserving jars . Add the brandy to the cooled syrup, pour over the cherries and seal. Keep in a cool dry place for 4 months before using.
