Sprinkle veal on both sides with salt and pepper. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook veal until golden, about 20 seconds per side. Transfer to plate. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in same skillet. Add shallots; sauté 30 seconds. Add mushrooms; sauté until brown, about 3 minutes. Stir in tarragon. Add wine; cook over high heat until almost all liquid evaporates, stirring to scrape up browned bits, about 2 minutes. Add cream; boil until reduced by 1/4, about 1 minute. Stir in mustard. Using tongs, return veal to pan; simmer until heated through. Divide veal and sauce among 6 plates and serve.
