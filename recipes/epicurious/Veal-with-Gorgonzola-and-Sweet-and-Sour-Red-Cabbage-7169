Boil both stocks in medium saucepan until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 15 minutes. Set aside. Preheat oven to 200°F. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, dredge veal in flour, shaking off excess. Sauté veal until brown and cooked through, adding more oil to skillet as needed, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to baking sheet; keep warm in oven. Add wine to same skillet and boil over medium-high heat until liquid is reduced by half, scraping up any browned bits, about 2 minutes. Add stock mixture and boil until liquid is reduced to 1/3 cup, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add cream and Gorgonzola; simmer until cheese melts. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer veal to platter and spoon sauce over. Serve with Sweet-and-Sour Red Cabbage.
