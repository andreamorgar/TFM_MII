Mix together beef, onion, bell pepper, garlic, cilantro, oregano, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, a scant 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Form into 4 (4 1/2-inch-wide) patties. Heat a large griddle or 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat until hot, then lightly toast buns. Oil griddle, then cook patties, turning once, about 8 minutes total for medium-rare. Transfer to buns. Mix together cabbage, carrot, and 1/4 teaspoon salt, then cook, turning occasionally, until slightly wilted, about 2 minutes. Divide among burgers. Oil griddle again, then sear onion and tomato, turning once, until slightly charred, about 2 minutes total. Divide among burgers. Stir together ketchup, mayonnaise, and mustard, then top burgers with sauce.
