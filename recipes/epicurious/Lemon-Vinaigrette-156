In medium heavy saucepan over very low heat, combine oil, lemon peel, lemon thyme, and lemongrass. Cook, uncovered, until aromatic, about 1 hour. Do not let oil boil. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Strain through fine-mesh sieve into medium heatproof container and refrigerate until cool, about 1 hour. (Oil can be refrigerated, in airtight container, up to 5 days). In medium bowl, whisk together lemon juice, mustard, salt, and pepper. Slowly whisk in 1/4 cup lemon oil, then olive oil. (Vinaigrette can be made up to 3 hours ahead and chilled, covered. Bring to room temperature and stir before serving.)
