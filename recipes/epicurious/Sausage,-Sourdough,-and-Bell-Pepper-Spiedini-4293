Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Whisk first 4 ingredients in small bowl, then whisk in oil. Season dressing with salt and pepper; set aside. On each of 8 metal skewers, alternately thread 3 bell pepper pieces, 2 sausage pieces, 4 onion pieces, and 2 bread cubes. Brush skewers all over with 1 tablespoon dressing each. Grill until lightly charred, turning often, about 12 minutes. Toss greens in large bowl with enough remaining dressing to coat; divide among 4 plates. Top with skewers. Brush skewers with more dressing.
