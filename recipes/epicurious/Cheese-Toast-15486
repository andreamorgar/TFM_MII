Spread bread with a thick layer of French mustard, then cover the whole surface of the bread with strips of cheese. Put slice of bread on an ovenproof dish and under the grill until the cheese softens and turns golden brown. Just before it begins to run, remove the dish and carry it to the table. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cut slice in four and serve on hot plates.
