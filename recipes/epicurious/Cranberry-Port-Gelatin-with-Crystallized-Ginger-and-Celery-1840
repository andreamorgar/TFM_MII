Place gelatin in large mixing bowl. Pour Port over gelatin; let stand 5 minutes. Bring cranberry juice, cloves, and cardamom to boil in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Pour hot cranberry juice mixture over gelatin. Stir until gelatin is completely dissolved, about 4 minutes. Let cool 30 minutes. Strain into medium bowl; discard spices. Chill gelatin mixture until beginning to set (mixture will fall from spoon in soft clumps), about 30 minutes. Stir in diced celery and ginger. Lightly spray 1-quart mold with nonstick spray. Pour gelatin mixture into mold; cover surface with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Keep refrigerated.) Remove plastic wrap. Invert gelatin onto plate. Garnish with celery leaves.
