Mix chicken broth, soy sauce, 1/3 cup corn syrup and next 5 ingredients in heavy large skillet. Bring mixture to boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 5 minutes. Add chicken; simmer 8 minutes. Turn chicken over, cover skillet and turn off heat. Let stand 30 minutes to finish cooking chicken. Blend chili-garlic sauce, 1/2 cup corn syrup and 3 tablespoons poaching liquid in small bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer chicken to plate; cool 10 minutes. (Dressing and chicken can be made 1 day ahead. Cover separately; chill.) Cut chicken crosswise into thin slices. Combine greens and jicama in large bowl. Toss with enough dressing to coat lightly. Divide salad among 6 plates. Top each with chicken; drizzle with some dressing. Garnish with sprouts and serve.
