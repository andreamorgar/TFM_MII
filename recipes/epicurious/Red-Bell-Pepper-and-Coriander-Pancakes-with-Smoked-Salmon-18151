In a bowl stir together all pancake ingredients except egg whites and season batter with salt and pepper. In another bowl with an electric mixer beat egg whites until they just hold stiff peaks and gently fold into batter. Heat a non-stick skillet over moderate heat and brush with some melted butter. Working in batches, drop tablespoonfuls of batter into skillet to form pancakes 1 1/4 inches in diameter. Cook pancakes until bubbles appear on surface and undersides are golden, about 1 minute. Turn pancakes and cook until undersides are golden. Transfer pancakes to a rack and cool. Spoon about 1/2 teaspoon sour cream onto center of each pancake and top with a twisted smoked salmon strip and a coriander leaf.
