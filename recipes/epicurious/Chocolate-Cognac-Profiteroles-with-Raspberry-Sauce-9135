Preheat oven to 375°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine 3/4 cup water, butter, sugar and salt in heavy medium saucepan. Bring to boil. Remove from heat. Add flour; stir vigorously with wood spoon until mixture is smooth. Stir over medium heat until mixture forms ball, about 3 minutes (mixture will be stiff). Stir 2 minutes longer to allow flour to cook thoroughly. Remove from heat. Make well in center; break 1 egg into well. Stir vigorously until egg is incorporated and mixture is smooth. Repeat with remaining eggs, adding 1 at a time. Transfer dough to pastry bag with 1/2-inch plain round tip. Pipe 1 1/4-inch-diameter, 1-inch-high mounds spaced 2 inches apart onto baking sheets. Bake profiteroles until puffed and golden, about 35 minutes. Cool on sheets. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.) Cut 12 profiteroles horizontally in half (reserve remainder for another use). Fill each bottom half with 1 heaping tablespoon chocolate cream. Cover with tops. (Can be made 3 hours ahead. Cover; chill.) Divide Raspberry Sauce among 4 plates. Top each with 3 profiteroles. Drizzle with Chocolate Sauce.
