Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic and sauté until onion is tender, about 6 minutes. Add rice and stir until rice is translucent, about 2 minutes. Add broth and wine and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low; cover and cook until rice is almost tender, about 15 minutes. Mix in spinach. Cover and cook until rice and spinach are tender and all liquid is absorbed, about 8 minutes longer. Mix in tomatoes and cheese. Season with salt and pepper and serve.
