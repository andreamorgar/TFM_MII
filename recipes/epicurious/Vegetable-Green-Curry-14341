Sauté bell peppers and onion in oil with salt and pepper to taste in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until edges of vegetables are golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and curry paste and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add sweet potatoes, coconut milk, and water and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are almost tender, about 3 minutes. Add snow peas and simmer, uncovered, until sauce is slightly thickened. Stir in cilantro.
