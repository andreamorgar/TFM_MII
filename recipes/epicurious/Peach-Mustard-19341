Using the tip of a paring knife, score an X in the bottom of peach. Cook in a small saucepan of boiling water just until skin begins to peel back where cut, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a bowl of ice water; let cool. Peel and coarsely chop. Bring peach, sugar, vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 2 tablespoons water to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until peach is very soft and mixture thickens slightly, 5–8 minutes. Pulse in a blender until chunky (do not purée). Transfer to a medium bowl; let cool. Mix in Dijon and whole grain mustards and chives; season with salt and pepper.
