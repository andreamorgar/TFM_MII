Bring milk, coarse salt, and nutmeg to simmer in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Turn heat to very low; gradually whisk in semolina. Cook until mixture is very thick, whisking constantly, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk in egg yolks, then Parmesan cheese and 2 tablespoons butter. Pour semolina into 13x9x2-inch baking pan; spread evenly. Cover pan tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours. DO AHEAD: Semolina can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled. Preheat oven to 400°F. Coat large rimmed baking sheet with remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Cut chilled semolina into twelve 3-inch squares. Carefully arrange semolina squares on prepared baking sheet, spacing apart. Bake gnocchi until bottoms brown, about 15 minutes. Available at some supermarkets and at specialty foods stores and Italian markets.
