Cut the tomatoes into 1/4-inch-thick slices and arrange half the slices in one layer in a shallow serving dish. In a small bowl combine the sugar and the salt and sprinkle the layer of tomatoes with half the mixture. Arrange the remaining tomato slices on top and sprinkle them with the remaining sugar mixture. Drizzle the tomatoes with the oil and the vinegar and let the salad stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Sprinkle the salad with the mint and arrange the onion, drained and separated into rings, on top.
