Mince enough lemongrass from lower 4 inches of stalk to measure 2 tablespoons. Coarsely grind coriander seeds in grinder or with mortar and pestle, then stir together with lemongrass and remaining ingredients except sirloin in a bowl. Prepare grill for direct-heat cooking with medium-hot charcoal. Toss sirloin with 1/3 cup spice paste in a large bowl and thread chunks 1/4 inch apart onto skewers. Oil grill rack, then grill kebabs, turning occasionally and moving around if flare-ups occur, 5 to 6 minutes for medium-rare.
