In a large saucepan combine potatoes with enough water to cover by 1 inch and simmer until just tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. Drain potatoes and cool until they can be handled. While potatoes are cooling, in a bowl combine remaining ingredients with salt and pepper to taste. Cut potatoes into 1/2-inch dice and gently toss with egg mixture. Serve potato salad chilled or at room temperature.
