Combine potatoes, parsnips and bay leaf in medium saucepan. Add enough cold water to cover vegetables. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until vegetables are very tender, about 20 minutes. Drain well; discard bay leaf. Return vegetables to same saucepan. Add 1/2 cup milk and mash vegetables to coarse puree. Add more milk, if desired. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl. Drizzle with melted butter and serve.
