Combine tofu, lemongrass, ginger, chile paste, lime juice, and rice wine in a small bowl and toss. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes. Mix coconut milk, broth, soy sauce, and sesame oil in a bowl; set aside. Coat a large sauté pan with canola oil and set over medium-high heat. Add tofu and sauté, stirring, for 2 or 3 minutes. Add carrots, mushrooms, and broccoli and sauté, stirring, for another 2 or 3 minutes. Stir in coconut milk mixture and onions and cook 5 minutes or until vegetables are tender. (If using shrimp, toss in last, just long enough to heat.) Combine rice, broth, and bay leaf in saucepan over medium heat and simmer, covered, 25 to 30 minutes or until rice absorbs all liquid. Remove from heat. Discard bay leaf. Place equal portions of cooked brown rice on each plate and top with stir-fry.
