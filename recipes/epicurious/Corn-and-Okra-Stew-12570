Simmer corn, broth, and water in a 4- to 6-quart heavy pot, uncovered, until corn is very tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer with tongs to a plate and cool. Cut off kernels and return cobs to liquid with shrimp shells. Simmer 5 minutes, then pour broth through a sieve into a large bowl, discarding cobs and shells. Chop garlic in a food processor. Add onions and poblano and pulse until chopped. Cook onion mixture in oil with cayenne and black pepper in cleaned pot over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened, about 8 minutes. Add sausage and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add broth and bring to a simmer. Add okra, tomatoes, and salt, then simmer, partially covered, until okra is tender but not falling apart, about 30 minutes. Add corn and shrimp and cook, stirring, until shrimp are just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in scallions and season with salt and pepper.
