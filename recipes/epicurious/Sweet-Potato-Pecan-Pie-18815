Cut potato in half; scoop flesh into medium bowl and mash. Measure 1 cup mashed potato; place in large bowl. Whisk sugar and next 5 ingredients into mashed potato; spread mixture in prepared crust. Whisk corn syrup and eggs in bowl to blend. Stir in pecans. Pour syrup mixture over potato mixture. Bake pie until filling is set, puffed and brown, about 45 minutes. Cool pie completely.
