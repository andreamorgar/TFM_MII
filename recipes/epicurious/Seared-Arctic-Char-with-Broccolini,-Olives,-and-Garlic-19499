Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add broccolini and stir 1 minute. Pour 1/2 cup water over, cover, and cook just until broccolini is crisp-tender and water evaporates, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and stir 30 seconds. Stir in olives and 2 teaspoons orange peel. Transfer mixture to bowl; set aside (do not clean skillet). Heat 1 tablespoon oil in same skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper. Add fish to skillet, skin side down, and cook until skin is crisp, about 3 minutes. Turn fish over and cook just until fish is opaque in center, about 2 1/2 minutes longer. Transfer to plates. Return broccolini mixture to same skillet to rewarm; stir in 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon mixture over fish. Drizzle fish lightly with oil and 1 tablespoon vinegar (or more if desired). Sprinkle with remaining 1 teaspoon slivered orange peel and serve.
