In a small saucepan combine the brown sugar, the butter, the cinnamon, the vanilla, the salt, and the zest and cook the mixture over moderately low heat, stirring, until the brown sugar is dissolved. In a bowl stir together the coconut, the almonds, the oats, and the wheat germ, add the brown sugar mixture, and toss the mixture until it is combined well. Spread the granola in a jelly-roll pan, bake it in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven, stirring every 5 minutes, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it is golden, and let it cool. The granola keeps in an airtight container for 1 week. Serve the granola as a topping for fruit salad.
