Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Place tenderloins on work surface. Starting at 1 long side, cut each horizontally to within 1/2 inch of opposite side. Open like book and sprinkle with salt. Spread 1 tablespoon chopped chiles down center of each tenderloin. Close tenderloins, pressing to adhere, and sprinkle with salt. Whisk yogurt, 1 tablespoon oil, cumin, and 1 tablespoon adobo sauce in small bowl to blend. Transfer tenderloins to plate and brush each heavily with some yogurt sauce. Set tenderloins aside 15 minutes. Brush grill rack with oil. Grill tenderloins, brushing occasionally with remaining yogurt sauce, until just cooked through and thermometer inserted into thickest part of meat registers 145°F, about 10 minutes per side. Transfer tenderloins to platter. Let stand 5 minutes, then cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Serve tenderloins with guacamole.
