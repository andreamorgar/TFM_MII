In a bowl toss together cheeses and cornstarch. Rub inside of a heavy 3- to 4-quart saucepan with garlic halves, leaving garlic in pan, and add wine and lemon juice. Bring liquid just to a boil and stir in cheese mixture by handfuls. Bring mixture to a bare simmer over moderate heat, stirring, and stir in kirsch, nutmeg, chilies, and pepper to taste. Transfer fondue to a fondue pot and set over a low flame. Stir in fried shallots, scallions, and/or bacon if using and serve fondue with accompaniments for dipping. (Stir fondue often to keep combined.) In a heavy 10- to 12-inch skillet cook shallots in oil moderately high heat, stirring, until golden brown. Transfer shallots with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and season with salt. Makes about 2/3 cup.
