Cook tomatoes with garlic, salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in 2 tablespoons oil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes have broken down and sauce is thickened, 8 to 12 minutes. While tomatoes are cooking, pulse olives, capers, and 2 tablespoons pine nuts in a food processor until coarsely chopped and transfer to a bowl. Stir in bread crumbs, cheese, 2 tablespoons parsley, 1 tablespoon oil, and remaining 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Pulse tomato sauce in cleaned processor until coarsely puréed, then return to saucepan and keep warm. Pound meat between 2 sheets of plastic wrap with flat side of a meat pounder or with a rolling pin until 1/8 inch thick, then cut each piece in half crosswise. Sprinkle 1 piece of beef evenly with one fourth of filling. Starting with a long side, roll up beef, then tie in 3 places with kitchen string. Season beef roll well with salt and pepper. Make 3 more rolls with remaining beef and filling. Heat remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until just beginning to smoke, then cook beef rolls, turning, until well browned on outside, 3 to 4 minutes for medium-rare. Let beef stand 5 minutes. Cut off kitchen string and halve each roll diagonally. Spoon sauce onto 4 plates, then top with beef and sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons each of pine nuts and parsley.
