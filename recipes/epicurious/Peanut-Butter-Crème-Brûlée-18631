Preheat oven to 300°F. Stir milk, whipping cream, and 6 tablespoons sugar in medium saucepan over medium-high heat just until sugar dissolves, removing from heat when bubbles begin to form around edges. Place peanut butter in large heat-resistant bowl. Add 1 cup hot milk mixture to peanut butter and whisk until smooth; return peanut-butter-milk mixture to pan and whisk to blend. Whisk egg yolks in same large bowl. Gradually whisk hot peanut-butter-milk mixture into yolks; return to same saucepan. Stir mixture over medium heat until custard thickens enough to leave path when finger is drawn across, about 4 minutes. Strain custard into large measuring cup. Divide custard among six 3/4-cup ramekins or custard cups. Place ramekins in large roasting pan. Add enough hot water to pan to reach halfway up sides of ramekins. Bake custards until sides are set and centers jiggle only slightly when dishes are nudged, about 40 minutes. Cool slightly. Remove ramekins from water bath and refrigerate uncovered until cold, about 4 hours. DO AHEAD Custards can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated. Sprinkle each custard with 1 teaspoon sugar. Using kitchen torch, melt sugar until deep amber color or, alternatively, place custards under broiler until sugar melts and turns deep amber. Refrigerate custards until sugar hardens, about 15 minutes. DO AHEAD Can be made 1 hour ahead. Keep refrigerated.
