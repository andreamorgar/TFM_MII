Preheat oven to 350°F. Line bottom of heavy large ovenproof pot with half of romaine lettuce. Toss pork, onions, 1/4 cup lemon juice, dill, oil, sugar and lemon peel in large bowl to blend. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Place pork mixture in pot. Top with remaining romaine lettuce. Bring to boil over high heat. Cover pot. Transfer to oven and bake until pork and onions are tender, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Strain juices from stew into medium saucepan; mix in cream. Boil until sauce thickens enough to coat spoon, about 10 minutes. Return sauce to stew. Season stew with salt, pepper and more lemon juice, if desired. Rewarm stew; transfer to large bowl and serve.
