In a small heavy skillet melt the butter over moderately low heat, add the cumin, the chili powder, the cayenne, the salt, and the paprika, and cook the spices, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the nuts and stir them to coat them well. Transfer the coated nuts to a baking pan large enough to hold them in one layer and toast them in a preheated 350°F. oven for 5 minutes. Let the nuts cool and transfer them to serving dish.
