Arrange quail halves in one layer in a shallow flameproof baking pan. Chop cilantro and in a small bowl stir together with gingerroot, soy sauce, cumin, ground coriander, and oil. Spoon marinade over quail, turning to coat and rubbing marinade into both sides. Marinate quail, covered and chilled, at least 1 hour and up to 12. Preheat broiler.
