Combine currants and water in small bowl. Let stand 30 minutes. Drain. Transfer currants to medium bowl. Cook escarole in batches in large pot of boiling water just until wilted, about 2 minutes. Drain; cool under cold running water. Drain again; squeeze to remove excess water. Combine with currants. Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic; sauté just until beginning to color, about 2 minutes. Add escarole mixture and pine nuts. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Sauté until escarole is heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
