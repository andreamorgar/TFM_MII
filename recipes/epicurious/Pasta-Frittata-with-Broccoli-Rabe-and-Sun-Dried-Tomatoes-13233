Put oven rack in upper third of oven and preheat oven to 400°F. Cook pasta in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water according to package instructions; 2 minutes before pasta is done cooking, add broccoli rabe and cook 2 minutes. Drain pasta and broccoli rabe and pat dry. Heat oil in a 10-inch heavy ovenproof nonstick skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking. Add pasta, broccoli rabe, and tomatoes and sauté, stirring frequently, 2 minutes. Whisk together eggs, cheese, milk, salt, and pepper and pour over pasta mixture. Transfer skillet to oven and bake until frittata is set (eggs should be just firm), 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer frittata to a cutting board and cut into wedges.
