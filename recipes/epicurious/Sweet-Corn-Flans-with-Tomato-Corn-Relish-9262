Preheat oven to 350°F. Cook corn in a pot of boiling water until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and cool. Cut off kernels with a sharp knife into a bowl, scraping ears. Reserve 3/4 cup for relish and purée remainder in a blender with milk until smooth. Force corn purée through a fine sieve into a bowl, discarding skins. Whisk together eggs, salt, and cayenne until blended and whisk in corn purée. Pour flan mixture into lightly oiled ramekins and bake in a hot-water bath just until set, about 40 minutes. Remove ramekins from water bath and cool on a rack. Chill until cold, about 2 hours. Stir together corn, tomatoes, onion, and basil. Stir in oil and vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Run a thin knife around edge of each flan, then invert flans onto plates. Spoon relish over them.
