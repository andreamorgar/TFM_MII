Let syrup cool completely. Whisk first 7 ingredients in large bowl to blend. Whisk yogurt, eggs, and brandy in medium bowl to blend. Stir yogurt mixture into dry ingredients (batter will be very soft). Pour oil into heavy large saucepan to depth of 1 1/2 inches. Attach deep-fry thermometer and heat oil to 350°F to 360°F. Line large rimmed baking sheet with several layers of paper towels. Frying 3 or 4 at a time, drop batter by heaping tablespoonfuls into oil and cook until deep golden brown, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer fritters to paper towels to drain. Sift powdered sugar over fritters. Spoon syrup into bowls. Arrange 3 fritters atop syrup in each.
