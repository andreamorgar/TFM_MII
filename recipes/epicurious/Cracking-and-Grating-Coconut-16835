Extracting the meat from a coconut is not as difficult as you may think. Pierce several of the coconut’s eyes with a screwdriver or sharp metal skewer. Drain the thin, clear liquid into a bowl and taste it: If it's oily rather than sweet, the nut is rancid and should be tossed out. Bake the whole coconut in a shallow baking pan at 400°F until it cracks, about 20 minutes. When it's cool, wrap it in a towel and break it apart with a hammer. Pry the flesh from the shell with a screwdriver or a dull table knife and peel off the brown membrane with a vegetable peeler. Rinse the coconut under cold water and dry. Grate the coconut, using the medium shredding disk of a food processor or the medium teardrop-shaped holes of a four-sided grater, and chill, covered, until ready to use. —
