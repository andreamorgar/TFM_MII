Put butter in small flameproof roasting pan and put pan in oven. Preheat oven to 450°F. Pat chicken dry and sprinkle with thyme and salt and pepper to taste. Put chicken, skin sides down, in hot butter and arrange carrots, onion, and lemon around chicken. Season vegetables with salt. Roast chicken and vegetables 10 minutes. Turn chicken sides up and put 3 prunes under each half. Roast chicken and vegetables, stirring vegetables once halfway through cooking time, 15 minutes more, or until chicken is cooked through and vegetables are tender. Remove pan from oven and with slotted spoon transfer chicken, vegetables, lemon, and prunes to a platter. In measuring cup or small bowl stir together broth, wine, flour, and parsley. Add mixture to pan and broil over high heat, stirring and scraping up browned bits, 1 minute, or until thickened slightly. Pour sauce over chicken and vegetables and garnish with parsley sprigs.
