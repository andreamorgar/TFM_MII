Mix first 5 ingredients in a medium bowl until well blended. Season herb butter to taste with salt and pepper. Build a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to high. Place clams on grill rack and cover grill with lid. Grill until clams just open, 6-8 minutes (discard any that do not open). Use tongs to transfer to a platter, being careful to keep as much juice in the shells as possible. Dot clams with herb butter; let stand until butter melts. Serve warm with lemon wedges alongside for squeezing over.
