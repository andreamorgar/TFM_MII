In a fine sieve let the yogurt drain, covered and chilled, for 40 minutes. While the yogurt is draining, in a small saucepan combine the sugar, the cinnamon, and 3/4 cup water and boil the mixture for 5 minutes. Stir in the pineapple, simmer the mixture, covered, for 8 minutes, and transfer the pineapple with a slotted spoon to a metal bowl. Boil the syrup until it is reduced to about 1/2 cup, add the rum, and boil the syrup for 1 minute. Pour the syrup over the pineapple and chill the mixture, set in a larger bowl of ice and cold water. Divide the yogurt cheese between 2 bowls and spoon the pineapple mixture over it.
