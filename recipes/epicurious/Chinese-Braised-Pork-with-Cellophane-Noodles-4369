Choose the piece of pork with as much lean meat as you can find. Wash and pat dry with paper towel. Leave the rind on. Cut into 1" cubes. Place in heavy saucepan. Add enough boiling water to cover. Bring to a boil. Cook uncovered 10 minutes. Drain and rinse meat. Return meat to pan. Add all remaining ingredients except cellophane noodles. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer covered for an hour. While the pork is simmering soak cellophane noodles in 2 cups hot water. After 1 hour add noodles to pork. Cover and simmer until pork can be very easily pierced with a chopstick or fork.
