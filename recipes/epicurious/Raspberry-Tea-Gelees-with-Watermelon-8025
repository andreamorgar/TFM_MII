In a saucepan bring sugar with 2 cups water to a boil over moderately high heat and boil, stirring, until sugar is dissolved. Add tea bags and remove pan from heat. Steep tea 5 minutes and remove tea bags, carefully squeezing any liquid in them into pan. In small bowl sprinkle gelatin over 1/4 cup ice water and let stand 1 minute to soften. Stir gelatin mixture into hot tea over low heat until gelatin is dissolved completely. Remove pan from heat and stir in remaining 3/4 cup ice water and lemon juice. Chill mixture 45 minutes, or until thickened to the consistency of raw egg white, and stir in watermelon and mint leaves. Rinse six 1-cup molds in cold water, shaking out excess water (do not dry). Spoon mixture into molds and chill until set, about 2 hours. Dip each mold into warm water to loosen and invert gelées onto dessert plate. Garnish gelées with mint sprigs.
