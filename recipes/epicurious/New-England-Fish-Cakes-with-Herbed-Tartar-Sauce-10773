Stir together tartar sauce, 2 tablespoons green onions, 2 teaspoons thyme, and capers in small bowl. Place white bread in food processor; using on/off turns, process until very coarse crumbs form. Transfer breadcrumbs to large bowl. Using on/off turns, finely chop celery; add to bowl with breadcrumbs. Using on/off turns, coarsely puree fish; add to bowl. Add remaining 1/2 cup chopped green onions, 1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme, egg, salt, and ground black pepper to bowl. Mix gently but thoroughly. Transfer fish mixture to work surface and shape into four 1/2-inch-thick cakes. Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add fish cakes and cook until brown on bottom, about 5 minutes. Using large spatula, carefully turn fish cakes over and cook until second sides are brown and centers are opaque, about 5 minutes longer. Divide fish cakes among 4 plates and garnish with tartar sauce and lemon wedges.
