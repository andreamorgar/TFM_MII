In a small bowl toss the beef well with the lemon juice, add the flour, and toss the beef until it is coated with the flour. In a heavy skillet heat the butter over moderately high heat until the foam subsides and in it brown the beef. Transfer the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl and in the fat remaining in the skillet cook the onion and the mushrooms over moderate heat, stirring, until they are just tender. Add the wine, simmer the mixture for 1 minute, and stir in the consommé, the paprika, and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer the mixture, stirring, for 3 minutes, stir in the beef and the juices that have accumulated in the bowl, and cook the stew until the beef is heated through. Serve the stew over the noodles.
