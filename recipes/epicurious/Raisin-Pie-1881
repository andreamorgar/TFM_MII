Beat the egg yolks and beat in the buttermilk and vinegar. Add the sugar, flour, salt and grated rinds and mix well. Drain the raisins and add to the mixture. Line a 9" pan with pastry and add the filling. Top with crust and cut a vent. Brush with beaten egg. Bake in a 450°F. oven for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350°F. and continue baking until the crust is nicely browned. Serve while still warm.
