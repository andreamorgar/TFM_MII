In a small bowl whisk together the garlic paste, the grapefruit juice, the vinegar, and the mustard, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. Whisk in the parsley and salt and pepper to taste. In a large bowl toss together the romaine, the arugula, the fennel, the radishes, and the dressing, add the Parmesan and the grapefruit sections, cut into 1-inch pieces, and toss the salad gently.
