Using vegetable peeler, remove peel (orange part only) of clementines; chop peel. Remove any remaining pith from clementines and cut flesh into 1/4-inch pieces. Combine chopped peel and flesh in small bowl and set aside. Bring chickpeas with liquid to boil in saucepan. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until chickpeas are heated through, about 3 minutes.
