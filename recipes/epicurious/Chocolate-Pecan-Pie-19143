Butter an 8" pie tin with the softened butter and press in the chopped nuts. Combine the syrup, eggs, salt and vanilla and beat well. Melt the chocolate bits over hot water and add them slowly to the syrup mixture, stirring constantly. Pour into the pie shell and sprinkle with coarsely broken pecans. Bake in a 350°F. oven for 25-30 minutes. Serve with vanilla-flavored whipped cream.
