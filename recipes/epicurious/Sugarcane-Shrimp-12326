Wash the shrimp and place them in a large bowl. Combine the lime juice, soy sauce, rum, oil, sugar, and garlic in a second bowl. Season with salt, pepper, and habanero. Cover with plastic wrap and allow the shrimp to marinate while preheating the broiler. When ready, thread 1 pineapple chunk, 1 shrimp, then a second pineapple chunk on each skewer. Place the skewers on a broiler pan and cook until lightly browned, turning once, 3 to 5 minutes.
