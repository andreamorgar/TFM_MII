Bring broth and wine to boil in heavy large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add chicken, asparagus and peas. Reduce heat and simmer until chicken is almost cooked through and vegetables are crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Add green onions and marjoram. Simmer until chicken is cooked through and flavors blend, about 2 minutes longer. Mix 1/4 cup Parmesan into soup; season with salt and pepper. Ladle soup into bowls. Serve, passing remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan.
