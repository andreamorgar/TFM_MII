Peel and segment the grapefruit over a bowl and reserve any juices that drip from them. Heat a skillet and add 2 teaspoons of the oil, then add the grapes and cook over high heat to blister them slightly, shaking the pan often to cook them evenly. Add the grapefruit juice and cook until it's almost evaporated, then add the honey and bring to a boil; tip into a bowl and leave to cool. When the grapes are cool, add the grapefruit segments, raspberries, and remaining oil, and gently toss. Mix the mint into the yogurt. To serve, spoon the fruit salad into 4 small bowls and dollop the minted yogurt on top.
