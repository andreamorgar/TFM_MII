Freeze pork, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, 30 minutes, to facilitate slicing. Cut pork crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick slices and season with salt and pepper. Mince garlic and in a small bowl stir together with remaining sauce ingredients until combined. Halve onion lengthwise and cut into thin slices. Diagonally cut beans into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Core cabbage and cut into 1-inch pieces. Chop coriander. Heat a wok or large heavy skillet over high heat until a bead of water dropped on cooking surface evaporates immediately. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons peanut oil, swirling wok or skillet to coat evenly, and heat until hot but not smoking. Add onion and stir-fry until slightly softened. Add beans and stir-fry until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Transfer mixture to a large bowl. Add 1 tablespoon peanut oil to wok or skillet and stir-fry cabbage until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Add bean sprouts and stir-fry until sprouts are slightly wilted, about 30 seconds. Transfer cabbage mixture to bowl. Add 1 tablespoon peanut oil to wok or skillet and heat until just smoking. Stir-fry half of pork, separating slices, until browned and transfer to bowl. Add remaining tablespoon peanut oil and stir-fry remaining pork, transferring to bowl. Add sauce to wok or skillet and bring to a boil, stirring. Return pork-vegetable mixture to wok or skillet and stir-fry until heated through. Stir in coriander, snow-pea shoots or daikon sprouts, sesame oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Serve stir-fry over rice.
