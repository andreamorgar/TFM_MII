In a large heavy kettle cook the onions and the garlic in the oil over moderate heat, stirring, until the onions are softened, add the chili powder, the cumin, the cayenne, and the cinnamon, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the beef, the water, the broth , the tomato purée, and the salt and simmer the mixture, uncovered, adding more water if necessary to keep the beef barely covered, for 1 1/2 hours. Add the raisins, the olives, and the jalapeño and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes, or until the beef is tender. Stir in the beans, simmer the chili for 5 minutes, or until the beans are heated through, and stir in the coriander. The chili may be frozen or made 4 days in advance, cooled, uncovered, and kept covered and chilled.
