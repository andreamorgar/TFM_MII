Place porcini in medium bowl. Pour hot water over. Let stand until porcini are soft, about 30 minutes. Remove from water; squeeze any liquid back into bowl. Chop porcini. Reserve soaking liquid. Preheat broiler. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic; stir 10 seconds. Add porcini and 1/2 cup reserved soaking liquid, leaving any sediment in bottom of bowl. Add brandy; simmer until almost all liquid evaporates, about 3 minutes. Add scallops and chives; sautée until scallops are almost cooked through, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer scallop mixture to 9-inch round gratin dish. Sprinkle breadcrumbs over. Broil until breadcrumbs are golden, watching closely to avoid burning, about 3 minutes. Serve hot.
