In a large bowl stir together scallion, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, capers, and salt and pepper to taste. Add turkey, combining mixture well, and form into twelve 1-inch-thick patties. Burgers may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Prepare grill. Grill burgers on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 6 minutes on each side, or until cooked through. Serve burgers with ketchup and mustards on bread.
