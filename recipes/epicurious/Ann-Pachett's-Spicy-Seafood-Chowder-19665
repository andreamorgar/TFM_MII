Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-heat. Add onion, celery, and green pepper; sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; sauté 1 minute. Add basil, thyme, oregano, and dried crushed red pepper; sauté 1 minute. Stir in bottled clam juice and tomato sauce; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly thickened, about 30 minutes. (Broth can be prepared 1 day ahead. Refrigerate uncovered until cold, then cover and keep refrigerated. Rewarm over low heat before continuing.) Meanwhile, cook orzo in pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain. Rinse under cold water until cool. Drain well. Add shrimp and scallops to broth; simmer until shrimp are just opaque in center, about 3 minutes. Stir in orzo and clams with juices; simmer until clams are just heated through. Divide chowder among 4 bowls. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.
