Divide cod between 2 large bowls and cover with cold water by 2 inches. Soak cod, chilled, changing water 3 times a day, up to 3 days (see note below). Refrigerate until ready to use. Drain cod and transfer to a 6- to 8-quart pot with water, onion, thyme, bay leaves, and peppercorns. Bring just to a simmer and remove from heat. (Cod will just flake; do not boil or it will become tough.) Gently transfer cod with a slotted spoon to a platter, discarding cooking liquid and seasonings. Serve warm or at room temperature.
