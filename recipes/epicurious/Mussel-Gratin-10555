Preheat oven to 450°F. Toss together mussels, tomatoes, basil, crème fraîche, cheese, minced garlic, salt, and pepper in an oiled 3-quart (about 13- by 9 1/2- by 2-inch) baking dish. Rub 1 cut side of each bread slice with halved garlic and arrange bread, garlic side up, over mussel mixture in baking dish. Brush tops of bread with oil. Bake gratin in middle of oven until bread is golden brown on top, about 15 minutes. Serve mussels spooned over garlic toasts.
