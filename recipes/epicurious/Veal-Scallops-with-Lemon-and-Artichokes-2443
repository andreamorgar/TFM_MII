Dredge the veal in the flour, shaking off the excess. In a large heavy skillet heat the oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter over moderately high heat until the foam subsides, in the fat sauté the veal in batches for 45 seconds on each side, or until it is golden, transferring it as it is cooked to a heated platter, and keep it warm. To the skillet add the lemon juice and the broth and simmer the mixture, stirring and scraping up the brown bits, for 2 minutes. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a small saucepan, add the artichokes, and simmer the sauce for 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, swirl in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, and season the sauce with salt and pepper. Divide the veal among 4 heated plates and nap it with the sauce.
