Bring rice and water to a boil in a 2 1/2-quart heavy saucepan, then reduce heat to low and cook, tightly covered, until water is absorbed and rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 5 minutes. Gently stir rice from top to bottom of saucepan with a heatproof rubber spatula. Cook bacon in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until golden and crisp, about 6 minutes. Pour into a sieve set over a heatproof bowl and reserve bacon and fat separately. Whisk together eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl. Return 3 tablespoons fat to skillet and sauté onion over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until pale golden, about 5 minutes. Add eggs and cook, stirring, until eggs are just set, about 1 minute. Make a well in center of egg mixture, then pour in vegetable oil and 2 tablespoons reserved bacon fat. Add rice, remaining teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add bacon, scallions, and sesame oil and cook mixture, stirring, 1 minute. Serve immediately.
