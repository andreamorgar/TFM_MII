Carefully remove vanilla beans and scrape the softened seeds from the pods back into the saucepan; discard pods. 2. Place yolks in a bowl and whisk constantly, slowly pouring in 1 cup of the hot-milk mixture. Continue to whisk until smooth. 3. Slowly pour the egg mixture into the saucepan, whisking constantly until well combined. Place saucepan over medium heat and stir constantly until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon (6 to 8 minutes); it should never boil. Strain mixture into a bowl.
