Char bell peppers over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides. Enclose in paper bag; let stand 10 minutes. Peel and seed bell peppers. Cut all bell peppers into matchstick-size strips. Set aside. Arrange tomatoes on baking sheet. Broil until tomatoes begin to brown and blister, about 5 minutes. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add scallops and cook 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Turn scallops over. Add lime juice to skillet, then tequila. Simmer until scallops are cooked through and liquid is reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer scallops to plate. Stir roasted peppers, tomatoes, cilantro and basil into cooking liquid. Add butter 1 piece at a time, whisking just until melted. Return scallops to skillet. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon scallop mixture onto plates. Sprinkle with diced avocado and mango. Garnish with cilantro sprigs.
