Working in batches and using meat mallet, pound veal scallops between sheets of plastic wrap into thin ovals, each about 3 to 4 inches wide. Sprinkle both sides of scallops lightly with salt. Mix 4 tablespoons butter and parsley in small bowl. Spread 1 teaspoon butter mixture evenly over 1 side of each veal scallop. Starting at short sides, roll up veal, enclosing butter mixture. Fasten ends of veal scallops with toothpicks to secure. Spread flour on plate. Whisk eggs, garlic, 1 teaspoon coarse salt, cinnamon, pepper, cloves, and nutmeg in medium bowl to blend. Dredge veal scallops in flour; shake off excess. Melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter with oil in heavy large skillet over medium-low heat until butter foams but is not brown, about 3 minutes. Turn veal rolls in egg mixture to coat well and add to skillet. Increase heat to medium-high and cook until rolls are browned on all sides and cooked through, turning frequently, about 10 minutes. Transfer to work surface; remove toothpicks. Cut rolls crosswise into slices. Divide veal roulades among plates and serve.
