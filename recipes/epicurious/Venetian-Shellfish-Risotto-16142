Make a rich fish stock with the shells, fish bones and heads. Follow the recipe for risotto but add chopped garlic with the onion, and cook the rice in the strained fish broth. Heat the cooked shellfish in 4 tablespoons butter, season to taste and toss with the chopped parsley. Mix into the cooked risotto and add the remaining butter and grated Parmesan cheese.
