Place pork sparerib cubes and pork fat in freezer until partially frozen, about 30 minutes. Place half of pork and half of pork fat in processor. Using on/off turns, blend mixture until finely ground. Transfer mixture to bowl. Repeat with remaining pork and pork fat. Gently mix sage and next 5 ingredients into ground pork mixture. Stir in 1/4 cup beer. Cover and chill overnight. Form pork mixture by tablespoonfuls into 1 1/4-to 1 1/2-inch-diameter patties; place on baking sheet. DO AHEAD: Can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover and chill. Heat large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Working in batches if necessary, add sausage patties to skillet and cook until browned on bottom, about 5 minutes. Add remaining 1/2 cup beer to skillet; cover with lid slightly ajar and cook until beer evaporates, 6 to 7 minutes. Turn patties over and cook until brown on bottom and cooked through, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer sausage patties to platter. Serve with Beer and Horseradish Mustard and soft pretzels.
