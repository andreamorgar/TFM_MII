Cut the tomatoes in halves. In a frying pan melt a lump of butter. Put in the tomatoes, cut side downward. With a sharply pointed knife, puncture the rounded sides of the tomatoes here and there. Let them heat for five minutes, then turn them over. Sprinkle with salt. Cook them for another 10 minutes. Turn them again. The juices run out and spread into the pan. Once more, turn the tomatoes cut side upward. Put about 3 ounces of thick cream around them in the pan, mixing it with the juices. As soon as it bubbles, slip the tomatoes and all their sauces onto a hot dish. Serve instantly.
