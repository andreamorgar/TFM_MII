Cut zucchini into thin rounds with slicer. Fit slicer with julienne attachment and cut potatoes into 1/4-inch-thick matchsticks. Start cooking rotini in a pasta pot of boiling salted water (3 tablespoons salt for 6 quarts water) according to package instructions. Six minutes before pasta is done, stir in potatoes and green beans. Two minutes before pasta is done, stir in corn and zucchini. Meanwhile, heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over high heat until it shimmers. Add tomatoes and cook, covered, shaking skillet once or twice, until tomatoes wilt, split, and release some juices, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and scoop into a small bowl. Reserve 1 cup pasta-cooking water, then drain pasta with vegetables. Put pesto in a large bowl and whisk in enough reserved cooking water to thin to a sauce, 1/3 to 1/2 cup. Add pasta mixture and toss to coat. Thin with more cooking water and season with salt if necessary. Serve immediately, with tomatoes and bread crumbs on the side.
