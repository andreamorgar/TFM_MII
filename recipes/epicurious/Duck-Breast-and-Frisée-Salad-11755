Put oven rack in middle of oven and preheat oven to 375°F. Toss bread with oil and kosher salt and spread in 1 layer in a large shallow baking pan, then bake until golden, about 12 minutes. Whisk together Sherry vinegar, mustard, pepper, and salt to taste in a large bowl, then add oil in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified. Fry duck slices in 2 batches in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, turning over once, until browned, about 3 minutes per batch (use caution; fat will splatter). Transfer duck breast bacon with tongs to a paper-towel-lined platter and loosely cover with foil to keep warm. Fill a deep 10-inch skillet with 1 1/4 inches cold water. Add distilled vinegar and bring to a simmer. Break 1 egg into a cup, then slide egg into simmering water. Repeat with remaining eggs, spacing them in skillet, and poach at a bare simmer until whites are firm but yolks are still runny, 2 to 3 minutes. Gently transfer eggs with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and season with salt and pepper. Toss frisée and croutons with dressing. Serve salad topped with duck bacon and eggs.
