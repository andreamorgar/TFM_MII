Preheat oven to 450°F. Toss sweet potatoes and oil on a foil-lined large rimmed baking sheet; season with salt and pepper. Roast, turning once, until golden brown and crisp, 25-30 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk mayonnaise, lime zest, and juice in a small bowl. Season fries with salt, top with cilantro, and serve with lime mayo for dipping.
