Sprinkle gelatin over 1/4 cup apple juice in a 2-quart saucepan and let soften 1 minute. Stir in horseradish, salt, and remaining 2 3/4 cups juice. Heat over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until gelatin is dissolved. Pour through a fine-mesh sieve into a metal bowl, pressing on and then discarding solids. Quick-chill by putting bowl in a larger bowl of ice and cold water, stirring occasionally, until aspic begins to thicken, 10 to 15 minutes. While aspic is chilling, chop enough fennel fronds to measure 1 tablespoon, then discard stalks. Cut bulb (half) into 1/4-inch dice. Toss apple, diced fennel, and fronds with lemon juice, then divide among ramekins. Ladle aspic into ramekins and chill, covered, until set, about 2 hours. Run a knife around aspic and invert ramekins onto plates to unmold.
