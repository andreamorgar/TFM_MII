In a steamer set over boiling water steam the parsnips, covered, for 8 minutes, or until they are tender. While the parsnips are steaming, put the butter, the parsley, and the thyme in a heatproof serving bowl. Add the hot parsnips and toss them with the butter mixture, the lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste.
