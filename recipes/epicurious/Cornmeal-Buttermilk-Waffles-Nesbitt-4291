Into a large bowl sift together flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Repeat sifting 2 more times and stir in wheat germ. In another large bowl whisk together eggs, buttermilk, and oil. Add flour mixture all at once and whisk just until combined. Preheat a waffle iron and preheat oven to 200 °F. Brush waffle iron lightly with additional oil. Spoon batter into waffle iron, using 1/4 cup batter for each 4-inch-square standard waffle and spreading batter evenly, and cook according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer waffle to a baking sheet and keep warm, uncovered, in middle of oven. Make more waffles with remaining batter in same manner, brushing waffle iron with mire oil before adding each batch. Serve waffles with syrup.
