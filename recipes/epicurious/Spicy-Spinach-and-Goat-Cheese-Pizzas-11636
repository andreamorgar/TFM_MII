Preheat oven to 425°F. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add spinach; toss until beginning to wilt, about 2 minutes. Add rosemary and crushed pepper and toss 1 minute. Remove from heat; mix in lemon juice and peel. Arrange crusts on work surface. Spread 1/4 of goat cheese on each. Top each with half of spinach mixture, then drop remaining goat cheese over spinach by teaspoonfuls. Place pizzas directly onto oven rack. Bake until crusts are crisp and cheese on top begins to brown, about 10 minutes.
