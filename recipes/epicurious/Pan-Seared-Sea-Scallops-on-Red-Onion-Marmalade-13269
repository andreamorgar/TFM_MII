Preheat oven to 250°F. Toss scallops, 2 tablespoons oil, lemon peel, and ginger in medium bowl. Heat large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add scallops; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook until brown and just opaque in center, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer scallops to small baking sheet; place in oven to keep warm. Add 3 tablespoons oil to drippings in same skillet; place over high heat. Add onions; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover and cook until brown, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Add wine, vinegar, and sugar. Cook until onion marmalade is thick, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon marmalade onto plates. Top with scallops and any juices, then chives.
