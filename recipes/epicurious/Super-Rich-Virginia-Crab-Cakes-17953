In a bowl, combine crab meat and bread crumbs. In a small bowl, whisk eggs well and add cream, whisking. Add cream mixture, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, onion and salt and pepper to taste to crab mixture and combine well. In a large heavy skillet, heat 1 tablespoon butter over moderate heat until foam subsides and into it drop half of crab mixture by tablespoons. Cook crab cakes until golden brown, about 2 minutes, on each side, and repeat with remaining tablespoon butter and crab mixture. Serve crab cakes warm.
