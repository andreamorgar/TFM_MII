Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F. Prick potatoes several times with a fork and bake on a baking sheet until tender, about 1 hour. While potatoes are baking, cook cabbage in a 3-quart saucepan of boiling salted water until tender, 6 to 8 minutes, then drain well in a colander. Cool potatoes 20 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 450°F. Cut off top quarter lengthwise from cooled potatoes. Scoop flesh from tops into a bowl, then discard tops. Scoop flesh from potato bottoms into bowl, leaving 1/4-inch-thick shells, and mash flesh with a potato masher. Stir in milk, cabbage, beef, 5 tablespoons butter, and salt and pepper to taste. Spoon potato filling into shells, mounding it, then drizzle with remaining tablespoon butter and bake on baking sheet until heated through, 15 to 20 minutes.
