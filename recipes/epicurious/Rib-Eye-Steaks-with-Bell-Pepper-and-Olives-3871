In a heavy skillet heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it brown the steaks, patted dry and seasoned with salt and pepper, for 1 minute on each side. Reduce the heat to moderate, cook the steaks for 2 minutes more on each side for medium-rare meat, and transfer them to 2 plates. In the fat remaining in the skillet cook the garlic over moderately low heat, stirring, for 30 seconds, or until it is fragrant, add the bell pepper, and cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes, or until the bell pepper is softened. Stir in the olives, the vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute. Spoon the olive mixture over the steaks.
