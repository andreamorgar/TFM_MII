Lightly oil an 8-by-2 inch round cake pan and line with plastic wrap. Spread 1 1/4 cups salmon evenly in cake pan. In a bowl stir together remaining salmon, cucumber, dill, onion, sour cream, lemon juice, and zest until combined well. Put cold water in a small heatproof cup and sprinkle gelatin over it. Set cup in a saucepan and add enough water to pan to reach halfway up side of cup. Heat gelatin mixture over low heat until gelatin is dissolved and stir into salmon mixture. Season mixture with salt and pepper and spoon over salmon in cake pan. Chill mousse, covered with plastic wrap, at least 6 hours and up to 3 days. To unmold mousse, invert mousse onto plate. Loft off cake pan and peel off plastic wrap. Garnish mousse with cucumber ribbons and serve with toasts.
