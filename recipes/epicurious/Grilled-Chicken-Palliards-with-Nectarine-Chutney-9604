Prepare grill for cooking. Simmer nectarines, tomato, garlic, vinegar, brown sugar, curry powder, and salt, uncovered, in a 2-quart heavy saucepan, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened but still saucy, about 20 minutes. While chutney is cooking, sandwich chicken between sheets of plastic wrap and pound with flat side of a meat pounder or with a rolling pin until 1/4inch thick. Pat chicken dry and brush tops with oil, then season with salt and pepper. When the fire is hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack 1 to 2 seconds), place chicken, oiled sides down, on lightly oiled grill rack and grill 1 minute. Brush tops with oil and season with salt and pepper, then turn chicken over and grill until just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes more. Serve chicken with nectarine chutney.
