Grill or broil the skin side of the tomatoes until slightly charred (15 minutes on the grill, 8 minutes under the broiler). Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Set aside. 3. Halve the bread lengthwise and pull out some of the insides. Spread the mayonnaise on the bread. Arrange the roast beef evenly over the bottom half and lay the Brie diagonally over the meat.
