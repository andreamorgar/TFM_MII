Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 8-inch-diameter cake pan with 2-inch-high sides. Line bottom with parchment; butter paper. Dust pan with flour. Melt chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water. Remove from over water. Add butter 1 piece at a time, mixing until melted and smooth. Mix in sugar. Mix in eggs 1 at a time. Add flour, then walnuts and stir to combine. Transfer batter to prepared cake pan. Bake just until springy to touch, about 45 minutes. Cool cake in pan on rack 15 minutes. Turn out onto rack, remove paper and cool completely. Bring whipping cream, slivovitz and light corn syrup to simmer in heavy medium saucepan. Reduce heat to low. Add semisweet chocolate and whisk until melted and smooth. Let glaze stand until cool but still pourable, whisking occasionally. Place cake on serving platter. Slide waxed paper under edges. Spread jam over top. Pour glaze over top and sides of cake. Smooth top and sides with spatula. Sprinkle walnuts in 1-inch border around top edge. Let stand until glaze sets. (Torte can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover tightly and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before serving.)
