Preheat oven to 375°F. Spray large baking sheet with cooking spray. Place squash and yams on prepared baking sheet, cut side down. Roast until very tender, about 1 hour. Cool slightly. Scoop out flesh and transfer to large saucepan. Mash with potato masher until smooth. Stir in broth and ras el hanout. Season puree to taste with salt and pepper. (Puree can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add onions, bell pepper, and sugar. Sauté until onions are golden brown and tender, about 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm before continuing.) Bring puree to simmer, adding more broth to thin if necessary. Stir in 3/4 of onion-bell pepper mixture. Transfer to serving bowl. Top with remaining onion-bell pepper mixture and serve.
