Separately cut carrots and cabbage into julienne strips. In a saucepan of boiling salted water cook carrots 2 minutes, or until just crisp-tender, and transfer with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Cook cabbage in boiling water 1 minute, or until just tender, and drain in a sieve. In a skillet melt butter over moderately high heat until foam subsides and in it sauté gingerroot, stirring, 30 seconds. Add carrots, cabbage, soy sauce, and sugar and sauté, stirring, 2 minutes.
