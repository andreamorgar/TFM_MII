Preheat oven to 250°F. Pat sauerkraut dry between paper towels to remove as much moisture as possible, then transfer to a bowl and stir in eggs, flour, scallion greens, salt, and pepper until combined. Heat 1/4 inch oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking. Fill a 1/4-cup measure three-fourths full with sauerkraut mixture, then turn out into oil, using a fork to release, and flatten to 3 1/2 inches in diameter with fork. Form 2 more cakes in skillet, then fry, turning over once, until golden, about 4 minutes total. Transfer cakes with a slotted spatula to paper towels to drain. Keep cakes warm on a rack set in a shallow baking pan in oven. Fry more cakes in same manner with remaining mixture. Brown kielbasa in 2 batches in oil remaining in skillet over moderate heat, turning, 2 minutes per batch, then transfer to paper towels to drain. Serve cakes topped with kielbasa.
