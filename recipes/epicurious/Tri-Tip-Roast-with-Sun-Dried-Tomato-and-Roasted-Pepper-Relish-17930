Roast bell pepper on rack of a gas burner over high heat (or broil 2 to 3 inches from heat), turning with tongs, until skin is blackened, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and tightly cover, then let stand 20 minutes. Peel, then discard stem and seeds. Chop pepper and return to bowl. Mince and mash garlic to a paste with a pinch of salt, then stir into roasted pepper with sun-dried tomatoes, 1 tablespoon oil, capers, zest, juice, fennel seeds, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Preheat oven to 425°F with rack in middle. Pat beef dry and season with 1 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Heat remaining tablespoon oil in an ovenproof 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then sear beef until underside is browned, about 4 minutes. Turn meat over and transfer skillet to oven. Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted 2 inches into center of meat registers 125°F for medium-rare, 20 to 25 minutes. Let beef rest on a cutting board, uncovered, about 15 minutes (temperature will rise to between 130 and 135°F). Add roasted-pepper mixture to meat juices in hot skillet, scraping up brown bits. Transfer to a serving bowl and stir in parsley and basil. Serve sliced beef with roasted-pepper relish.
