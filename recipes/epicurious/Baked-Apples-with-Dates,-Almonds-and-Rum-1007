Preheat oven to 350°F. Mix 1/4 cup butter, rum and juice in 8 x 8 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Mix sugar, egg yolks, 1 tablespoon cream, ginger, flour, lemon peel and 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in small bowl until smooth. Mix in almonds and dates. Using melon baller, scoop out stem end and entire core of apples, being careful to leave bottom intact. Using vegetable peeler, remove 1-inch-wide strip of peel from around top of cavity. Pack cavities to top with almond mixture. Arrange apples in prepared dish. Brush exposed apple surfaces with additional melted butter. Bake until tester inserted into apple meets little resistance, brushing occasionally with juices and covering loosely with foil if filling is browning too quickly, about 45 minutes. Serve warm with whipped cream.
