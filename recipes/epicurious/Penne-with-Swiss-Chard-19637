Fill a 4-quart kettle three-fourths full with salted water and bring to a boil for pasta. Chop Swiss chard into 1/4-inch-wide pieces and finely chop separately red pepper flakes and onion. In a 12-inch heavy skillet cook onion in butter over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add Swiss chard and cook, stirring, 15 minutes, or until tender. While Swiss chard mixture is cooking, cook pasta in boiling water until al dente and drain in a colander. Add pasta to Swiss chard mixture with red pepper flakes, cream, and nutmeg and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat and stir in Parmesan and salt and pepper to taste.
