Mix flour, sugar, ground cinnamon and ground nutmeg in medium bowl. Add chilled butter and rub with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add shredded coconut and sliced almonds and rub mixture with fingertips until small clumps form. (Topping can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Preheat oven to 375° F. Butter 13 x 9x2-inch glass baking dish. Toss pears, cherries, sugar, flour and spices in large bowl. Transfer to prepared dish. Dot with butter. Sprinkle topping over. Bake until topping browns and juices thicken, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly. Serve with ice cream.
