Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 350°F. Using sharp knife, cut parallel lines 1 inch apart in fat layer and rind on ham. Cut more lines in crosswise direction, making diamond pattern. Stick 1 whole clove into center of each diamond. Place rack in roasting pan. Place ham on rack. Roast ham 2 hours. Reduce oven temperature to 300°F. Continue to roast ham until golden, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, combine mango nectar and next 6 ingredients in heavy medium saucepan. Bring to simmer over medium heat. Cook until glaze thickens and coats spoon, stirring often, about 14 minutes; set glaze aside. Remove ham from oven. Maintain oven temperature. Using pastry brush, dab all of glaze over ham, being careful not to dislodge crisp diamonds of fat and rind. Return ham to oven. Roast until ham is heated through and glaze is brown, about 35 minutes. Transfer ham to platter; let stand 15 minutes. Spoon chutney into bowl. Slice ham and serve with chutney.
