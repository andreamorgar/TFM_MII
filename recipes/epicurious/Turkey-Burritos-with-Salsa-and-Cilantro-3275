Preheat oven to 300°F. Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and bell peppers; sauté until tender and golden, about 15 minutes. Add turkey, salsa, and cumin; stir until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in cheese and cilantro; season generously with salt and pepper. Remove from heat; cover to keep warm. Working with 1 tortilla at a time, heat tortilla directly over medium-high gas flame (or in dry skillet over medium-high heat) until warm, softened, and browned in spots, about 30 seconds per side. Place tortilla on work surface. Spoon 1 cup warm turkey mixture along center of tortilla; fold sides in over filling, then roll up tortilla to enclose filling. Place burrito seam side down on baking sheet, and place in oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
