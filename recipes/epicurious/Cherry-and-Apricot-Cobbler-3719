Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss all ingredients in large bowl to blend. Transfer to 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Bake until filling is hot and begins to bubble at edges, about 35 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375°F. Whisk flour, 1/2 cup sugar and next 3 ingredients in another large bowl to blend. Add butter; rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal. Slowly add buttermilk and cream, tossing with fork until dough comes together. Drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls over hot filling to cover. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Continue to bake cobbler until topping is golden and tester inserted into center of topping comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool 15 minutes. Serve cobbler warm with whipped cream or ice cream.
