Preheat oven to 350°F. and butter and flour an 8-inch square baking pan, knocking out excess flour. In a double boiler or metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water melt chocolate and butter, stirring, until smooth and remove top of double boiler or bowl from heat. Cool mixture to room temperature. In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat eggs and sugar until mixture is thickened and pale and beat in chocolate mixture and Sambuca. Into a bowl sift together flour, salt, and baking powder and beat into batter just until blended well. Spread batter evenly in pan and sprinkle evenly with pine nuts. Bake brownies in middle of oven 30 to 35 minutes, or until a tester comes out with crumbs adhering to it. Cool brownies completely in pan on a rack before cutting into 16 squares. Brownies keep, layered between sheets of wax paper in an airtight container at cool room temperature, 5 days.
