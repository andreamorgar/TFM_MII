Peel potatoes and cut into 3/4-inch pieces, then cook in a 3- to 4-quart saucepan of boiling salted water , uncovered, until just tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain in a colander. While potatoes are cooking, whisk together vinegar, mustard, salt, pepper, and sugar in a large heatproof bowl until combined, then stir in shallots and let stand until ready to use. Toss potatoes with vinegar mixture, then add oil and watercress, tossing gently to combine.
