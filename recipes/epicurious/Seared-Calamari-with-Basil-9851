Blanch basil in a small saucepan of boiling water 15 seconds, then drain in a sieve and rinse under cold water to stop cooking. Drain basil and squeeze out excess liquid, then purée in a blender with olive oil, water, lemon juice, and 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper until dressing is bright green and smooth, about 1 minute. Cut each body sac of calamari lengthwise along seam to open into a flat piece; rinse well. Pat calamari dry, then cut body sacs into 1-inch pieces and halve any large tentacles lengthwise. Toss beans, tomatoes, celery, and onion with 1/3 cup basil dressing, then gently toss with greens. Season with salt and lemon juice, then divide among 4 plates. Heat griddle over high heat until hot. Meanwhile, toss calamari with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Brush griddle with vegetable oil, then cook calamari in 1 layer, stirring occasionally with tongs, until browned in spots and just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Divide calamari among salads; drizzle with some of remaining dressing.
