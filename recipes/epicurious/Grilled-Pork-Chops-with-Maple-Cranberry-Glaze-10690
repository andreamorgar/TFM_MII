Mix all ingredients in small bowl. Mix first 8 ingredients in small saucepan. Bring to boil over medium heat, whisking until smooth. Cool to room temperature. Do ahead: Spice rub and glaze can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and store spice rub at room temperature. Cover and refrigerate glaze. Rewarm glaze just until pourable before using. Spray grill rack with nonstick spray and prepare barbecue (medium heat). Sprinkle spice rub generously over both sides of pork chops (about 1/2 tablespoon per side), pressing to adhere. Place pork chops on grill, cover, and cook 5 minutes per side. Brush generously with glaze. Move to cooler part of grill and continue to grill, uncovered, until cooked through, brushing frequently with glaze, about 3 minutes longer per side. *Available at specialty foods stores and from tienda.com.
