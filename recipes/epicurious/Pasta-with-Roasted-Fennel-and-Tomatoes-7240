Preheat oven to 375°F. Arrange fennel halves cut side down in 8 x 8 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Drizzle with 1 1/2 tablespoons oil. Roast until fennel is light brown and tender, about 45 minutes. Cool. Cut fennel into 1/2-inch pieces. Heat remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and garlic and sauté until onions are tender, about 6 minutes. Add tomatoes with juice, oregano and sugar; bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until thickened to sauce consistency, about 6 minutes. Add fennel and simmer 5 minutes longer. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, cook spaghettini in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain. Return pasta to same pot. Add sauce to pasta; toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to large bowl. Sprinkle with Parmesan and serve.
