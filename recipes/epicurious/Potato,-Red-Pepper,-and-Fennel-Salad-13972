Simmer potatoes in salted cold water to cover by 1 inch in a saucepan until tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water. When cool enough to handle, cut each potato into eighths. While potatoes are cooking, trim fennel stalks flush with bulb, discarding stalks, and chop enough fronds to measure 2 tablespoons. Core bulb and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Whisk together vinegar, oil, and salt and pepper to taste in a large bowl. Add warm potatoes, fennel bulb and fronds, and bell pepper, then toss well. Season with salt and pepper.
