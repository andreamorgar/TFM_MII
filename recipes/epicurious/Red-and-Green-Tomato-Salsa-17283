If using tomatillos, discard outer husks and rinse tomatillos under warm water. Chop tomatoes or tomatillos fine (there should be about 1 1/2 cups) and in a bowl stir together with remaining ingredients. Let salsa stand at room temperature 30 minutes. Salsa may be made 4 hours ahead and chilled, covered.
