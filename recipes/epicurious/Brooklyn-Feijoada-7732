In large bowl, combine beans and enough cold water to cover by 2 inches. Let soak in refrigerator overnight. Drain and set aside. In large heavy pot over moderately high heat, heat oil until hot but not smoking. Working in batches, brown pork loin, stew beef, beef short ribs, carne seca, sausage, bacon, and pork chops, turning occasionally, about 8 minutes per batch. Transfer browned meat to cutting board. Lower heat to moderately low, add onions and garlic to fat in pot, and sauté until onions are soft and translucent, about 8-10 minutes. Add beans, meat, salt, pepper, and chicken broth. Raise heat to high, bring to boil, then lower heat and simmer, covered, until meat is falling off bones, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Arrange beans in center of large serving platter and surround with meat.
