Preheat oven to 375 °F. Toss apples, cranberries, 2/3 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, cinnamon and nutmeg to blend in large bowl. Transfer to 8x8x2-inch glass baking dish. Let stand 15 minutes. Combine oats, brown sugar and remaining 2 tablespoons flour in medium. Add butter and stir until moist clumps form. Sprinkle topping over filling. Bake until topping is golden brown and filling bubbles, about 1 hour. Cool slightly. Serve warm or at room temperature with frozen yogurt.
