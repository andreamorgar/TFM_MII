1. Prepare the sauce. Combine all the ingredients in a medium-size bowl and set aside. 2. Prepare the chicken. Rinse the chicken under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels. Place on a plate. 3. Combine the salt, pepper, garlic powder, allspice, and paprika in a small bowl. Rub the spices into the chicken skin. 4. Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. When the oil is very hot, add the chicken pieces and brown, cooking for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Pour the sauce over the chicken and simmer, covered, over medium heat until the chicken is cooked through and very moist, 30 to 45 minutes. 5. Serve the chicken pieces over rice, with the sauce spooned on top.
