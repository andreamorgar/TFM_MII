Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over low heat. Add ham and bell pepper and sauté until light brown, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and dried red pepper; stir 1 minute. Remove from heat. Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Lightly brush baguette slices on both sides with oil. Grill bread until light brown on outside but soft on inside, about 2 minutes per side. Combine clams and wine in large pot. Cover and boil over high heat until clams begin to open, about 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer clams to 6 bowls, discarding any clams that do not open. Add liquid in pot to skillet with ham-bell pepper mixture. Bring to boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until liquid is slightly reduced, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in basil. Pour mixture over clams, dividing equally. Serve clams, passing grilled bread separately.
