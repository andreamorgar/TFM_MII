Bring salt, 1/2 cup sugar, and 2 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring to dissolve salt and sugar. Let syrup cool. Stir in rose water, if using, and pour mixture into a 13x9x2" baking pan, preferably metal. Freeze mixture until edges begin to set, 25–30 minutes. Using a fork, scrape to break up any frozen parts, then continue to freeze, scraping and breaking up mixture every 20–30 minutes, until it resembles fluffy shaved ice, 2–3 hours. Toss blackberries, lime juice, and remaining 2 tsp. sugar in a medium bowl. Let sit at room temperature, tossing occasionally, until berries soften slightly, 10–15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°F. Toast almonds on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, 5–8 minutes; let cool. Scoop granita into bowls, dividing evenly, and top with blackberries and some of their juices, toasted almonds, and mint leaves. Granita can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and keep frozen. Scrape to break up and fluff before serving.
