Run vegetable peeler down length of each carrot, shaving into ribbons. Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add lemon peel and ginger; stir 1 minute. Add carrots and bell peppers. Sauté until just tender, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, cook pasta in medium pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking liquid. Add pasta, 1/4 cup reserved cooking liquid, cheese, and lemon juice to skillet. Toss until sauce coats pasta, adding more cooking liquid if dry. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve.
