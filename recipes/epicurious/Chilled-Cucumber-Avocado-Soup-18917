In a large measuring cup combine the buttermilk and enough ice cubes to measure 1 1/2 cups total. In a blender blend the buttermilk mixture with half the cucumber, the avocado, peeled and pitted, the broth, the lemon juice, and the cumin until the mixture is smooth. Divide the soup between chilled bowls and stir half the remaining cucumber into each serving.
