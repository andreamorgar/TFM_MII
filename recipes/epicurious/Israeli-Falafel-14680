In food processor or blender, combine all ingredients and 1/4 cup water. Process into smooth paste. (DO AHEAD: Sauce can be made ahead and refrigerated, covered, up to 1 day.) In food processor, combine chickpeas, onion, garlic, parsley, cumin, coriander, salt, red pepper flakes, and baking soda. Pulse just until finely chopped and crumbly (mixture will resemble wet bread crumbs; do not overprocess into paste, or balls will be heavy). (DO AHEAD: Mixture can be made ahead and refrigerated, covered, up to 1 day.) In large shallow skillet over moderately high heat, heat 3 inches oil until thermometer registers 350°F. Using 2 teaspoons or falafel scoop, form mixture into approximately 1-inch-diameter balls or disks. Working in batches of 5, lower carefully into hot oil and fry, turning occasionally, until deep golden brown, about 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Repeat to fry remaining falafel, returning oil to 350°F between each batch.
