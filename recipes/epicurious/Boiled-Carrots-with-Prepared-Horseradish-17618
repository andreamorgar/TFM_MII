Cut 3 medium carrots into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Place in a small saucepan. Add water to cover, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and a grind or two of black pepper. Bring to boiling over high heat; boil until the carrots are tender—about 10 minutes. Drain in a colander and serve warm, with prepared horseradish on the side.
