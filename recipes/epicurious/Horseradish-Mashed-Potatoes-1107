Cook potatoes in large saucepan of boiling salted water until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid. Place in large microwave-safe bowl. Add 3 tablespoons oil. Mash until potatoes are smooth, adding remaining 1 tablespoon oil, if desired, and reserved cooking liquid by 1/4 cupfuls to moisten to desired consistency. Mix in horseradish. Season to taste with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Potatoes can be made up to 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm potatoes in microwave before continuing. Transfer potatoes to bowl and serve.
