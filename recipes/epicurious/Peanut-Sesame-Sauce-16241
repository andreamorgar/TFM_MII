Stir sugar, garlic, and ginger in heavy nonstick skillet to blend. Cook over medium heat without stirring until sugar melts and caramelizes to dark amber color, about 3 minutes. Scrape mixture out onto piece of parchment paper. Let mixture cool and harden, about 15 minutes. Place peanuts, sesame seeds, oil, chile, and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper in blender. Break up garlic mixture; add to blender. Puree until paste forms, scraping down sides of jar as needed (most sesame seeds will remain whole). Season sauce to taste with salt and cayenne pepper. Transfer to small bowl. (Peanut-Sesame Sauce can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before using.)
