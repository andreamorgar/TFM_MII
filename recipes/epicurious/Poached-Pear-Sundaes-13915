Bring water, honey and orange peel to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Add pears. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat until pears are tender but still firm, about 12 minutes. Refrigerate pears in poaching liquid until cold, about 3 hours. (Pears can be prepared 1 day ahead.) Slice pears. Arrange slices decoratively in 2 dishes. Top with 1 scoop vanilla ice cream. Drizzle chocolate syrup over. Garnish with whipped cream and grated chocolate.
