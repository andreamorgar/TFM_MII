In a small bowl whisk together the egg yolk, the water, the Parmesan, and the flour. In a bowl with an electric mixer beat the egg whites with the vinegar until they hold soft peaks, stir half the whites into the yolk mixture with the bread crumbs, and fold in the remaining whites gently but thoroughly. In a skillet heat 1/4 inch of the oil until it registers 350°F. on a deep-fat thermometer, into it drop the batter in batches by 1/4 teaspoons, and fry the puffs, turning them, for 1 minute, or until they are browned and crisp. Transfer the puffs as they are cooked with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. The puffs may be made 3 days in advance and kept in an airtight container.
