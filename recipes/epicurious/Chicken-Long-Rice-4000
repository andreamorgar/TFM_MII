Simmer chicken with salt and ginger in 2 quarts water in a 5-quart pot, partially covered, skimming froth occasionally, until very tender, about 40 minutes. Transfer chicken with tongs to a bowl, reserving broth. When chicken is cool, discard skin and bones and shred meat. Pour broth through a fine sieve into a bowl and clean pot. Return broth to pot with remaining 2 cups water, onion, bouillon cubes, and mushrooms and bring to a boil, covered. Add noodles and cook, covered, over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Turn off heat and let stand, covered, 30 minutes. Stir in chicken and heat until hot. Stir in scallion, pepper, and salt to taste.
