Cut peel, including all white pith, from oranges with a small sharp knife, then cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices and transfer to a large bowl (you should have about 4 cups). Peel jicama with a large sharp knife, then quarter lengthwise and cut crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices (you should have about 3 cups). Add to oranges along with onion, radishes, vinegar, and salt. Toss until combined, then chill, covered, at least 1 hour. Toss again before serving, sprinkled with pork rinds and peanuts.
