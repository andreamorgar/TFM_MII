Preheat oven to 450°F. Brush 1 side of each bread slice with butter and arrange slices, buttered sides up, on a baking sheet. Stir together sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle evenly over bread. Toast bread in middle of oven until crisp and golden brown on top, about 7 minutes. Halve toasts diagonally. Preheat broiler. Dip cut side of each plum half in maple syrup, then put plums, cut sides up, on a buttered broiler pan. Broil plums 4 to 5 inches from heat until golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Heat remaining syrup over moderate heat until hot. Serve plums on cinnamon toasts, drizzled with remaining syrup.
