Preheat broiler. Toss tomatoes, bell pepper, onion, and garlic with oil in a shallow (1-inch-deep) baking pan and broil about 4 inches from heat, turning occasionally, until lightly charred on all sides, about 10 minutes. Cool 10 minutes. Peel garlic and purée in a blender with roasted vegetables, lemon juice, red pepper flakes, and salt until smooth.
