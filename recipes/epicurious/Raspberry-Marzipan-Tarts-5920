Combine butter, sugar and salt in a bowl. Beat in egg, then flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until you get a shaggy dough (it holds together loosely, but it's not smooth or elastic). Dust a surface with flour, transfer dough to surface and, with lightly floured fingers, knead once or twice until a sticky dough forms. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate at least 40 minutes. Heat oven to 350°F. Divide dough in half; reserve half for Chocolate-Banana Tarts or freeze, well-wrapped, for another use. Divide remainder into 4 pieces. With lightly floured fingertips, press 1 piece into each tart pan, working dough up the sides evenly. (If dough tears on bottom, smooth dough over hole to close it up.) Prick pastry along bottom with a fork several times. Gently press a small square of foil into each pastry shell (do not press down hard). Top each with 1 tablespoon uncooked rice or dried beans (to prevent pastry from puffing up). Place on a baking sheet and bake 10 minutes. Remove foil and rice from each crust; discard. Return crust to oven; cook until golden, about 5 minutes more. Keep oven on. Combine butter and sugar. Beat in yolk, followed by flour, until combined. Beat in milk until incorporated. Divide filling among tart shells and bake until puffed, about 15 minutes. Heat preserves with 1 tablespoon water in a small sauté pan over low heat until melted, about 3 minutes. Press through a sieve into a bowl. Let cool. Arrange about 7 raspberries on top of each tart. Brush glaze onto raspberries and drizzle remaining glaze over raspberries until covered. Serve immediately.
