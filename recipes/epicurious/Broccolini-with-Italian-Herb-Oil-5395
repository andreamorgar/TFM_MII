Cook Broccolini in a 5-to 6-quarts pot of boiling salted water (2 teaspoons salt for 4 quarts water) until just tender, about 6 minutes, then drain. Meanwhile, blend herbs, garlic, anchovy paste, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a blender until finely chopped. With motor running, add oil in a slow stream, blending until mixture is green and herbs are very finely chopped. Serve Broccolini tossed with herb oil.
