Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle. Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk together dry ingredients, then whisk in remaining ingredients. Form 3 (9-by 4-inch) rectangles on 1 baking sheet: Use 3 tablespoons batter for each one and spread thinly and evenly with offset spatula, spacing rectangles 2 inches apart. Bake until set, 5 to 6 minutes, then cut each rectangle (on baking sheet) crosswise into 8 strips with a knife. Continue to bake until pale golden, 9 to 12 minutes more. Transfer crisps to a rack to cool. Spread and bake remaining batter in 2 batches (cool baking sheet first if necessary). When all crisps are cool, spread out in 1 layer on 2 baking sheets. Bake again, 1 sheet at a time, until deep golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool completely.
