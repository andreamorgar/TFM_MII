Preheat oven to 350°F. Line large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in large bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add 1 cup sugar; beat until thick and mixture resembles marshmallow creme, about 5 minutes. Beat in cornstarch and almond extract. Drop meringue onto prepared sheet in 6 mounds, spacing apart. Using spoon, make indentationin center of each. Sprinkle almonds over meringues. Place in oven; immediately reduce temperature to 250°F. Bake until meringues are dry outside but centers are still soft, about 45 minutes. Cool on sheet on rack 30 minutes. Meanwhile, stir apricots and 3/4 cup sugar in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves and apricots are soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in vanilla. Transfer to bowl; chill until cool. Stir in raspberries. Using electric mixer, beat cream with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar in medium bowl until peaks form. Place meringues on plates. Spoon whipped cream into center of each. Top with apricot mixture and serve.
