Quarter lettuce heads lengthwise, keeping stem ends attached. Carefully wash in cold water, then dry in a salad spinner. Whisk together vinegar, shallot, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper, then add oils in a slow stream, whisking until combined. Spoon vinaigrette over lettuce wedges, then scatter with nuts and cheese.
