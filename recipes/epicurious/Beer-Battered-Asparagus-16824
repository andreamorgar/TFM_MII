Stir together mayonnaise, lemon juice, zest, and pepper in a small bowl. Chill, covered, until ready to use. Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 200°F. Whisk together flour, salt, zest, and pepper in a bowl until combined, then add beer, whisking until smooth. Heat 3 inches oil in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan over moderately high heat until it registers 375°F on thermometer. Submerge asparagus spears in batter to coat. Working in batches of 10, drag 1 at a time gently against rim to remove excess batter, then transfer to oil and fry, stirring gently to keep asparagus from sticking together, until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer as fried with a slotted spoon to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet and keep warm in oven. Return oil to 375°F between batches. Serve with lemon dipping sauce.
