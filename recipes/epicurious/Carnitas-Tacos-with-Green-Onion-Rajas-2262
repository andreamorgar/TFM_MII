Place pork in heavy large pot. Add broth. Add enough water to cover pork by 1/2 inch. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium. Cover partially; simmer until meat is very tender and liquid is absorbed, about 1 hour 45 minutes. Cool slightly. Shred meat. Season with salt. Cover; keep warm. Meanwhile, melt butter in large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic; sauté 1 minute. Add bell peppers and poblanos; sauté until tender, about 12 minutes. Add green onions; sauté until tender, about 4 minutes. Add cheese and cream. Simmer until cheese melts and liquid thickens. Stir in cilantro. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon some shredded meat onto half of each warm tortilla. Top with pepper mixture. Fold tortilla over filling. Serve with lime wedges to squeeze over.
