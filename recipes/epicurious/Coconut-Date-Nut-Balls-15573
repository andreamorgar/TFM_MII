In a food processor blend the graham cracker crumbs, the dates, 1/2 cup of the coconut, and the honey until the mixture is just combined. Add the walnuts and blend the mixture until it forms a ball. Have ready in a shallow dish the remaining 3/4 cup coconut, form the date mixture into walnut-size balls, and roll the balls in the coconut, pressing the coconut slightly to make it adhere.
