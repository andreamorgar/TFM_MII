1. Preheat the oven to 425°F. 2. In a medium-sized bowl whisk together the squash and the egg yolks until combined. Whisk in the sugar and the salt and the milk, then whisk in the flour until smooth. 3. In another medium-size bowl, lightly whisk the egg whites to the soft peak stage. Whisk the egg whites lightly into the squash mixture, then pour it into the pre-baked pie shell. Sprinkle the cinnamon over the top and bake in the bottom third of the oven for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat of the oven to 350°F and continue baking until the pie is nearly set but still moves slightly, 25 to 30 minutes. Let it cool to room temperature before serving.
