Bring Sherry and raisins to a simmer in a small saucepan. Remove from heat; let cool. Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add almonds and cook, stirring frequently, until just beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute more. Add chard by handfuls to pot, tossing to wilt between additions, and cook until tender, about 4 minutes. Add raisins with soaking liquid, chile, lemon zest, and 2 teaspoons lemon juice. Season with salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired, and toss to combine.
