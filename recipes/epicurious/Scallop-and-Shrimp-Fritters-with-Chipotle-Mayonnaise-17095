Stir together mayonnaise, chiles, adobo sauce, and lemon juice in a small bowl, then season with salt. Purée scallops, egg white, shallot, salt, and pepper in a food processor. Add cream and pulse until just combined. Transfer mixture to a bowl and stir in shrimp. Chill, covered, 10 minutes. Put bread crumbs in a pie plate. Drop 6 (2-tablespoon) mounds of scallop mixture onto crumbs, then gently coat with crumbs and shape mounds into 3-inch patties. Transfer as coated to a wax-paper-lined tray. Make 6 more patties in same manner with remaining scallop mixture and crumbs. Heat 1/4 inch oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then fry patties in 2 batches, turning once, until golden and firm to the touch, about 4 minutes total. Drain on paper towels. Serve fritters with chipotle mayonnaise.
