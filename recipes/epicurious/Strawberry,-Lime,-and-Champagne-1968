In a small saucepan, combine the sugar with 1/2 cup water and simmer the mixture for 5 minutes, or until the sugar is dissolved. Let the sugar syrup cool completely. In a food processor, purée the strawberries with their syrup and the lime juice, transfer the mixture to a large punch bowl, forcing it through a fine sieve if desired, and stir in the sugar syrup, the brandy, and the club soda. Chill the mixture, covered, until it is cold. Add the champagne slowly just before serving and serve the punch in punch glasses, each garnished with a strawberry slice and a lime slice.
