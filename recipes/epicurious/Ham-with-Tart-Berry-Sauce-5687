Sprinkle ham generously with pepper. Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham and sauté until brown at edges, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer ham to plates; tent with foil to keep warm. Reduce heat to medium. Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter to same skillet. Add shallots and mustard and stir until shallots begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Mix in lingonberries, water and red wine vinegar. Stir until sauce thickens, about 1 minute; season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon sauce over ham and serve.
