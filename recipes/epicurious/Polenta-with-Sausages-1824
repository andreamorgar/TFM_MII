Cover the sausages with water, bring to a boil and simmer for 12 minutes. Drain thoroughly and return to the pan to brown. Turn the sausages once or twice to be sure they brown evenly on all sides. Oil an oval ovenproof serving dish and pour in the polenta. Top with the sausages and bake in a 375°F. oven for 15 minutes. Spoon a little tomato sauce over the sausages and polenta and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese. Serve with additional tomato sauce and cheese.
