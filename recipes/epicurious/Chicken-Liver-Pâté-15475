Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat until foam subsides. Add shallot and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Pat livers dry and add to skillet. Cook over medium-high heat, turning once, until browned and just pink inside, about 4 minutes total. Add quatre épices, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper and cook, stirring, 30 seconds. Add Cognac and tilt skillet over gas burner to ignite (or ignite with a long match; use caution as flames may shoot up high). Cook, shaking skillet gently once or twice, until flames subside. Transfer mixture to a food processor and pulse, adding remaining 6 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and chill, surface covered with plastic wrap, until set, about 3 hours. Let stand at room temperature about 15 minutes before serving.
