Preheat broiler. Line rack of broiler pan with foil and lightly oil foil with some olive oil. Pat fish dry and check for bones by running your hand over fish from thinnest to thickest end. Remove any bones with pliers. Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper, then broil 4 inches from heat 7 minutes. Cover fish loosely with foil and continue broiling until just cooked through, 7 to 9 minutes more. While salmon broils, whisk together all sauce ingredients in a bowl until combined.
