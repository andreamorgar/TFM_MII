Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 8x8x2-inch glass baking dish. Boil turnips, brussels sprouts, lima beans and carrots in large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain well; place in large bowl. Add 2 tablespoons butter and sage and mix to coat. Mix in ham and 3/4 cup cheese. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer vegetable mixture to prepared dish. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add breadcrumbs and sauté until golden, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix in remaining 3/4 cup cheese. Sprinkle breadcrumb mixture over vegetables. Cover with foil. Bake vegetable gratin until heated through, about 30 minutes. Uncover and bake until topping browns, about 10 minutes longer.
