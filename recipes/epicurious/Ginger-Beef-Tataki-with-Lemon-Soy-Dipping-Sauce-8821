Add beef to skillet and cook until brown, turning often, about 5 minutes. Transfer beef to roasting pan. Roast beef in oven until thermometer inserted into center registers 130°F for medium-rare, about 35 minutes. Cool. Combine soy sauce and next 6 ingredients in large resealable plastic bag.

Cover and let stand at room temperature 30 minutes. Arrange beef on plates. Spoon small mounds of daikon, ginger and green onions onto plates. Garnish with lemon wedges and shiso.
