Peel potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. In a large saucepan of boiling salted water cook potatoes until just tender, about 5 minutes. In a colander drain potatoes and rinse under cold water. Drain potatoes well. In a bowl stir together yogurt, dill, coriander, and lemon juice. Add potatoes, cucumber, and salt and pepper to taste and toss to coat.
