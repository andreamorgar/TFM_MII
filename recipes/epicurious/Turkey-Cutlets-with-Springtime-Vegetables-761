Sprinkle turkey with 1 teaspoon tarragon, salt and pepper. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add turkey and sauté until no longer pink, about 2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer turkey to plate. Reduce heat to medium. Add leeks, carrots and remaining 1/2 teaspoon tarragon to drippings in skillet. Cook until leeks begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Mix flour into vegetables and cook 1 minute. Gradually mix in broth and wine. Simmer uncovered until carrots are almost tender and sauce is thickened, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Add peas and turkey. Simmer until vegetables are tender and turkey is cooked through, about 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.
