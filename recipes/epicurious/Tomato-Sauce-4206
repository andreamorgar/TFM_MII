Blend all ingredients in a blender until very smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour through a medium-mesh sieve into a 1 1/2- to 2-quart heavy saucepan, pressing hard on and then discarding solids. Gently simmer sauce, uncovered, stirring occasionally and skimming froth, until sauce is slightly thickened and reduced to about 2 cups, 10 to 15 minutes.
