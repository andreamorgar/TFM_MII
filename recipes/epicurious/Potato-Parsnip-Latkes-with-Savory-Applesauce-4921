In small, heavy saucepan over moderate heat, bring butter to boil. Boil, uncovered, until layer of foam forms on top, then reduce heat to very low. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until thin crust begins to form on surface and milky white solids fall to bottom of pan, about 8 minutes. Strain through sieve lined with triple layer of cheesecloth into heatproof liquid measuring cup. Set aside. Using medium holes of box grater, grate potatoes and parsnips into large bowl. Stir in egg whites, chives, salt, and pepper. In large nonstick sauté pan over low heat, heat 1/2 of clarified butter until hot but not smoking. Drop 3 (1/4-cup) portions of potato mixture into pan and flatten with spatula to form 3 1/2-inch pancakes. Fry until golden-brown, turning once, about 5 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and keep warm in oven. Add more butter as necessary and cook remaining pancakes in same manner. Serve pancakes warm with crème fraîche and savory applesauce .
