1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, then add the pasta. 2. After 5 minutes, add the lima beans. 3. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until browned, about 7 minutes. 4. When the pasta is ready, drain it with the beans (reserving 1/2 cup of the liquid), then return the pasta and beans to the pot along with the onion, crème fraîche, thyme (if using), salt, pepper, goat cheese, and the reserved water. Toss together and serve.
