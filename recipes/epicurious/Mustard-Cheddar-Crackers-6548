Coarsely grate Cheddar. In a food processor fitted with steel blade blend butter and cheese until smooth. Add remaining ingredients, pulsing until just combined. In a bowl chill dough, covered, 15 minutes. Halve dough and on a lightly floured surface roll into two 12-inch logs. Chill logs, wrapped in wax paper and foil, until firm, at least 2 hours, and up to 1 week; or freeze logs up to 2 months. Preheat oven to 350°F. With a sharp thin knife cut dough into 1/8-inch slices and arrange about 1 inch apart on greased baking sheets. Bake slices in batches in middle of oven until golden, about 12 minutes. Transfer crackers to racks to cool. Crackers keep in an airtight container at room temperature 1 week.
