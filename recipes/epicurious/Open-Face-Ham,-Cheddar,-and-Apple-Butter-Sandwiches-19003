Brush cut side of ciabatta rolls with oil. Place rolls, cut side up, on baking sheet. Broil until rolls begin to brown around edges, about 2 minutes. Spread apple butter and mustard on each roll half. Top with ham, then cheese. Broil until cheese melts and begins to brown in spots, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with chives and serve.
