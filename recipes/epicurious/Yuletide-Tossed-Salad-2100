In a small bowl combine the beets well with 1 tablespoon of the red-wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon of the balsamic vinegar, the Pernod, and salt and pepper to taste and let them marinate for at least 1 hour or overnight. With a slotted spoon transfer the beets to a large serving bowl. To the liquid remaining in the small bowl add the remaining 2 tablespoons red-wine vinegar and 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, add the oil in a stream whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. To the beets add the lettuce and the chicory, add the dressing , and toss the salad.
