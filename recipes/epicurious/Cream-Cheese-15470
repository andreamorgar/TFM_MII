1. Attach a cheese or candy thermometer to the side of a medium saucepan that you can do without for a day. Add the cream and milk to the saucepan and warm over medium heat until it reaches 70°F. 2. Sprinkle in the starter and let sit for 1 minute. Add the diluted rennet. Mix thoroughly, cover, and let sit undisturbed at room temperature for 10 to 12 hours, or until the mixture resembles very firm yogurt. If the room is colder than 72°F, wrap the pot in towels and place it into a cooler to keep it warm. 3. Line a fine-meshed sieve with a large enough piece of cheesecloth that you can tie the ends together in a little sack. Set the sieve into your sink. 4. Gently pour the curds through the sieve, discarding the liquid that drains through. Tie the corners of the cloth together and hang to drain until the sack stops dripping entirely, 8 to 10 hours. You can tie the sack around your faucet (if your family won't complain too much about having a bag of cream cheese in your sink), or you can hang it in another location with a bowl below it to catch the drips (away from your pets!). Open the sack, place the cream cheese in a container, and mix with salt, herbs, or whatever your pleasure.
