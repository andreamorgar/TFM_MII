In a steamer set over boiling water steam the potatoes, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they are just tender, and let them cool, uncovered. Arrange the potato slices in one layer, overlapping them slightly, in a buttered 2-quart shallow baking dish. In a small saucepan combine the brown sugar, the water, the butter, and the salt, bring the mixture to a boil, stirring, and cook it over moderate heat for 5 minutes. Drizzle the syrup evenly over the potatoes, and bake the potatoes in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven, basting them with the syrup mixture every 15 minutes, for 1 1/2 hours, or until the syrup is thickened and the sweet potatoes have deepened in color. The candied sweet potatoes may be made 1 day in advance, kept covered and chilled, and reheated.
