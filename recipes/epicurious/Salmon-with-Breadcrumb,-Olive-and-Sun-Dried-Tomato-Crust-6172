Preheat oven to 400°F. Mix black and green olives, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, butter, rosemary and thyme in medium bowl. Mix in 1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard, then breadcrumbs. Butter large baking sheet. Place salmon fillets on prepared sheet. Spread 1 teaspoon mustard over each. Pack 1/4 of breadcrumb mixture onto each mustard-coated fillet. Bake until fillets are just opaque in center, about 12 minutes. *Available in Asian markets and in the Asian foods section of some supermarkets.
