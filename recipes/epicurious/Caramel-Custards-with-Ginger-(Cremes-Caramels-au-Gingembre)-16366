Preheat oven to 325°F. Bring water, 1/2 cup sugar, and fresh ginger to a boil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan, washing down any sugar crystals from side of pan with a brush dipped in cold water. Boil gently, without stirring, 6 minutes (syrup will be foamy). Transfer ginger with a slotted spoon to a small bowl. Cook syrup remaining in pan over moderate heat, undisturbed, until it becomes a deep caramel. Divide caramel among ramekins, tilting to thinly coat (caramel may not cover bottoms completely). Whisk together yolks, whole eggs, and a pinch of salt in a bowl. Bring milk, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, and cooked ginger just to a boil in cleaned pan. Add half of sweetened milk to eggs in a slow stream, whisking constantly but gently, then stir in remainder. (Excessive whisking incorporates air and will result in a custard with many holes.) Pour custard through a very fine sieve into a bowl and discard solids. Divide custard among ramekins and cover each tightly with foil. Put ramekins in a water bath and bake in middle of oven until set around edges with centers still wobbly, 40 to 45 minutes. Transfer ramekins with a slotted spatula to a rack and cool crèmes caramels to room temperature (centers will set as they cool). Serve in ramekins or inverted onto a plate. To invert, run a thin knife around edge of each ramekin. Invert a plate over each ramekin and, holding plate and ramekin tightly together, invert crème caramel onto plate
