Lightly coat rack of a broiler pan or a baking sheet with cooking spray. Preheat broiler. Quarter yellow peppers, discarding stems, seeds, and ribs. Put quartered peppers, skin sides down, on broiler rack or baking sheet and broil about 2 inches from heat until just tender and edges are dark brown, about 10 minutes. In a bowl let peppers steam, covered, 10 minutes. In a blender purée roasted peppers (unpeeled) with 1/2 teaspoon chili powder and pour through a sieve into a small saucepan. In a small bowl whisk together mustard, remaining 3/4 teaspoon chili powder, and 2 teaspoons olive oil. Prepare grill. Pat chicken dry and season with salt and pepper. Brush tops with mustard mixture and grill, coated sides down, on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals about 6 minutes. Turn chicken and grill 6 minutes more, or until cooked through. (Alternatively, chicken may be grilled in 2 batches in a hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderate heat, turning once, 6 minutes and then baked in a preheated 450° F. oven 5 to 10 minutes, or until cooked through.) While chicken is grilling, in a large non-stick skillet heat remaining teaspoon olive oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté pepper strips with salt and pepper to taste, stirring, until golden brown and tender, about 5 minutes. While pepper strips are sautéing, heat roasted pepper purée over low heat until hot. Arrange pepper strips on 4 plates and top with chicken. Drizzle chicken with some sauce and sprinkle with coriander. Serve chicken with rice if desired and remaining sauce on side.
