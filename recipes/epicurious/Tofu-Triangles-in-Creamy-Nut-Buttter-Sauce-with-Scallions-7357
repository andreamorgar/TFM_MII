1. Slice the tofu crosswise into scant 1/ 2-inch slabs, then cut each slab into 2 triangles. Blot with paper towels. 2. Heat a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet and add the oil. When hot, add the tofu and fry over medium-high heat until golden. Turn and cook on the second side. 3. Meanwhile, combine all the ingredients for the sauce in a small food processor and puree until smooth. Taste for salt and add a little extra, if needed. 4. When the tofu is done, pour in half the sauce and cook until bubbling and partially reduced. 5. Turn off the heat, scatter the scallions and sesame seeds over the top, and bring to the table.
