Add onion, bell pepper and celery and sauté until tender, about 10 minutes. Add onion mixture to lentils. Stir in tomato sauce and salsa. Simmer over medium-low heat until lentils are very tender, about 30 minutes. Thin soup with additional broth if necessary. Stir in spinach and simmer until heated through, about 2 minutes.
