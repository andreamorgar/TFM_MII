In a small saucepan melt butter over moderately low heat and continue to heat until golden brown with a nutlike fragrance. (Bottom of pan will be covered with brown specks.) Pour butter through a sieve lined with a dampened paper towel into a bowl and discard solids. In a small skillet heat brown butter, almonds, and lemon juice until heated through. Serve sauce over fish, chicken, rice, or vegetables such as asparagus, broccoli, or green beans.
