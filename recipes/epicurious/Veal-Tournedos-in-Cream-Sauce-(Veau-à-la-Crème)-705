Preheat oven to 450°F. Using a cheese planer or a sharp knife, cut 4 thin slices (4- by 2-inch) from Gruyère. Cook bacon in a ovenproof 10-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat, turning once, until lightly browned, about 2 minutes total, and transfer to a plate. (Do not clean skillet.) Pat veal dry and season with salt and pepper. Heat butter in skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then sauté tournedos until browned, about 4 minutes total. (Veal will be only partially cooked.) Remove skillet from heat and put a slice of bacon, then cheese and crème fraîche, on each tournedos. Roast in middle of oven, uncovered, until cheese begins to melt, 8 to 10 minutes. (Veal should be slightly pink inside.) Transfer tournedos to plates. Whisk pan juices until blended, season with salt and pepper, then divide among plates.
