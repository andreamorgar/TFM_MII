Cook two 10-ounce bags fresh spinach (not baby) in a large pot of boiling salted water just until wilted, 1-2 minutes. Drain, then transfer to a bowl of ice water; let cool. Drain and squeeze out excess water. Heat 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 2 chopped garlic cloves and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute. Add spinach, 2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar. Stir to combine; season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
