Baste with 1/2 cup broth. Continue to roast until turkey is brown and thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 180°F, basting frequently with remaining 1 1/2 cups broth and pan juices and covering loosely with foil if browning too quickly, about 1 hour 30 minutes longer if unstuffed and 2 hours longer if stuffed. Transfer turkey to platter. Tent loosely with foil; let stand 30 minutes. Reserve pan juices for gravy. Pour pan juices into large measuring cup. Spoon off fat, reserving 2 tablespoons. Heat 2 tablespoons turkey fat in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms to skillet; sauté until brown and tender, about 15 minutes.
