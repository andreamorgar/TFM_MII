In a 2 1/2-to-3 quart heavy saucepan with a tight-fitting lid over rice with cold water by 2 inches. Swirl rice around in water several times with your hand and drain. Repeat procedure 2 more times, or until water runs clear, and drain rice well in a sieve. Return rice to pan and add enough water (about 3 3/4 cups) to cover rice by about 3/4 inch. Measure by placing the tip of an index finger in the surface of the rice and ensuring that water surface is at the first joint. Bring water to a boil, uncovered, and boil rice 15 seconds. Cook rice, covered, over very low heat without lifting lid, 15 to 29 minutes, or until water is absorbed and rice is tender. Remove pan from heat and let stand, covered, 5 minutes. Turn rice gently with a flat wooden spatula and keep warm, covered. Rice is best served within 1 hour of cooking.
