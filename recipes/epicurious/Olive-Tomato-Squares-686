Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F. Spread 2 teaspoons pesto evenly on each slice of bread, then quarter each slice. Toast bread squares on a baking sheet until undersides are golden, about 10 minutes. Soak olives and tomatoes in warm water to cover 5 minutes, then drain well and toss with parsley. Mound on toasts.
