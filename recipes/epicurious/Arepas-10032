1. Combine the cornmeal and salt in a bowl. 2. Add the broth (or water). Mix until a dough with no lumps forms. 3. When it's cool enough to touch, use your hands to divide it into 8 pieces. Cover them with a damp towel. 4. Heat a lightly greased large griddle. Dip your hands in cold water (to prevent sticking) and roll each dough piece into a ball. Using your fingers, make an indentation in the center of each. 5. Push a teaspoon each of beans and cheese into each ball. Pinch the dough around the filling to enclose it. 6. Flatten each ball to 1 inch thick between your palms. 7. Cook them on the griddle until crisp, about 3 minutes a side.
