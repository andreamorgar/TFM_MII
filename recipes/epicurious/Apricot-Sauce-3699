Combine 2 cups water, sugar and dried apricots in heavy medium saucepan. Bring mixture to boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until apricots are tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from heat. Cool 15 minutes. Transfer apricot mixture to blender and puree, adding more water by tablespoonfuls if needed to form smooth sauce. Add vanilla extract and blend well. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
