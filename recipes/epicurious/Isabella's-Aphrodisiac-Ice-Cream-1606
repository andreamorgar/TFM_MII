In a small skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the almonds and saut&é until just golden. Remove the almonds and dry on paper towel. Put aside for later. In a medium saucepan, over medium heat, bring the milk to a simmer. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside. In a stainless steel bowl, or double boiler, whisk the yolks with the sugar and salt for 3 minutes, or until pale yellow. Add hot milk slowly while whisking. Place the stainless steel bowl over a pan of simmer water and cook whisking constantly, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the custard is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove the custard from the water and stir in the chilled cream, mashed figs, vanilla, and almond extract. Chill the mixture for 30 minutes, then pour into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's directions.
