Tent loosely with foil; let stand 30 minutes (internal temperature of turkey will increase by 5 to 10 degrees). Reserve pan juices for gravy. Remove turkey parts from roasting pan and discard. Pour pan juices into large measuring cup. Spoon off fat. Return pan juices to roasting pan. Add 1 3/4 cups broth, remaining 1/2 tablespoon tarragon, and 3 tablespoons butter.
