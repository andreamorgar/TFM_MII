Preheat oven to 425°F. In a small bowl whisk together mustard and mayonnaise until combined well. Pat chicken dry and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a 10-inch non-stick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and brown chicken, about 5 minutes on each side. Transfer chicken to a shallow baking dish and pour off all but about 2 teaspoons oil from skillet. Add scallion to skillet and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until softened. Stir in garlic and cook 30 seconds. Remove skillet from heat and stir in bread crumbs, horseradish, tarragon, and salt and pepper to taste. Spread mayonnaise mixture on skin side of each chicken breast and top evenly with bread crumb mixture. Bake chicken in middle of oven 10 minutes, or until cooked through, and let stand 5 minutes.
