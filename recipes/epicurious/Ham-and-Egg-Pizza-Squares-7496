Preheat oven to 450°F. Butter heavy large baking sheet; sprinkle lightly with cornmeal. Roll out dough to 12-inch square; cut into 4 squares. Transfer squares to prepared baking sheet. Bake until golden brown and crusty, about 20 minutes. Top each dough square with 1 ham slice. Divide 1 1/2 cups cheese among dough squares. Return pizzas to oven and bake until cheese melts, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, heat oil in heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Open 1 egg at a time into pan. Fry, without turning eggs over, until whites are firm but yolks are still tender. Top each pizza with fried egg. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup cheese over eggs. Transfer to plates and serve.
