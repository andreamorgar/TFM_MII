Preheat oven to 350°F. Heat oil in large ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add beef, onion, bell pepper, chili powder and garlic. Sauté until vegetables are tender and beef is no longer pink, breaking up beef with back of spoon, about 10 minutes. Add beans and tomato sauce and simmer until chili is slightly thickened and beef is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Spoon Cornmeal Mush over chili, covering completely. Place skillet in oven and bake until topping is golden brown and chili is bubbling at edges, about 40 minutes. Let pie stand 10 minutes. Spoon onto plates and serve.
