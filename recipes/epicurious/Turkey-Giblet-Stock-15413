Pat neck and giblets dry. Heat oil in a 4-quart heavy saucepan over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then brown neck and giblets, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add vegetables and sauté, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 5 minutes. Add wine and boil 1 minute. Add remaining ingredients and simmer briskly, uncovered, until liquid is reduced to about 6 cups, about 30 minutes. Pour stock through a large fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl and discard solids. Skim off and discard any fat.
