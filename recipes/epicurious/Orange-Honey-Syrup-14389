In a heavy saucepan combine the honey, the orange juice, the water, and the zest and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, or until it is reduced to 1 1/3 cups. (If the syrup is reduced too much, it becomes too thick and too sweet.) Stir in the Manto and let the syrup cool. The syrup may be made 1 week in advance and kept, covered, at room temperature. Makes about 1 1/3 cups
