In small bowl, whisk together stock and cornstarch. In second small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, sesame oil, vinegar, honey, mustard, and salt. In medium saucepan over moderately high heat, heat olive oil until hot but not smoking. Add garlic and sauté until soft, about 30 seconds. Stir in stock-cornstarch mixture and bring to boil. Reduce heat to moderate and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in soy sauce mixture and return to boil. Remove from heat and refrigerate until cool. On each of 8 plates, arrange 4 Belgian endive leaves and 4 slices persimmon around rim. In large bowl, combine frisée and baby spinach. Add vinaigrette and toss to coat. Divide among plates, placing one mound in center of each. Using vegetable peeler, shave curls of Parmesan atop each salad and serve.
