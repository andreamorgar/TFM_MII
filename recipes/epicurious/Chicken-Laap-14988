Cook rice in a dry small heavy skillet over moderately high heat, stirring constantly, until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes (rice will smoke). Grind to a coarse powder in an electric coffee/spice grinder or with a mortar and pestle. Thinly slice chicken crosswise and cut slices into thin strips. Season chicken with salt. Heat oil in a wok or heavy skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking, then stir-fry chicken until cooked through, about 2 minutes. Remove chicken from heat and stir in 2 tablespoons rice powder, reserving remainder for another use. Add remaining ingredients and stir well. Mound chicken on a platter and serve with a basket or bowl of sticky rice and plate of herbs, tomato, and cucumber.
