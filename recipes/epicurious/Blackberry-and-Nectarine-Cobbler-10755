Preheat oven to 400°F. In a bowl stir together sugar and cornstarch. Add fruit and combine well. In another bowl whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt and add butter. Blend mixture until it resembles coarse meal and stir in milk, stirring until dough is just combined. In a buttered 8-inch-square baking dish spread fruit mixture and drop dough onto it in 4 mounds. Sprinkle almonds over cobbler and bake in middle of oven 20 minutes, or until top is golden.
