Whisk together flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Blend together flour and butter with your fingertips or a pastry blender until most of mixture resembles coarse meal with small (roughly pea-size) butter lumps. Beat together yolk, vanilla, lemon juice, and water with a fork and stir into flour with fork until combined well. Gently knead with floured hands in bowl until a dough forms. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and gently knead 4 or 5 times. Form dough into a ball, then flatten into a disk and chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.
