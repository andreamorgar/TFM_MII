Toss the rice with the pesto and pine nuts and stuff the bird lightly. Close the vent and truss the bird. Rub well with olive oil. Place the turkey on its side on a rack in a roasting pan. Cover with slices of bacon and roast at 325° for 1 hour. Turn on other side and roast for another hour. Turn the bird on its back and roast with bacon covering the breast and legs until the bird is tender and done. Baste from time to time. This delicious dish is enhanced by a rich cream sauce made with turkey broth. Accompany it with grilled tomatoes, crisp French bread and a lusty red wine — a Châteauneuf-du-Pape or Gigondas. Follow with fresh fruit and a good dessert cheese.
