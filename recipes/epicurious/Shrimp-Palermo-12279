Heat oil in heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Add fennel; sauté until beginning to soften and color, about 5 minutes. Add shrimp and garlic; sauté 1 minute. Cover skillet; cook until shrimp are just pink, about 2 minutes. Add vermouth, orange juice and orange peel to skillet. Increase heat to medium-high; cook uncovered until sauce is slightly reduced and shrimp are opaque in center, about 3 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer shrimp to plates; top with sauce. Garnish with orange slices and sprinkle with fennel fronds, if desired.
