Preheat oven to 400°F. Brush bread slices generously on both sides with olive oil. Place bread on baking sheet. Bake until light golden, turning once, about 5 minutes per side. Bring broth to boil in large pot. Whisk eggs and cheese in medium bowl to blend. Gradually add egg mixture to boiling broth, stirring to form egg strands, about 1 minute. Add parsley; season with salt and pepper. Place 2 bread slices in each of 6 soup bowls. Sprinkle with diced mozzarella cheese. Ladle soup into bowls.
