Chop onion. Halve, pit, and peel avocado and cut into 1/4-inch pieces. In a bowl whisk together eggs and Cheddar and season with salt and pepper. In a nonstick skillet heat butter over moderately high heat until foam subsides and sauté onion, stirring, until just beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Add egg mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until eggs are just set, about 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat and stir in avocado. Serve eggs garnished with cilantro.
