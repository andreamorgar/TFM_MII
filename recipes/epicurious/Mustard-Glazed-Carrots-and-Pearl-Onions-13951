Cook pearl onions in small saucepan of boiling water 3 minutes. Drain. Cool slightly. Peel onions. Melt 1 tablespoon butter with oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and sauté until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add carrots, brown sugar and mustard and stir 2 minutes. Add 1 1/4 cups water and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until vegetables are tender and liquid is reduced to thin syrup, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes. Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter and stir until butter melts and vegetables are coated, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
