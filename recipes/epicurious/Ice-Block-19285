Fill a metal bowl or Bundt pan with water; freeze overnight. Let defrost just long enough to loosen the ice from its mold. For added flair, use a floral-shaped Bundt pan or add fresh ingredients to the water before freezing. Try slices of pineapple and mint leaves for the Pineapple-Gin Punch , sliced citrus for the Green Tea and Citrus Whiskey Punch , pomegranate seeds for the Pomegranate-Champagne Punch , or grapefruit slices for the Bourbon Punch with Pink Grapefruit and Mint .
