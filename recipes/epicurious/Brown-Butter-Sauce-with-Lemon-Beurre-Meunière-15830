Cut butter into pieces and in a small heavy skillet melt over moderately low heat. Simmer butter until golden brown with a nutty aroma, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and immediately add lemon juice, salt, parsley, and pepper to taste, swirling skillet to incorporate (butter will foam). Serve sauce immediately.
