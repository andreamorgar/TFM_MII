Combine plums, sugar and 1/4 cup water in heavy medium saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat until plums are tender and liquid is syrupy, about 12 minutes. Cool completely. Transfer plum mixture to processor and puree until almost smooth. Mix in orange juice, corn syrup, plum wine, orange peel, lemon juice, vanilla extract and pinch of salt. Add cream and process just until well blended. Transfer mixture to ice cream maker and process according to manufacturer’s instructions. Transfer mixture to covered container and freeze until firm, about 3 hours. (Sherbet can be prepared 2 days ahead. Keep frozen.) Scoop sherbet into bowls. Drizzle additional plum wine over sherbet and serve.
