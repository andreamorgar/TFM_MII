Whisk fresh lemon juice, minced garlic, thyme, paprika, cumin and cayenne pepper in small bowl. Place chicken in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Pour marinade over; turn chicken to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 6 hours or overnight, turning occasionally. Preheat over to 425°F. Transfer chicken and marinade to large roasting pan. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Bake until chicken is golden brown and cooked through, occasionally basting with pan juices, about 50 minutes. Transfer chicken to plates. Garnish with lemon. Pass pan juices separately.
