Use an electric mixer to beat the butter and sugar until light, about 2 minutes. Beat in the chocolate, then the egg, and continue beating until smooth, about a minute longer. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt and stir well to mix. Beat the dry ingredients into the butter and chocolate mixture. Scrape down the bowl and beater(s) and beat in the pecans. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface, flour your hands, and form the dough into a cylinder. Cut cylinder in half and roll and pull each piece into a cylinder about 8 to 9 inches long. Roll a piece of parchment or wax paper around each piece of dough and tighten the paper around it by pressing [the top of the paper] in with the side of a cookie sheet or piece of cardboard [held at a 45-degree angle against the dough as you pull the bottom end of the paper toward you]. Chill the dough until firm. Or, at this stage it can be frozen, double-wrapped in plastic, and kept for up to several weeks. When you are ready to bake the cookies, set racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Remove one cylinder of dough from the refrigerator and unwrap it. Place it on a cutting board and use a sharp, serrated knife to slice it every 1/4 inch. Arrange the slices about 2 inches apart on the prepared pans. If your oven tends to burn the bottoms of items baked on the lower shelves, place the cookies on two pans stacked together or use a special insulated pan. Bake the cookies about 10 minutes, until puffed and beginning to become firm. Continue slicing and baking cookies, or freeze remaining dough to use on another occasion. Serving: These make a great accompaniment to ice cream or a simple dessert. Storage: Keep the cookies between sheets of parchment or wax paper in a tin or plastic container that has a tight-fitting cover.
