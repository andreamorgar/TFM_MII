Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Mix butter, orange juice concentrate, chipotle chiles, molasses, and salt in microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high until melted, about 20 seconds (or melt butter in saucepan with next 4 ingredients over medium-low heat). Stir in cilantro. Grill corn until beginning to blacken in spots, turning occasionally, about 3 minutes. Brush generously with glaze. Grill until glaze sets, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer to platter and brush corn with additional glaze. Serve, passing remaining glaze and additional salt separately.
