Heat olive oil in small saucepan over low heat. Add garlic and simmer until garlic is very tender, about 10 minutes (do not brown). Remove from heat; stir in dried crushed red pepper. (Melted garlic can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm before continuing.) Cook broccoli rabe in very large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain well. Toss with melted garlic and oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
