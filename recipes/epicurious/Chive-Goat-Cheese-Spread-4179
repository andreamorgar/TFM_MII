Combine goat cheese, cream cheese, minced chives and garlic in medium bowl. Stir with fork until well blended. Place large piece of plastic wrap on work surface. Arrange whole chives in crisscross pattern atop center of plastic. Spoon cheese into center of chives, forming 4- to 5-inch round. Lift edges of plastic, wrapping chives around cheese and covering cheese completely. Refrigerate overnight. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Keep refrigerated.) Remove plastic wrap from cheese. Place cheese on platter; surround with baguette slices and serve.
