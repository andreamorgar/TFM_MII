Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375°F. Whisk brown sugar, eggs and vanilla extract in large bowl to blend. Whisk in cream, melted butter, cinnamon and salt. Stir in chopped walnuts, apricot pieces and 1 cup cranberries. Transfer filling to prepared crust. Bake until filling is set and crust is golden, tenting pie with foil if crust browns too quickly, about 1 hour. Transfer pie to rack; cool pie completely. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover pie and store at room temperature.) Garnish pie with additional dried apricots, cranberries and walnuts. Serve pie at room temperature.
