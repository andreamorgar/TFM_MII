In a bowl whisk together the egg yolks, the sugar, the cornstarch, and a pinch of salt and add the milk in a slow stream, stirring. In a heavy saucepan cook the custard over moderate heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until it comes to a boil, boil it, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes, and strain it through a fine sieve into a metal bowl set in a larger bowl of ice and cold water. Stir in the vanilla, let the custard cool, stirring, and chill it, covered, until it is cold. Stir in the cream, freeze the custard in an ice-cream freezer according to the manufacturer's instructions, and stir in the halvah. (Alternatively, the halvah may be stirred into 1 quart of softened premium vanilla ice cream.) Transfer the ice cream to a metal bowl, freeze it until it is frozen solid, and scoop it into glasses. Spoon the orange honey syrup over the ice cream.
