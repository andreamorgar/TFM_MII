Combine cream, milk, and sugar in a medium saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Remove pan from heat; cover and let stand for 30 minutes to let flavors meld. Whisk egg yolks in a medium bowl to blend. Gradually add cream mixture, whisking constantly. Return mixture to saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thickened, 5-7 minutes. Strain custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl set in a bowl of ice water. Let cool completely, stirring occasionally. Freeze custard in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. Fold in marmalade and transfer to an airtight container. Cover and freeze. DO AHEAD: Marmalade ice cream can be made 2 days ahead. Keep frozen.
