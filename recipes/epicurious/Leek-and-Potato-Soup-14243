Add the broth, nutmeg, and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cover and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Remove the bay leaf. 3. With an immersion blender, purée the soup until smooth and creamy. Add the spinach leaves and pulse to blend. 4. Season with salt and pepper and garnish with several borage blossoms. Serve hot.
