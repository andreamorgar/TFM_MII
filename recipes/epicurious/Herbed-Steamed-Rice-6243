To a kettle of boiling salted water add rice and return to a boil stirring. Boil rice 10 minutes. Drain rice in a large sieve and rinse. Set sieve over another kettle of boiling water (rice should not touch water) and steam rice, covered with a kitchen towel and lid, 20 minutes, or until tender (check water level in kettle occasionally, adding water if necessary). In a large bowl stir together remaining ingredients except coriander and add rice. Toss mixture until combined well. Cool rice to room temperature and stir in coriander.
