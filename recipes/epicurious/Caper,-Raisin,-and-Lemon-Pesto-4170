Rinse capers well and soak in cold water to cover by 3 inches 30 minutes (to remove excess salt). Drain capers well. With a vegetable peeler remove six 2 1/2- by 1/2-inch strips zest from lemon and finely chop. Halve lemon and squeeze enough juice to measure 4 teaspoons, or to taste. In a food processor combine capers, zest, juice, parsley, raisins, shallot, water, and pepper. With motor running, add oil in a stream and puree until smooth. Season pesto with salt if necessary. (Pesto keeps, covered and chilled, 1 day.)
