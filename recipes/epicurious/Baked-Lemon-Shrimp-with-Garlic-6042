Preheat oven to 450°F. In a flameproof baking dish large enough to hold shrimp in one layer melt butter with salt over moderately low heat. Stir in garlic and half of parsley. Add shrimp and bake 5 minutes. Turn shrimp and sprinkle with remaining parsley, zest, and lemon juice. Bake shrimp until just cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes more. Serve shrimp with rice and lemon wedges.
