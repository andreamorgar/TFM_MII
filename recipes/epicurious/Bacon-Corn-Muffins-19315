Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F. Whisk together milk, egg, and butter in a small bowl. Whisk together remaining ingredients in a large bowl, then add milk mixture to dry ingredients. Stir until just combined. Divide among 12 greased (1/2-cup) muffin cups. Bake until golden and a tester comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in pan on a rack 5 to 10 minutes.
