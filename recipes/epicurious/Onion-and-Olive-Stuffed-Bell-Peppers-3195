Halve 3 of the bell peppers lengthwise, leaving the stem ends intact, and core and seed them. Arrange the halves on a steamer rack set over simmering water, steam them, covered, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until they are tender, and invert them on paper towels to drain. In a small bowl whisk together 1 tablespoon of the oil and 1 teaspoon of the vinegar and brush the insides of the halves with the mixture. In a large heavy skillet cook the onions in the remaining 3 tablespoons oil over moderate heat, stirring, until they are softened, stir in the garlic and the remaining 5 bell peppers, cut into julienne strips, and cook the mixture until the peppers are just tender. Remove the skillet from the heat, stir in the olives, the remaining vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste, and divide the filling among the bell pepper halves. Serve the stuffed peppers at room temperature.
