Whisk first 6 ingredients in small bowl. Transfer to large resealable plastic bag. Add lamb; seal bag and turn to coat. Marinate in refrigerator at least 4 hours or overnight. Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Drain lamb, leaving some marinade clinging. Grill lamb until slightly charred and cooked to desired doneness, about 21/2 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer to platter. Stir honey and 1 tablespoon water in small skillet over medium heat until warm. Brush over lamb chops.
