In a small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons mayonnaise with 2 tablespoons mayonnaise and 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard. Mix the dressing with 6 roughly chopped hard-boiled eggs, 12 chopped cherry tomatoes, and 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Wash a bunch of watercress, removing the thick stems. Dry the leaves and put them in a bowl. Add a drop or two of olive oil and a squeeze of lemon juice. Season to taste with kosher salt. Take 1 slice of brioche bread and layer it with some of the watercress. Top with another slice of brioche. Add some of the egg-mayonnaise mixture on top, then sandwich with a third slice of brioche. Using a serrated knife, cut off the crusts and slice into rectangles, about 1 1/2 inches wide by 3 inches long. Repeat with another 9 slices of bread.
