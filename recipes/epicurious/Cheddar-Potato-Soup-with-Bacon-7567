Chop bacon and in a large heavy saucepan cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp. Transfer bacon with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, reserving fat in pan. While bacon is cooking, chop onion. Peel potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Cook onion in reserved fat over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened. In a measuring cup stir together flour and water and add to onion with potatoes and broth. Simmer mixture 5 minutes, or until potatoes are just tender. Add wine and simmer 1 minute. Reduce heat to low and gradually stir in Cheddar (do not let boil). Divide soup among 4 bowls and sprinkle with bacon and chives.
