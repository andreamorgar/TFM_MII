Cook cumin seeds and white part of scallions in 1 tablespoon oil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until scallions are softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring frequently, 1 minute. Stir in broth, water, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil over high heat. Cover pan, then reduce heat to low and cook until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove pan from heat and let stand, covered, 5 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork and toss with scallion greens, parsley, and remaining tablespoon oil.
