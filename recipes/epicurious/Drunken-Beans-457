Preheat oven to 300°F. In a 6-to 7-quart ovenproof kettle cook bacon, onion, oregano, and garlic over moderately high heat, stirring and scraping up brown bits, until onion is browned lightly. Add beans, water, jalapeño, and beer and bring to a boil. Bake mixture, covered, in middle of oven until beans are soft, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. (Add additional water if beans begin to dry out. Mixture should be soupy with beans very soft but not falling apart.) Stir in 2 teaspoons salt and bake beans 10 minutes more. Check seasoning, adding remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt if necessary. (Beans may be made 2 days ahead, cooled, uncovered, and chilled, covered.)
