Cook corn in large pot with boiling salted water until just tender, about 5 minutes. Drain; cool to room temperature. Cut corn kernels from cobs. Transfer corn to large bowl. Add remaining ingredients; toss to blend. Season salad to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature, tossing occasionally.)
