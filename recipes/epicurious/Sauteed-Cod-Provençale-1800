In a non-skillet heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it sauté the cod, seasoned with salt and pepper, for 30 seconds. Sprinkle the cod with the tomatoes, the olives, and the thyme, reduce the heat to moderately low, and cook the mixture, covered for 2 minutes.
