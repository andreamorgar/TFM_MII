In a glass measure stir together the broth, the soy sauce, the Scotch, the vinegar, the cornstarch, and the sugar until the cornstarch is dissolved. In a wok or large deep heavy skillet heat the oil over high heat until it is hot but not smoking, in it stir-fry the garlic and the gingerroot for 30 seconds, or until the garlic is golden, and add the spinach in batches, stir-frying until each batch is wilted slightly before adding each new one. Stir the cornstarch mixture, add it to the wok, and stir-fry the mixture mixture for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the spinach is wilted evenly and the sauce is thickened. Serve the spinach with the rice.
