Bring 3 cups water to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Add rice and salt. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered until rice is very tender and water is absorbed, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Add 1/3 cup sugar and cinnamon and stir to blend. Add milk and simmer until mixture is very thick, stirring frequently, about 25 minutes. Remove from heat. Cool 10 minutes. Stir in vanilla extract. Cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. Mix strawberries and remaining 3 tablespoons sugar in large bowl. Let stand until juices form, at least 30 minutes. (Rice pudding and strawberries can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate separately. Bring to room temperature before continuing.) Stir yogurt and 2 cups strawberry mixture into rice pudding. Transfer to large bowl. Top with remaining strawberry mixture and serve.
