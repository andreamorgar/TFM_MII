Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Brush lamb on all sides with curry paste. Let stand 15 minutes. Toast cumin seeds in small skillet over medium heat 1 minute. Place seeds in resealable plastic bag; coarsely crush with rolling pin. Mix cumin, yogurt, cucumber, and mint in small bowl. Grill or broil lamb chops until charred outside and pink inside, about 3 minutes per side. Serve with cucumber-mint sauce on the side.
