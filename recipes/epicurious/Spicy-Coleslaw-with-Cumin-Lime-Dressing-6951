Cook carrots in medium saucepan of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Drain. Cool completely. Transfer carrots to large bowl. Add cabbage, bell pepper, onion and cilantro. Whisk lime juice, cumin, garlic and hot pepper sauce in medium bowl. Gradually whisk in oil. Season with salt and pepper. (Cabbage mixture and dressing can be made 8 hours ahead. Cover separately; chill. Rewhisk dressing before continuing.) Toss salad with enough dressing to coat. Season with salt and pepper; serve.
