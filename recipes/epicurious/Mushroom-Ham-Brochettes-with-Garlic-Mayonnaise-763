Alternate 5 ham squares and 4 mushrooms on each skewer. Brush skewers with 2 tablespoons oil.(Skewers can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover and chill.) Brush heavy large skillet with remaining 1 tablespoon oil; heat over medium heat. Add skewers and cook until mushrooms are brown and softened, turning occasionally, about 12 minutes. Season skewers with salt. Serve, passing garlic mayonnaise separately.
