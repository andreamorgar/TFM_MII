Preheat oven to 325°F. Butter 10-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Blend butter and extract in medium bowl. Mix in crumbs. Press crumb mixture over bottom and up sides of prepared dish. Bake crust until just golden, about 8 minutes. Cool crust completely. Blend cream cheese in processor until smooth. Add sugar, cream, vanilla extract and almond extract and blend until very smooth, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl. Spread filling in prepared crust. Refrigerate until filling is firm, about 2 hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.) Arrange peach slices around edge of pie. Arrange blackberries in center. Brush warm jam lightly over fruit to glaze. Refrigerate pie up to 3 hours.
