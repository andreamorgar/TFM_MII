Preheat oven to 200°F. Stir together flours, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add egg, buttermilk, and 2 tablespoons oil and stir just until blended. Stir in bacon. Heat a griddle or large heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot, then lightly brush with remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil. Working in batches and using a scant 1/4 cup per pancake, pour batter onto griddle and cook, turning over once, until golden, about 4 minutes total per batch. Keep warm, covered, in oven.
