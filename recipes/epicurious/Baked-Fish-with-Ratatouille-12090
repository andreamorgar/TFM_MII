Cover and cook until vegetables begin to soften, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Mix in tomatoes and vinegar. Reduce heat to medium. Cover; cook until vegetables are very tender, about 25 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly oil 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper; arrange in prepared dish. Spoon ratatouille over fish. Bake uncovered until fish is just opaque in center, about 20 minutes.
