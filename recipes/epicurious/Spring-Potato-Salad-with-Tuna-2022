Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 35 minutes. Cool. Peel potatoes and cut into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Combine tuna and 1 1/2 teaspoons vinegar in small bowl. Whisk oil and remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar in another small bowl; add 1 hard-boiled egg yolk and mash. Season vinaigrette with salt and pepper. (Potatoes, tuna and vinaigrette can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover separately; chill. Rewhisk vinaigrette before continuing.) Thinly slice remaining 2 eggs and 1 egg white. Arrange half of potato slices in shallow dish. Season with salt and pepper. Top with half of onion, tuna, egg and parsley. Drizzle half of vinaigrette over. Repeat layering with remaining potato slices, salt and pepper, onion, tuna, egg and parsley. Drizzle remaining vinaigrette over. Serve at room temperature or chill until serving time.
