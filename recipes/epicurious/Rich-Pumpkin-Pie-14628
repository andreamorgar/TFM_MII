Line a 9" pie tin with pastry and place foil on top. Fill with dry beans and bake in a 400°F. oven for 10 minutes. Remove the beans and foil. Combine the pumpkin with the sugar, eggs, cream, seasonings and cognac and blend well. Pour through a strainer into the pie shell. Sprinkle with chopped candied ginger and bake in a 375°F. oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the pumpkin is set. Serve slightly warm with cheese or whipped cream, or both.
