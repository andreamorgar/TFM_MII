Chop chocolate and in a double boiler or a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water melt chocolate, stirring until smooth. In a bowl with an electric mixer on low speed beat together butter, cream cheese, and confectioners' sugar until light and fluffy. Transfer half of cream- cheese mixture to another bowl and stir in melted chocolate until combined well. Stir lemon juice into plain mixture in other bowl. If frostings are too soft, chill slightly before using. Frostings may be made 2 days ahead and chilled separately, covered. Bring frostings to cool room temperature and whisk before using.
