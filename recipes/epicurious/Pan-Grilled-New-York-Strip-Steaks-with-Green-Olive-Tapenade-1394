Place almonds in processor and grind finely; transfer to small bowl. Place olives, oil, capers, anchovies, and garlic in processor. Blend until fine paste forms. Add almonds; blend 5 seconds. Season tapenade with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.) Sprinkle steaks generously with salt and pepper. Coat steaks with rosemary, pressing to adhere. Heat 2 heavy medium skillets (preferably cast-iron) over high heat 5 minutes. Place 1 steak in each pan. Sear steaks 3 minutes; turn over and sear second side 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-high. Continue to cook, turning every 3 minutes, until steaks are cooked to desired doneness, about 15 minutes longer for medium-rare (thermometer inserted into center will register 130°F). Transfer steaks to platter; let stand 10 minutes. Slice steaks thinly. Serve with tapenade.
