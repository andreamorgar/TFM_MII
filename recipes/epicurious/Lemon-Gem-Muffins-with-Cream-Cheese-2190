In a bowl whisk together the flour, the baking soda, the salt, and the sugar. In another bowl whisk together the eggs, the lemon juice, the butter, and the vanilla, add the egg mixture to the flour mixture, and stir the batter until it is just combined. Divide the batter among 24 buttered 1/8-cup muffin tins and bake the muffins in the upper third of a preheated 400°F. oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Turn the muffins out onto a rack, let them cool, and serve them with the cream cheese and the papaya in cinnamon syrup.
