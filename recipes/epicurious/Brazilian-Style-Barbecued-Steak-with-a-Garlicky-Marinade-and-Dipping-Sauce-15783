Prepare the Chimichurri Rojo, and then pour 2/3 cup of it into a resealable plastic bag and combine with the skirt steaks. (Reserve the rest of the sauce to use as a condiment.) Refrigerate overnight. To cook the steaks, prepare a medium-hot grill. Remove steaks from the marinade, and grill to desired doneness. (Because they are thin and have been marinated overnight, they will cook very quickly.) Divide each steak into two, and place each in the center of a warm plate. Season with salt and pepper, sprinkle chopped olives and minced parsley over each steak. Serve with the reserved Chimichurri Rojo on the side.
