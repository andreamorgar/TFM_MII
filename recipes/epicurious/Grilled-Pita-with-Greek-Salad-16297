Purée 1 1/4 cups chickpeas, water, and 1/4 cup dressing in a food processor until almost smooth. Heat grill pan over high heat until smoking and lightly brush with oil, then grill pitas, 2 at a time, turning over once, until grill marks appear, about 2 minutes total per batch. Transfer to plates. Add salad greens, tomatoes, cucumber, olives, cheese, and remaining chickpeas to remaining dressing in bowl and toss to coat well. Spread some chickpea purée on each pita, then mound salad on top.
