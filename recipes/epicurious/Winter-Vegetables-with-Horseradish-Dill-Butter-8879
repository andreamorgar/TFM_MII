In a large vegetable steamer set over boiling water steam separately the potatoes, the Brussels sprouts, the parsnips, the carrots, and the turnips for 8 to 12 minutes, or until they are just tender. In a saucepan melt the butter over moderate heat, stir in the horseradish, the vinegar, the dill, and salt and pepper to taste, and in a large baking pan toss the vegetables with the butter mixture. Keep the vegetables warm, covered, in a 200°F. oven.
