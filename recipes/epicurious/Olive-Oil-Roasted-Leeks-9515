Place a rimmed baking sheet in oven and preheat to 400°F. Cut 6 leeks, white and pale-green parts only, in half lengthwise. Rinse well and pat completely dry. Toss with 1/2 cup olive oil; season with salt. Arrange leeks, cut side down, on hot baking sheet and cover loosely with foil. Reduce oven temperature to 300°F. Bake until leeks are lightly browned on cut sides and very tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Uncover leeks and turn cut side up. Increase oven temperature to 400°F; roast leeks until golden brown, 15-20 minutes. (Reserve the oil for making vinaigrettes or roasting vegetables. Let cool; cover and chill.)
