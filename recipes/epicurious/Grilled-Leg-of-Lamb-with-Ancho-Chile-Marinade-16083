Let lamb rest 15 minutes. Meanwhile, finely chop remaining green onion and 1 tablespoon oregano leaves; combine in small bowl. Thinly slice lamb across grain. Arrange lamb slices on platter. Pour over any accumulated juices. Sprinkle with onion-oregano mixture and serve. * Available in the spice section of many supermarkets and at Latin markets.
