1. Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line with aluminum foil a shallow roasting pan large enough to hold the ribs in one layer. 2. Combine the bourbon, garlic, honey, mustard, Tabasco, salt, and Worcestershire sauce in a small bowl. Stir well to mix. 3. Brush the rack of ribs on both sides with the glaze, then arrange, meaty-side up, in the prepared pan, making sure they don't overlap. Roast the ribs for 20 to 30 minutes to render as much of the fat as possible; pour or spoon off the fat and discard. Reduce the oven temperature to 275°F. and cook the ribs, brushing with reserved marinade every 30 minutes and turning several times, until they're tender and the glaze has caramelized and become crispy and blackened in places, 1 1/2 to 2 hours more. Let the ribs cook for 10 minutes after the last brush with the marinade. 4. To serve, cut the racks into individual ribs and pile them on a platter.
