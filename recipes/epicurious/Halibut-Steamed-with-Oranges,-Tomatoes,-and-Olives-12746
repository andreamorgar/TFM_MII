Cut off peel and white pith from oranges. Cut oranges between membranes to release segments. Heat oil in heavy very large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and garlic; sauté until tender and just beginning to brown, about 8 minutes. Add tomatoes and wine. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 3 minutes. Gently stir in orange segments and olives. Season mixture to taste with salt and pepper. Sprinkle halibut fillets with salt and pepper. Arrange halibut in single layer atop vegetable mixture in skillet. Cover and simmer gently until halibut is just opaque in center, about 12 minutes. Spoon vegetable mixture onto plates. Top with halibut. Place feta cheese atop vegetable mixture and alongside halibut. Sprinkle with chives and serve.
