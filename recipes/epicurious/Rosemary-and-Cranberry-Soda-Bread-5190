Preheat the oven to 220°C (425°F/gas mark 7). Sift the flour, bread soda and salt into a bowl. Stir the cranberries and rosemary through and make a well in the centre. Add the buttermilk and using a large spoon, mix gently and quickly until you have achieved a nice soft dough. Add a little bit more buttermilk if necessary, until the dough binds together without being sloppy. Knead the dough very lightly on a lightly floured surface and then shape into a round that is roughly 15cm (6in) in size. Place on a non-stick baking sheet and cut a deep cross in the top. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 200°C (400°F/gas mark 6) and bake for another 20–25 minutes, until the loaf is evenly golden and crusty. To check that the bread is properly cooked, tap the base – it should sound hollow. If it doesn't, return it to the oven for another 5 minutes. Transfer the cooked soda bread to a wire rack and leave to cool for about 20 minutes. This bread is best eaten while it's still warm. To serve, place the soda bread on a breadboard and cut into slices at the table. Have a dish of butter to hand for spreading.
