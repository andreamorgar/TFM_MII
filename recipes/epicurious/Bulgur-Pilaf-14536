Cook onion in oil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Meanwhile, wrap coriander seeds in a clean kitchen towel and coarsely crush by pressing with flat side of a large heavy knife. Add coriander and bulgur to onion and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Stir in hot water, then remove from heat and let stand, covered, until bulgur is softened, about 25 minutes. Fluff with a fork, then stir in almonds, salt, and pepper. Serve warm or at room temperature.
