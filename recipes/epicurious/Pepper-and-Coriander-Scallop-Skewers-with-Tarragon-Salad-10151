Coat grill with cooking spray; heat on high. Whisk juice, oil and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt in a bowl; set aside. Combine lettuce, tangerines, cucumber and tarragon in another bowl; set aside. Mix flour, coriander and peppercorns on foil. Sprinkle scallops with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt; dip in egg white. Press scallops into peppercorn mixture; slide lengthwise onto skewers. Grill scallops, turning occasionally, until no longer translucent, about 7 minutes. Remove from skewers. Toss salad greens with dressing and arrange on 4 plates; top with scallops.
