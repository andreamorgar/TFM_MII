Bring zucchini and broth to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until zucchini is very tender, about 15 minutes. Working in batches, puree soup in blender until almost smooth. Return soup to same saucepan. Add cream, nutmeg and cheese; stir over medium heat until warm. Season with salt and pepper.
