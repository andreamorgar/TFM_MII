In a large saucepan cook the onions and the bell pepper in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until the vegetables are softened, add the garlic, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, the zucchini, the parsley, the chorizos, the salt, the black pepper, and the sugar and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 40 minutes. Transfer the chorizos with tongs to a cutting board and slice them thin. Stir the vinegar into the tomato mixture, transfer the pisto to a serving bowl, and arrange the chorizos and the hard-boiled eggs on top.
