Sprinkle chicken with thyme, salt and pepper. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to plate. Add all remaining ingredients to skillet; bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits and whisking to blend well. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until sauce thickens enough to coat spoon, about 7 minutes. Return chicken to skillet and simmer until just cooked through, turning occasionally, about 6 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer chicken and sauce to plates and serve.
