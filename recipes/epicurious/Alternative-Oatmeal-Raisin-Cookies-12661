Preheat oven to 375°F. Using electric mixer, beat butter and both sugars in large bowl until smooth and creamy. Add eggs and vanilla and beat until blended. Sift flour, baking soda and salt into small bowl; stir into butter mixture. Add chocolate chips, oats, raisins, and oat bran and stir until well blended. Working in batches, drop batter by heaping tablespoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake cookies until golden but still soft to touch, about 12 minutes. Cool cookies on baking sheets.
