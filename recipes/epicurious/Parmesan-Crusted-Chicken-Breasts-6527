Combine pesto and 2 tablespoons cheese in small bowl. Place remaining cheese in shallow dish. Rub pesto mixture under skin and over chicken (about 1 generous tablespoon per breast). Season with pepper. Place chicken meat side down on cheese; press to adhere. Refrigerate uncovered for 1 hour. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover). Preheat oven to 425°F. Transfer chicken to baking sheet. Bake 15 minutes. Drizzle chicken lightly with oil and cook until crusty and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Garnish with assorted herbs if desired and serve.
