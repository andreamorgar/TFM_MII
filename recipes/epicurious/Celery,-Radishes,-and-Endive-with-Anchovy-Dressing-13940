Cut celery ribs crosswise into thirds. Beginning at 1 end of each piece of celery, make lengthwise cuts about 1/8 inch apart, cutting through to cutting board and stopping 1/4 inch from other end (so that pieces stay whole). Transfer as cut to a bowl of ice and cold water. Trim stem end of each radish to create a flat surface. Stand 1 radish stem-end down and make vertical cuts at 1/8-inch intervals into (but not all the way through) radish, stopping about 1/4 inch above stem end. Rotate radish 90 degrees and make vertical cuts in same manner to form a crosshatch pattern, keeping radish intact. Transfer to ice water. Repeat with remaining radishes. Chill celery and radishes, covered in ice water, until ends of celery curl, at least 1 hour. Trim endive and separate leaves. Keep chilled, covered, until ready to serve. Mash anchovies and garlic to a paste with salt and pepper using a mortar and pestle (or mince and mash with a large heavy knife and transfer to a bowl). Stir in vinegar with pestle (or a whisk), then add oil in a slow stream, stirring (or whisking) vigorously until dressing is emulsified. Drain celery and radishes and pat dry. Serve vegetables with individual ramekins of dressing for dipping. *Puntarelle is available by mail order from Lucio Gomiero's European Vegetable Specialties Farms, radicchio.com.
