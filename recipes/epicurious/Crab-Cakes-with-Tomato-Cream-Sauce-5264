Bring clam juice, cream, tomatoes, carrot, brandy, jalapeño chili, and 1/4 teaspoon paprika to boil in heavy large saucepan. Reduce heat to medium; simmer until sauce is reduced to 2 cups, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes. Puree sauce in blender until smooth. Return to saucepan; add pinch of cayenne pepper. Season sauce to taste with salt. (Sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Combine crabmeat, 1 1/2 cups breadcrumbs, mayonnaise, remaining 1/2 teaspoon paprika, and 1/8 teaspoon cayenne in large bowl, mixing until well blended. Form eight 1/2-inch-thick crab cakes, using scant 1/2 cup mixture for each. Coat crab cakes with remaining 1 1/4 cups breadcrumbs, pressing gently to adhere. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Arrange in single layer on baking sheet. Cover and chill.) Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add 4 crab cakes to skillet and fry until golden and heated through, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to paper-towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining crab cakes. Meanwhile, bring sauce to simmer. Divide sauce among plates; top with crab cakes. Garnish each with lemon wedges.
