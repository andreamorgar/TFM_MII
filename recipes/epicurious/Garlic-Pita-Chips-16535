Melt butter with garlic and sea salt in small saucepan over medium heat. Using small sharp serrated knife, cut each pita bread horizontally along outside edges, gently separating each pita bread with hands into 2 flat disks. Preheat broiler. Place 4 pita halves, insides up, in single layer on rimmed baking sheet. Brush pita halves with melted butter mixture. Broil just until pita halves are toasted and golden brown, watching closely to avoid burning, about 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining pita halves and butter mixture. Cool completely. Break pita halves into 2 -to 3-inch pieces. Place pita chips in serving bowl. DO AHEAD: Pita chips can be made 8 hours ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature.
