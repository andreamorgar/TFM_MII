Preheat oven to 325°F. Whisk eggs and sugar to blend in large bowl. Beat in both milks and vanilla. Add bread and let stand 5 minutes. Transfer mixture into 7x11-inch baking dish. Sprinkle top of bread pudding lightly with nutmeg. Place baking dish in large pan. Add enough water to pan to come 1 inch up side of baking dish. Bake until pudding is set in center, approximately 1 hour 15 minutes. Cool completely. Serve with Strawberry Sauce. Puree strawberries in blender or processor until smooth. Add enough lemon juice to season to taste. Add enough sugar substitute to sweeten to taste. (Can be prepared 4 days ahead; chill.) Makes about 1 3/4 cups.
