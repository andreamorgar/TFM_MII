Add 3 tablespoons oil and toss to coat, then add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, and toss. Spread bread in single layer on 1 prepared sheet. Repeat with remaining bread, 3 tablespoons oil, and 1/2 cup cheese; spread on second sheet. Bake bread until golden, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Cool on sheets. Transfer to very large bowl. Melt 1/4 cup butter with remaining 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add onions, celery, and bell peppers; sauté until vegetables begin to brown and are almost tender, about 15 minutes. Add chopped garlic, rosemary, and oregano; stir 1 minute.
