Turn chicken skin side up; continue to cook uncovered until cooked through, about 10 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to platter; tent with foil to keep warm. Pour off excess fat from skillet. Add wine and honey. Simmer until reduced to 1/3 cup, stirring often, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over chicken. Sprinkle with parsley.
