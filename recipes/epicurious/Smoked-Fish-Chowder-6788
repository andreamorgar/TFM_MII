In a heavy kettle (at least 5 quarts) cook bacon over moderate heat, stirring, until crisp. Add onions and cook, stirring, until softened. Peel potatoes and cut into 3/4-inch cubes. Add potatoes, celery, broth, and water and simmer, covered, 10 minutes. Add lima beans and corn and simmer, covered, 5 minutes. In a small bowl dissolve cornstarch in half-and-half or milk and stir into simmering soup with Worcestershire sauce. Bring soup to a boil, stirring, and add fish. (If using smoked trout, no further cooking is necessary; if using finnan haddie or fresh fish, simmer, covered, 5 minutes, or until it just flakes.) Stir in parsley or dill. Soup may be made 2 days ahead (cool uncovered before chilling covered.) Reheat gently.
