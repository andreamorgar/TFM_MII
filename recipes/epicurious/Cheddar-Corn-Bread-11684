Preheat oven to 400°F. Into a large bowl sift together cornmeal, flour, sugar, salt, baking soda, and baking powder. Put butter in a well seasoned 8-inch cast iron skillet or a 1-quart baking dish and heat in middle of oven until melted. Swirl skillet or baking dish to coat bottom and sides with butter and pour excess into another large bowl. Whisk buttermilk and egg into bowl with butter. Stir buttermilk mixture and Cheddar into cornmeal mixture until just combined. Pour batter into hot skillet or baking dish and bake 20 minutes, or until a tester inserted in center comes out clean. Cool corn bread in skillet or baking dish on a rack 10 minutes. Corn bread may be made 1 day ahead and cooled to room temperature before being chilled, wrapped in foil. Cut corn bread into 8 wedges. Reheat corn bread, covered with a paper towel to retain moisture, in a microwave oven 30 seconds on high.
