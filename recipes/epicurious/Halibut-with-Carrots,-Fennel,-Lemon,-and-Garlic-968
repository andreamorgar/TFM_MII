Preheat oven to 450°F. Line large rimmed baking sheet with foil, leaving overhang as long as baking sheet. Brush foil with 1 tablespoon oil. Scatter sliced fennel in center of foil as bed for fish. Top fennel with lemon slices, then fish, spacing slightly apart. Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper. Sprinkle carrots over fish; arrange tomatoes around fish. Drizzle 3 tablespoons oil over fish and tomatoes. Top with 16 thyme sprigs. Cover fish with foil overhang and seal. Bake fish until just opaque in center, about 12 minutes. Meanwhile, blend remaining 3/4 cup olive oil and garlic in blender until smooth. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Open foil packet. Drizzle all of sauce over fish and vegetables. Reseal foil. Let fish cool at room temperature 1 hour. Chill overnight. Discard thyme sprigs. Using large spatula, transfer 1 fish fillet with fennel base to each of 8 plates. Divide tomatoes, carrots, and sauce among plates. Garnish fish with lemon wedges and fennel fronds.
