In a large skillet, sauté onion and garlic in oil over medium-high heat until onion is translucent. Add chicken; cook 4 minutes or until no longer pink. Stir in beans, 1/2 cup salsa, and chili powder; cook 2 minutes longer. Place tortillas between moist paper towels and microwave on high 10 seconds. Spoon 1/2 cup filling onto each tortilla; top with 1 tbsp cheddar. Fold each into burrito. Serve with 1 cup spinach, salsa, remaining cheese, and sour cream.
