Preheat broiler. Sprinkle gingersnaps over yogurt in a bowl and fold once only (for a marbled effect). Put sugar in a small dish and dip cut side of each plum half in sugar to coat well. Broil plums, cut sides up, in a lightly oiled shallow (1-inch-deep) baking pan 3 inches from heat until sugar is golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve plums with yogurt.
