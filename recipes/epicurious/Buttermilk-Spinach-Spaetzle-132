Squeeze out as much liquid as possible from spinach. Place spinach in blender. Add buttermilk, oil, egg and yolk; blend well. Sift flour, salt and nutmeg into large bowl. Gradually add buttermilk mixture; stir until thick and sticky batter forms. Working in batches, drop batter by rounded 1/2 teaspoonfuls into large pot of boiling salted water, dipping teaspoon into boiling water between spoonfuls. Boil until cooked through, about 10 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer spaetzle to colander and drain well. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.) Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add spaetzle and stir until coated with butter and heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to platter; serve.
