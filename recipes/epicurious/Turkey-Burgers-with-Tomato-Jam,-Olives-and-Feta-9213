Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Brush grill rack with oil. Gently mix turkey, onion, 1/3 cup feta, 3 tablespoons chopped olives, 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil, garlic, rosemary, generous 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt, and generous 1/2 teaspoon pepper in medium bowl. Form into 4 patties, each about 1 inch thick. Brush with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill burgers until charred on both sides and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Grill cut side of rolls until toasted, about 2 minutes. Assemble burgers with Tomato Jam and additional feta and chopped olives.
