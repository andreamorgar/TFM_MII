Boil poaching liquid until syrupy, about 5 minutes. Pour syrup over fruit. Refrigerate until well chilled. Cut all peel and white pith from grapefruit. Working over bowl to catch juices, cut between membranes to remove sections. Add grapefruit to bowl. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover poached fruit and grapefruit separately and chill.) Drain grapefruit sections, reserving juice, and add to poached fruit. Thin syrup with grapefruit if desired and serve.
