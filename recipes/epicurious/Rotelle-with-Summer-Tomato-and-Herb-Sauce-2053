In a large bowl stir together the plum tomatoes, the onion, the olives, the oil, the vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste and let the sauce stand for 30 minutes. In a saucepan of salted boiling water cook the pasta until al dente, drain it, and add the hot pasta to the sauce. Add the herbs, toss the mixture until it is combined well, and serve it warm, garnished with the pear tomato halves.
