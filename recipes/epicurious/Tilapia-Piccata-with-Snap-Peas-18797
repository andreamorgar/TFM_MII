Heat grill. Fold four 18-inch-long pieces of foil in half; unfold and coat inside with cooking spray. Season tilapia with 1/2 teaspoon salt; place 1 fillet in center of 1 half of each piece of foil. Sprinkle each fillet with 2 tablespoons lemon juice and 1 teaspoon capers. Toss snap peas with potatoes and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt; divide evenly among packets. Dot each fillet with 1 tablespoon butter. Fold foil to close and crimp 2 sides of each packet, leaving 1 side open; pour 1/4 cup wine into each packet. Crimp third side of packets to seal; place on grill; close lid; cook until packets are fully puffed, 12 minutes. Carefully cut foil to open. Serve with lemon wedges.
