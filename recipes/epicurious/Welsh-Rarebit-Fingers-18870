Arrange toast so that sides touch on large baking sheet. Combine cheese, beer, butter and mustard in medium saucepan. Stir over medium-low heat until mixture is smooth. Remove from heat; stir in breadcrumbs. Spoon over bread slices to cover. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Chill.) Preheat broiler. Broil until topping begins to brown, watching to avoid burning and turning baking sheet around, if necessary, for even broiling, about 2 minutes. Cool 2 minutes. Cut each slice into 5 strips. Transfer to platter; serve.
