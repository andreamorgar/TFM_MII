Toss raspberries with 1/2 tablespoon sugar in medium bowl. Arrange figs in concentric rows over dough on baking sheet, leaving 2-inch border around edges. Sprinkle raspberries over figs. Fold dough border over fruit, pleating loosely and pinching to seal any cracks. Brush dough border with egg mixture. Sprinkle border with 1/2 tablespoon sugar.
