Boil potatoes in salted water to cover by 1 inch for 12 to 15 minutes or until just tender, then drain. When potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut into 1/3-inch-thick slices. Toss potatoes together with all remaining ingredients except arugula and season with salt and pepper. Serve potato salad over arugula.
