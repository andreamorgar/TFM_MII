Preheat oven to 400°F. Combine first 6 ingredients in 13 x 9 x 2-inch roasting pan. Drizzle oil over; toss to coat. Sprinkle with salt. Roast vegetables until tender and golden, stirring occasionally, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven. Add 2 cups water to roasting pan; stir vegetables, scraping up any browned bits from bottom. Transfer vegetable mixture to large pot. Add remaining 6 cups water and all remaining ingredients. Bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer 30 minutes. Strain. Reserve vegetables. (Can be prepared ahead. Cover broth and vegetables separately and refrigerate 2 days or freeze up to 2 weeks.)
