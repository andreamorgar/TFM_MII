In a small bowl combine well the mayonnaise and the curry powder and spread the curried mayonnaise on one side of each slice of bread. Layer half the bread slices with the cucumber, the onion, and the mint, sprinkle the mixture with salt and pepper to taste, and top the sandwiches with the remaining bread slices, pressing them firmly.
