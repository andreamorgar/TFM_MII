Heat oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic and sauté until beginning to brown, about 8 minutes. Add 2 cups broth and remaining ingredients. Bring to boil; reduce heat to medium and simmer until thickened and flavors develop, adding more broth by tablespoonfuls if too dry, about 25 minutes. Remove jerky. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Mix all ingredients in small bowl. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Preheat oven to 425°F. Using on/off turns, blend feta, breadcrumbs, olive oil, and lemon juice in processor until smooth. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Heat canola oil in heavy ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Add chicken to skillet and cook until golden, about 2 minutes per side. Remove from heat. Divide feta mixture among chicken breasts, spreading to cover top of chicken. Transfer to oven and roast until chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, rewarm ragout. Divide among 4 shallow bowls. Top each with chicken breast. Sprinkle gremolata over.
