Spread out tortillas on a work surface (in 1 layer) and let dry until leathery, about 20 minutes. Heat 1/2 inch oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot enough to make edge of a tortilla sizzle. Add 1 tortilla to oil, pushing down with a long-handled metal spatula to submerge, and fry 15 seconds. Using tongs, turn tortilla over and continue frying, pushing down into oil with spatula to keep as flat as possible and turning over occasionally, until tortilla is deep golden and bubbling begins to subside, about 1 minute more. Transfer with tongs to paper towels to drain. (Tostada will crisp as it cools.) Fry with remaining tortillas, 1 at a time, in same manner.
