Preheat oven to 425°F. Line rimmed baking sheet with foil. Place salmon, skin side down, on baking sheet; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spread crème fraîche over salmon. Roast salmon until opaque in center, about 12 to 14 minutes. To test for doneness, cut small slit in thickest part of fillet; all but center of fillet should be opaque (salmon will continue to cook after fillet is removed from oven). Using spatula, transfer to platter. *Sold at most supermarkets and at specialty foods stores.
