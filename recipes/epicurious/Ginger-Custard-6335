Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 325°F. Bring sugar, ginger, and water to a boil in a 1-quart heavy saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Add milk, then return just to a boil and remove from heat. Let stand, covered, 15 minutes. Whisk together whole eggs, yolks, and a pinch of salt in a bowl, then gently whisk in hot milk mixture. Pour through a sieve into another bowl, pressing on and then discarding solids. Divide custard among ramekins and cover each tightly with foil. Bake in a water bath until set around edges but with centers still wobbly, 35 to 40 minutes. Transfer ramekins to a rack and cool, uncovered, to room temperature, about 45 minutes, then chill, uncovered, 2 hours.
