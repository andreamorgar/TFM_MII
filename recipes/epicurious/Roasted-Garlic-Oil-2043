Preheat oven to 350°F. Place garlic cloves and 1 tablespoon olive oil in small ovenproof skillet; stir to coat. Roast in oven until garlic is just golden, shaking pan occasionally, about 15 minutes. Add extra-virgin olive oil; cool in skillet. Transfer oil and garlic to jar. Seal tightly; store in refrigerator up to 2 weeks (keep garlic in oil for flavor and looks, but use only oil in recipes).
