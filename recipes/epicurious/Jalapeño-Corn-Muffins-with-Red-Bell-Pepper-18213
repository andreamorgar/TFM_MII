Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy small saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and sauté until onion is tender, about 8 minutes. Add remaining 6 tablespoons butter; stir until melted. Combine cornmeal and next 5 ingredients in large bowl. Whisk milk and eggs together in medium bowl; mix into dry ingredients. Add onion-butter mixture, corn, red bell pepper, cilantro and jalapeño and stir until just blended. Divide batter among prepared muffin cups.
