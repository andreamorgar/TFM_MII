Make marinade: In a bowl combine marinade ingredients, stirring until brown sugar is dissolved. To marinade add olives, bell peppers, and onion. Season fish with salt and pepper and in a bowl toss with flour to coat, shaking off excess. Line a shallow baking pan with paper towels. In a large heavy skillet heat 3 tablespoons oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté fish, 6 pieces at a time, turning once and adding remaining tablespoon oil to skillet as necessary, until golden on both sides and just cooked through, about 6 minutes. Transfer fish as sautéed to paper-towel-lined pan to drain. Transfer fish to a 13- by 9-inch shallow baking dish and pour marinade mixture over fish, spreading vegetables in one layer. Marinate fish, covered and chilled, at least 1 day and up to 3. In a large saucepan of boiling salted water cook beans 3 minutes, or until crisp-tender, and drain in a colander. Refresh beans under cold water and drain. Beans may be cooked 2 days ahead and chilled in a sealable plastic bag. Remove fish from marinade mixture and add beans to dish, tossing to coat. Transfer mixture to a large deep platter and arrange fish on top.
