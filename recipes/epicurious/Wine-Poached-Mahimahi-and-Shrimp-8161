Pat fish dry with paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 3 fish fillets to skillet. Cook fish on one side only until brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer fish to plate. Repeat with remaining 1 teaspoon oil and fish fillets. Combine clam juice, wine, lemon slices, garlic and crushed red pepper in heavy large skillet. Cover and simmer until flavors blend, about 10 minutes. Add fish and any accumulated juices to skillet. Cover and simmer until fish is opaque in center, about 10 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer fish to platter. Add shrimp to fish cooking liquid. Simmer until shrimp are just cooked through, about 2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer shrimp to platter with fish. Tent with foil to keep warm. Remove garlic and lemon slices from cooking liquid; boil until liquid is reduced to 1 cup, about 20 minutes. Divide Sautéed Fennel, Capers and Arugula among 6 plates. Place 1 fish fillet atop each. Top each with 3 shrimp. Spoon reduced fish cooking liquid over. Garnish with fennel fronds.
