Cut each goat cheese log crosswise into 6 rounds. Place nuts in a shallow bowl. Press cheese rounds into nuts, turning to coat. Arrange cheese rounds on plate; reserve any remaining nuts. Cover cheese; chill. Mound greens in large salad bowl. Arrange avocado wedges atop greens. Whisk 6 tablespoons live oil and vinegar in small bowl to blend. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add cheese rounds; sauté until just warmed through but still holding shape, about 1 minute per side. Arrange cheese rounds on top of salad. Drizzle dressing over; sprinkle with reserved macadamia nuts and serve.
