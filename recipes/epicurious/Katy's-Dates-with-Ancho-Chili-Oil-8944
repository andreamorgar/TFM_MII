To make the ancho chili oil, put the olive oil and the chili powder in a small pan over low heat and warm gently for 10 minutes; set aside for 1 hour to infuse, then strain through a sheet of paper towel. This can be done the day before. Position a rack at the top of the oven and preheat to 350°F. In a small bowl, mix the walnuts, sage, garlic, orange zest, and olive oil to form a crumbly paste. Using a teaspoon press the paste into the cavities of the dates. Wrap each date with a 3-inch-long strip of the ham. (The dates can be covered and refrigerated until an hour before guests arrive, when they should be brought to room temperature.) Place the dates on an ungreased baking sheet and roast for 5 minutes (8, if they're cold); arrange on a serving tray and drip with the ancho chili oil. Serve warm or at room temperature. Napkins are a must.
