Transfer to pie dish; trim overhang to 1/2 inch. Spoon filling into crust. Roll out dough rectangle on floured surface to 11x6-inch rectangle. Cut lengthwise into 8 strips. Arrange 4 strips across pie, spacing evenly. Place remaining 4 strips across first 4 strips, forming lattice pattern. Fold dough overhang over ends of strips; crimp edge. Brush strips and edge with 1 tablespoon butter. Bake until pie is golden and filling is bubbling, covering edge with foil if browning too quickly, about 40 minutes. Cool 45 minutes. Dust pie with powdered sugar.
