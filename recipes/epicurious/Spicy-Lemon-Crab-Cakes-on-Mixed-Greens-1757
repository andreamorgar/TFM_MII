Line baking sheet with foil. Mix first 5 ingredients in large bowl. Add crabmeat and stir gently to combine. Shape mixture into eight 1/2-inch-thick cakes. Transfer to prepared sheet. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, cook crab cakes until bottoms are brown, about 4 minutes. Using spatula, carefully turn cakes over and cook until second sides are brown, about 4 minutes longer. Divide greens among 4 plates. Drizzle with vinaigrette. Top with crab cakes. Garnish with lemon wedges and serve.
