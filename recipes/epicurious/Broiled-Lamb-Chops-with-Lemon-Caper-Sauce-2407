Pat the lamb chops dry, sprinkle them with salt and pepper to taste, and broil them on the rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 6 minutes. Turn the chops, broil them for 4 minutes more for medium-rare meat, and let them stand for 5 minutes. While the chops are standing, in a small saucepan melt the butter and stir in the zest, the capers, the lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the chops to 2 plates and pour the sauce over them.
