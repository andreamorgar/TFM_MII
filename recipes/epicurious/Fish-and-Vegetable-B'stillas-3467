Add enough water to large deep skillet to reach depth of 1 1/2 inches. Add unpeeled garlic cloves and bring water to simmer. Sprinkle fish with salt; add to skillet. Poach fish gently until just opaque in center, about 10 minutes. Transfer fish to plate; cool. Flake fish coarsely; discard skin. Peel and mince cooked garlic. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add bell peppers and sauté until beginning to soften, about 4 minutes. Add preserved lemon peel, tomato paste, paprika, ginger, cumin, black pepper, turmeric, and minced garlic. Sauté 5 minutes to blend flavors. Remove from heat; mix in cilantro, parsley, harissa, and remaining 3 tablespoons oil. Cool mixture. Gently stir in flaked fish. Cook rice noodles in large saucepan of boiling salted water until just tender, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Drain; rinse under cold water to chill quickly. Cut noodles into 1-inch pieces. Stir noodles into fish mixture and season filling to taste with salt. Line 2 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Place 8-inch plate on work surface. Place 1 phyllo sheet over plate, centering plate underneath. Fold another phyllo sheet in half, brush with butter, then fold in half again and place in center of phyllo over plate. Mound 1 cup fish filling on folded phyllo; shape filling into 5-inch-diameter round. Fold 1 corner of phyllo sheet over filling. Continue to lift and fold edges of phyllo sheet over filling at 6-inch intervals, brushing each fold with melted butter and covering filling completely. Turn b'stilla onto parchment-lined baking sheet, seam side down. Brush all over with more butter. Repeat with remaining phyllo and filling, making 6 b'stillas total. DO AHEAD: Can be made 6 hours ahead. Refrigerate. Preheat oven to 400°F. Bake b'stillas until heated and pastry is golden brown, reversing sheets after 12 minutes, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer to platter.
