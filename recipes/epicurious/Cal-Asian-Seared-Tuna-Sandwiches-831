Flavored mayonnaise is easy to make, and it lends added appeal to any sandwich. Here, sesame oil, soy sauce, ginger and green onions give the spread an Asian flair. Mix first 5 ingredients in small bowl to blend. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Sprinkle tuna with salt and pepper. Heat vegetable oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add tuna and cook to desired doneness, about 2 minutes per side for medium-rare. Spread mayonnaise mixture over 1 side of each bread slice. Top 4 bread slices with cucumber, radishes, then avocado, dividing equally. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Top with tuna steaks. Place remaining bread slices, mayonnaise side down, atop tuna. Cut sandwiches in half and serve immediately.
