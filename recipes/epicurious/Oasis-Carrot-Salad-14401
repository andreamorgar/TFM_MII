Cook carrots in a medium saucepan of boiling water until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain, then rinse under cold water until cool. Drain well. Meanwhile, pulse onion and garlic with oil, vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a food processor until very finely chopped. Toss with carrots and chill at least 3 hours. Just before serving, toss salad with cilantro, parsley, and salt to taste.
