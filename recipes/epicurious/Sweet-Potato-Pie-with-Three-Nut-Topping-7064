For Crust: Coarsely grind all nuts in processor. Blend in graham cracker crumbs, sugar and pumpkin pie spice. Add butter and blend in using on/off turns until moist crumbs form. Press crumbs onto bottom and sides of 9-inch deep-dish glass pie dish. Set aside. For Filling: Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake sweet potatoes until tender, about 1 hour. Cool potatoes; peel. Puree in processor. Transfer to bowl and whisk in eggs. Cook butter in heavy medium skillet over medium heat until melted and brown. Add sugar, honey and pumpkin pie spice and boil 1 minute, stirring constantly. Whisk in cream. Add butter mixture to potato puree; blend until smooth. Pour filling into crust. Bake until center moves only slightly when pan is shaken, covering with foil if crust browns too quickly, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, Prepare Topping: Stir first 3 ingredients in heavy medium saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil 1 minute. Mix in nuts, coating completely. Spoon hot nut mixture over pie. Continue baking until topping bubbles, about 5 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool completely.
