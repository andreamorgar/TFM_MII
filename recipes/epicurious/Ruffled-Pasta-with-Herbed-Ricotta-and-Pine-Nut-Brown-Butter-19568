Stir together ricotta, Parmigiano-Reggiano, herbs, pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large serving bowl. Cook pasta in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water, then drain pasta in a colander. While pasta is boiling, heat butter and oil in a deep 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until foam subsides. Add pine nuts and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until nut and butter mixture is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Add drained pasta to pine nut butter along with 1/3 cup of reserved pasta cooking water and stir to coat. Thin ricotta mixture with 1/2 cup more of reserved cooking water, then add pasta and toss to combine. Thin with some of remaining reserved cooking water if necessary. Serve immediately.
