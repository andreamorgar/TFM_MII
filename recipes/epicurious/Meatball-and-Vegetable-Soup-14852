Combine pork, beef, parsley, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper in large bowl; blend well. Form mixture into 1-inch balls. Heat oil in heavy large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Working in batches, add meatballs to pot and brown on all sides, about 4 minutes. Transfer to bowl after each batch. Pour off all but 3 tablespoons drippings from pot. Add potatoes, carrots, leeks and rutabaga; sauté 5 minutes. Add broth and tomatoes with their juices. Return meatballs and any collected juices to pot. Bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium; simmer uncovered until meatballs and vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes. Season with more Worcestershire sauce, if desired and salt and pepper.
