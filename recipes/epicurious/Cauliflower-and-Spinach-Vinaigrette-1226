In a small bowl whisk together the vinegar, the olives, the roasted peppers, the parsley, and salt to taste, add the oil, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. In a shallow microwave-safe dish arrange the cauliflower in one layer, add 2 tablespoons water, and microwave the cauliflower, covered with a microwave-safe lid, at high power (100%) for 8 minutes, or until it is tender. Transfer the cauliflower with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Put the spinach in the microwave-safe dish and microwave it with the water clinging to its leaves, covered with the lid, at high power (100%) for 2 minutes. Blot the spinach dry with a triple layer of paper towels, pressing out the excess liquid. Transfer the spinach to a platter, mound the cauliflower on it, and spoon the dressing over the vegetables. Serve the vegetables at room temperature.
