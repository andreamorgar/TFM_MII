Prepare grill. On a steamer rack set over simmering water steam beef ribs, covered, 20 minutes. While ribs are steaming, in a small saucepan cook garlic in oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until golden. Stir in ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and curry powder and simmer, stirring, until thickened slightly, about 1 minute. Transfer ribs to a large plate and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Grill ribs on a rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals, meat sides down, until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Grill ribs on edges until golden, about 2 minutes on each edge, and grill, bone sides down, until golden, about 3 minutes. Brush ribs with barbecue sauce and grill, continuing to baste, until barely charred, about 1 minute on each side.
