Preheat oven to 400°F. In a shallow bowl, combine breadcrumbs, paprika, garlic salt, and red pepper. Pour buttermilk into a separate shallow bowl. Dip chicken in buttermilk, then dredge in breadcrumb mixture. Place chicken, meaty side up, in a large baking pan. Generously coat chicken pieces with cooking spray. Bake for 40 minutes or until done. Check internal cooking temperature of chicken with a meat thermometer until breasts reach 170°F and thighs reach 180°F.
