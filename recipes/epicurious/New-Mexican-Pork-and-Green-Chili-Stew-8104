In a large heavy kettle cook the onions and 6 of the garlic cloves, minced, in the oil over moderate heat, stirring, until the onions are softened, add the pork, the chilies, the water, and the salt, and simmer the mixture, uncovered, adding more water if necessary to keep the pork barely covered, for 1 1/2 hours. Stir in the potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces, making sure they are covered by the cooking liquid, and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes, or until the pork and the potatoes are tender. Stir in the remaining 2 garlic cloves, minced, and salt to taste and simmer the stew for 5 minutes. The stew may be frozen or made 3 days in advance, cooled, uncovered, and kept covered and chilled.
