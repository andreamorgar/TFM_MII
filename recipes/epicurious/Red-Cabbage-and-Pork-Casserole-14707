1. Blanch the cabbage in boiling water. Set aside. 2. Insert 2 whole cloves into each of the ribs. Place the olive oil in a heavy pot over medium heat; brown the ribs, about 6 minutes per side. Remove ribs to a plate. Reduce heat to low; add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes. Return ribs to the pot. 3. Add reserved cabbage, tomato, apple, celery, bay leaves, vinegar, sugar, salt and pepper. Cook, partially covered, over medium heat for 15 minutes. Uncover and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours more, making sure the meat does not stick to the bottom of the pot and the cabbage covers the meat. Serve immediately with potatoes, if desired.
