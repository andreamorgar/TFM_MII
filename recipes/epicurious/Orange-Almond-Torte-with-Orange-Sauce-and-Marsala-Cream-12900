Gradually add sugar, beating until blended. Add egg, then yolks, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. At low speed, beat in almonds, flour, orange juice, peel, coriander and salt, scraping down sides of bowl occasionally. Using clean dry beaters, beat whites in medium bowl until stiff but not dry. Fold whites into batter in 2 additions. Transfer to prepared pan. Bake cake until top is golden and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool cake in pan on rack.(Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature.) Beat whipping cream and 2 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl until soft peaks form. Mix in Marsala.
