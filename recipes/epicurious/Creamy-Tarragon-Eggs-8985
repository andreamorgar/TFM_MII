Whisk together eggs, tarragon, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper, then stir in cream cheese, separating bits if necessary. Melt butter in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until foam subsides. Pour egg mixture into skillet and cook, stirring gently, until eggs are creamy and softly set, about 5 minutes. Season with salt.
