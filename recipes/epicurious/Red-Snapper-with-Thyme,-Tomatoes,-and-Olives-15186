Combine plum tomatoes, shallot, and chopped thyme in small bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cut 1 sheet of aluminum foil about 18 inches long. Place on work surface. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil in center of aluminum foil. Place red snapper fillets side by side in center of aluminum foil. Top with tomato mixture. Sprinkle with olives. Drizzle fish with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Fold foil over, enclosing contents completely and crimping edges tightly to seal. (Can be prepared up to 6 hours ahead; refrigerate.) Preheat oven to 450°F. Place large baking sheet in oven and heat 10 minutes. Place foil packet on heated baking sheet. Bake until fish is opaque in center, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven; let stand 5 minutes. Open foil packet over bowl to catch juices. Serve fish with juices over white rice.
