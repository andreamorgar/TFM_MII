Purée all ingredients for marinating shrimp, except shrimp, with 1/2 tsp salt in a blender until smooth. Pour into a sealable bag, then add shrimp and marinate at cool room temperature, turning bag occasionally, 30 minutes. Make chutney while shrimp marinate: Toast cumin in a dry small skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir together remaining chutney ingredients with 1/4 tsp salt, then sprinkle with toasted cumin. Prepare grill for direct-heat cooking over hot charcoal (medium-high heat for gas); Thread 4 shrimp onto each skewer, leaving small spaces between them. Put on a tray. Oil grill rack, then grill skewers, covered only if using a gas grill, turning once, until just cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes total. Serve with chutney.
