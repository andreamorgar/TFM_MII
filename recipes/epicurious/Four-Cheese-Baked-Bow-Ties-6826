Preheat oven to 375°F. and butter a 3-to 4-quart gratin dish or other shallow baking dish. In a heavy saucepan melt butter over moderately low heat. Add flour and cook roux, whisking, 3 minutes. Add milk and reserved tomato juice in a stream, whisking, and bring to a boil, whisking. Stir in tomatoes and salt and pepper to taste and simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes. In a kettle of salted boiling water cook pasta until just al dente, about 8 minutes, and drain well. In a bowl stir together pasta, sauce, mozzarella, Gorgonzola, Fontina, 1 cup Romano, and parsley and transfer to prepared dish. Sprinkle pasta with remaining 1/3 cup Romano. Bake bow ties in middle of oven 30 to 35 minutes, or until golden and bubbling, and let stand 10 minutes before servings.
