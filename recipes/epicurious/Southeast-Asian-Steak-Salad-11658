Tear romaine into pieces into a bowl. Halve cucumber lengthwise and seed. Thinly slice cucumber crosswise and add to romaine. Chill romaine mixture, covered. Mince shallot, jalapeño, and garlic (wear rubber gloves when handling jalapeño) and in a large bowl stir together with lime juice, soy sauce, 1 tablespoon oil, fish sauce, and sugar until sugar is dissolved. Pat steak dry and season with salt. In an 8- to 10-inch heavy skillet heat remaining tablespoon oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté steak 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare. Transfer steak to a cutting board and let stand 5 minutes. While steak is standing, stack mint leaves and thinly slice. Toss mint with romaine mixture and all but about 2 tablespoons dressing until combined well. Divide salad between 2 plates and slice steak. Toss steak with remaining dressing and arrange on salads.
