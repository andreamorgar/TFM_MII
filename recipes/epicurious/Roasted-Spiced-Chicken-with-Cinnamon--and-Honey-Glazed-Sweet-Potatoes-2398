Place onion, garlic, apple cider vinegar, honey, ground allspice, chopped fresh ginger, chopped fresh thyme, salt, ground black pepper, seeded and minced chile, cinnamon, and nutmeg in processor. Purée marinade until coarse paste forms. Place chicken in large resealable plastic bag. Add marinade to chicken in bag and seal. Turn chicken to coat. Refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight, turning chicken occasionally. Preheat oven to 400°F. Arrange chicken pieces, with marinade still clinging to chicken, on rimmed baking sheet. Brush chicken with oil. Roast until cooked through, about 45 minutes. Spray another rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray. Whisk butter, honey, lime juice, and ground cinnamon in large bowl. Add potato slices; toss to coat. Arrange potato slices in single layer on prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake potatoes alongside chicken until tender, about 25 minutes. Serve chicken with potatoes, passing mango chutney separately.
