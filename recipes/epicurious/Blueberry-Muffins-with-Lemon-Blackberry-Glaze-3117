To make the muffins, mix together the almond meal, flax meal, and salt in a mixing bowl. Add the agave syrup, vanilla, and coconut oil and mix well. Add the water and mix to a batter consistency. Fold in the blueberries. Place 6 cupcake liners into a muffin pan and spoon about 1/2 cup dough into each. Place the pan in the dehydrator and dehydrate at 104°F for 4 to 6 hours, until the batter is dry and to desired consistency. To make the glaze, combine the cashews, blackberry juice, lemon juice, agave syrup, and water in the Personal Blender with the 1-cup container and blend until smooth. To serve, frost each muffin with the glaze. Will keep for several days refrigerated. Can be frozen for several weeks and thawed. Warm muffins in the dehydrator at 104°F for an hour or two before serving.
