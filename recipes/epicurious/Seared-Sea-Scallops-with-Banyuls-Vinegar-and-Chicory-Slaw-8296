Whisk 2/3 cup oil, 3 tablespoons vinegar, and shallot in small bowl to blend. Season vinaigrette to taste with salt and pepper. Very thinly slice radicchio and endive; tear escarole and frisée into 2-inch lengths. Place in large bowl. (Vinaigrette and slaw can be made 6 hours ahead. Chill dressing; let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before using. Place damp kitchen towel over slaw and chill.) Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle scallops with salt and pepper. Working in batches, add scallops to skillet and cook until golden and just opaque in center, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Rewhisk vinaigrette; pour over slaw and toss to coat. Divide slaw among 8 plates. Arrange 3 scallops atop slaw on each plate. Add remaining 3 tablespoons vinegar to same skillet along with 3 tablespoons water. Bring to boil over medium heat, scraping up any browned bits and dissolving any caramelized juices. Drizzle juices over scallops. *Banyuls vinegar is a rich, oak-aged vingear (made from the naturally sweet wine of the same name) from the south of France.
