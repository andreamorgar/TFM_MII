Bring broth to simmer in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add endive and simmer uncovered until tender, about 12 minutes. Drain thoroughly. Place on paper towels and cool. Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 11x7-inch glass baking dish. Roll each endive in ham slice to enclose. Arrange rolls in prepared dish. Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour; cook 1 minute. Add milk, cream, mustard, and nutmeg and bring to boil, whisking constantly. Boil sauce 1 minute; season with salt and pepper. Spoon sauce over rolls. Sprinkle Swiss cheese evenly over. Bake until sauce is bubbling all over and cheese begins to brown, about 30 minutes. Serve immediately.
