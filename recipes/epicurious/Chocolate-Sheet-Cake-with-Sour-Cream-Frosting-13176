Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter and flour 13x9x2-inch metal baking pan. Whisk first 5 ingredients in medium bowl to blend. Beat butter in large bowl until fluffy. Gradually add sugar, beating until well blended. Beat in eggs 1 at a time. Beat in flour mixture in 4 additions alternately with 3/4 cup sour cream in 3 additions. Fold in 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips and almonds; spread in prepared pan. Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Transfer to rack; cool cake. Meanwhile, combine remaining 3/4 cup sour cream and 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over very low heat just until chocolate melts and frosting is smooth (do not boil). Spread frosting over cake in pan. Let stand until frosting sets, at least 1 hour.
