1. Soak 24 10-inch wooden skewers in water to cover for 6 to 8 hours. (This helps prevent their burning on the grill.) 2. Combine all the marinade ingredients in a large bowl. 3. Rinse the shrimp under cold water. Drain and pat dry. Toss shrimp in the marinade and let rest for 30 minutes. 4. Prepare hot coals for grilling or preheat the broiler. 5. Thread 16 skewers with 3 shrimp each and 8 skewers with 2 shrimp each. Grill or broil 4 inches from the heat source for 3 minutes per side, brushing once on each side with extra marinade. 6. To serve, place a lemon half in the bottom of 8 wine glasses, cut-side down. Into each lemon half, stick 2 skewers with 3 shrimp and 1 skewer with 2 shrimp, balancing them. Insert a rosemary sprig into each lemon half (using an extra skewer to jab a hole, if necessary). Serve the glasses atop small plates with a bowl of my Lemon Garlic Mayonnaise for dipping.
