Preheat oven to 325°. Partially cook the bacon in an ovenproof skillet over low heat for 5 minutes. Do not let the bacon get hard. Transfer to a large bowl, add all the other ingredients, and mix very well. Put the mixture back into the skillet or into a standard 8-inch loaf pan and bake for 1 hour, or until the meat loaf reaches an internal temperature of 150°. Serve with an assortment of roasted vegetables.
