For the sauce, combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl and refrigerate at least 2 hours. 3. Remove chicken pieces from marinade and season well with salt and pepper. Grill chicken for 5 minutes on each side, until golden brown and juices of chicken run clear when pricked with the end of the skewer. Thread 3 pieces of chicken onto each skewer.
