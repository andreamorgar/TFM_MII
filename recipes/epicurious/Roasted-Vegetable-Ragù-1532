Preheat oven to 400°F. Spray rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray. Spread mushrooms and next 6 ingredients in single layer on prepared sheet. Drizzle with oil; sprinkle with 2 teaspoons rosemary, salt, and pepper. Roast until vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. Add zucchini, 2 cups broth, and tomatoes with juices to vegetables; stir to blend well. Continue to roast until zucchini are tender and juices thicken slightly, stirring occasionally and adding more broth if liquid evaporates too quickly, about 30 minutes longer. Transfer ragù to bowl. Mix basil, parsley, and 1 teaspoon rosemary into ragù. Season with salt and pepper.
