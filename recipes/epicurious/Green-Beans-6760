In a large saucepan of boiling salted water cook beans until-crisp-tender, about 6 minutes, and drain well. Serve green beans with mustard sauce. In a bowl whisk together mustard, sugar, and vinegar until sugar is dissolved and whisk in oil until sauce is emulsified. Whisk in water to thin sauce to the desired consistency. Sauce may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled. Serve sauce at room temperature. Makes 1 1/2 cups.
