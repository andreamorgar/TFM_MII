Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper. Coat with flour. Heat 3/4 cup oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Sauté fish in batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Discard oil; wipe out skillet. Heat remaining 3/4 cup oil in same skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and crushed red pepper. Sauté until onions are tender, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and dried rosemary; sauté 1 minute. Carefully add wine and tomato juice; simmer 2 minutes. Add chopped tomatoes and vinegar; simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 8 minutes. Add fish; simmer until opaque in center, turning fish once, about 2 minutes. Arrange fish in single layer in 13x9x2-inch baking dish. Season sauce with salt and pepper; pour over fish. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 day and up to 2 days, turning fish once. Arrange fish and sauce on platter. Bring to room temperature. Garnish with rosemary and tomato halves, if desired.
