In a saucepan of boiling salted water cook the potatoes, peeled, for 10 minutes, drain them, and let them cool until they can be handled. Grate the potatoes coarse into a bowl. While the potatoes are cooking, in a large skillet sauté the ham in 1 tablespoon of the oil over the moderately high heat, stirring, until it is browned lightly and transfer it with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. To the skillet add the onion, the bell pepper, the pimiento, and salt and pepper to taste, cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring, until the vegetables are softened, and add it to the potatoes with the ham. Season the mixture with salt and pepper and combine it well. To the skillet add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and heat it over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking. Form the potato mixture into 2 cakes, fry the cakes in the oil for 4 minutes on each side, and make an indentation in each cake. Break 1 of the eggs into each indentation, season the eggs with salt and pepper, and cook them covered, for 6 minutes, or until they are cooked through and the potato cakes are crisp and golden.
