Soak the corn husks in warm water until soft, about 2 hours. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the lard, baking powder, and salt and beat until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and fold in the masa harina and chicken stock. Using a rubber spatula, beat the dough until you can form a little ball that will float in cold water. Arrange a softened corn husk on a work surface and spread with a thin layer of masa dough. Add a spoonful of Salsa Verde and some chicken. Fold the husks in thirds, as if folding a letter, then tuck the ends under. Continue filling and folding the remaining the tamales. Fill a large steamer or tamalera with salted water to just below the steamer rack and bring to a boil. Arrange the tamales in a crisscross pattern on the rack, leaving enough space between them to allow steam to circulate. Steam the tamales for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Let rest for 30 minutes before serving.
