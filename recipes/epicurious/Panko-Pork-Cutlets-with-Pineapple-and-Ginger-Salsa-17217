Stir pineapple cubes, sugar, minced ginger, and 3/4 cup water in medium saucepan over medium-high heat until mixture comes to boil. Reduce heat to medium; cover and simmer until pineapple is soft, stirring often and adding more water by 1/4 cupfuls if dry, about 30 minutes. Stir in white wine vinegar. Season pineapple salsa to taste with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, pound pork between sheets of waxed paper to 1/2-inch thickness; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Whisk eggs in medium bowl to blend. Mix panko and ground cumin in another medium bowl. Place flour on plate. Dredge pork in flour; dip into beaten eggs, then turn in panko mixture to coat, pressing to adhere. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add pork and cook until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Serve pork with pineapple salsa.
