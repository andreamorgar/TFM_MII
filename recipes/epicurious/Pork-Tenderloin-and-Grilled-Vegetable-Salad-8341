Trim off tail ends of tenderloins to form 2 (8-ounce) pieces, reserving trimmings for another use. Boil wine, rosemary sprig, garlic, and red pepper flakes in a small heavy saucepan until reduced to about 1/2 cup, 7 to 8 minutes. Pour through a fine sieve into a measuring cup, then transfer rosemary sprig, garlic, and red pepper flakes to a sealable plastic bag along with 1/4 cup wine marinade and tenderloins. Marinate, chilled, turning bag occasionally, at least 2 hours or overnight. Return remaining 1/4cup wine marinade to saucepan and add vinegar, honey, and chopped rosemary, then boil dressing until reduced to about 1/4 cup, 6 to 8 minutes. Prepare grill for cooking. When fire is medium-hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 3 to 4 seconds), put bell peppers, zucchini, and onion on a lightly oiled grill rack and place over fire. Grill zucchini and onion, turning, until tender, 8 to 10 minutes, then transfer to a cutting board. Grill peppers until skins are blackened and flesh begins to soften, about 8 minutes, then transfer to a bowl, cover, and let steam 10 minutes. While peppers are steaming, pat pork dry and season with salt and pepper. Grill on lightly oiled grill rack over medium-hot fire, turning frequently, until an instant-read thermometer inserted diagonally 2 inches into meat registers 155°F, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board, then tent loosely with foil and let stand 10 minutes before slicing. Peel peppers and cut into 1-inch pieces. Transfer to a large bowl. Cut zucchini and onion into 1-inch pieces and add to peppers. Toss vegetables with 2 tablespoons rosemary dressing, 1 teaspoon oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Toss arugula with remaining teaspoon oil. Mound grilled vegetables on 4 plates and top with sliced pork. Add any juices from cutting board to remaining 2 tablespoons dressing and drizzle over pork. Top with arugula.
