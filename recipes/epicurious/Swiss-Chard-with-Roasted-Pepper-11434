Using a long-handled fork char the peppers over an open flame, turning them, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the skins are blackened. (Or broil the peppers on the rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 2 inches from the heat, turning them every 5 minutes, for 15 to 25 minutes, or until the skins are blistered and charred.) Transfer the peppers to a bowl and let them steam, covered, until they are cool enough to handle. Peel them starting at the blossom end, cut off the tops, and discard the seeds and ribs. In a kettle cook the chard stems in about 1/2 cup water, covered, over high heat for 5 minutes, add the chard leaves, and cook the chard, covered, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Drain the chard well and in a bowl toss it with the roasted pepper, the oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Reserve 1 1/2 cups of the chard mixture, covered and chilled,, for making the cod cannelloni.
