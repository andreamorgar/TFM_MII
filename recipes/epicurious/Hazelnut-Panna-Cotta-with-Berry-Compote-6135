Place 1/2 cup cream in small saucepan; sprinkle gelatin over.Let stand until gelatin softens, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, stir 1 1/2 cups cream, crème fraîche, hazelnuts, and 1/2 cup sugar in medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves and mixture comes to gentle boil. Remove from heat. Cover; steep 5 minutes. Strain into 4-cup measuring cup, pressing on hazelnuts to release all cream (about 3 cups). Stir gelatin mixture over medium-low heat until gelatin dissolves. Whisk gelatin mixture into strained cream. Whisk in Frangelico and vanilla. Divide mixture among six 3/4-cup custard cups. Refrigerate panna cottas until cold and set, at least 6 hours and up to 1 day. Mix berries and 2 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl; toss to blend. Spoon sugared berries over each panna cotta.
