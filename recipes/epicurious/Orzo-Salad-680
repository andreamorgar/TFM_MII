Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle. Roast pine nuts in a rimmed sheet pan until golden, about 8 minutes. Cook orzo in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water until tender, then drain well in a colander. Meanwhile, whisk together lemon juice, oil, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl. Add hot orzo to dressing and toss. Let orzo come to room temperature, stirring occasionally. Add pine nuts, peppers, mozzarella, arugula, and radicchio and toss well. Season salad with salt, pepper, and additional lemon juice, if desired.
