Add sliced fennel bulb and red bell pepper and sauté until just tender, about 3 minutes. Add broccoli. Drizzle remaining 2 tablespoons oil over vegetables. Stir in herbes de Provence. Pour broth over. Simmer until broccoli is crisp-tender and liquid evaporates, about 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. *A dried herb mixture available at specialty foods stores and in the spice section of some supermarkets.
