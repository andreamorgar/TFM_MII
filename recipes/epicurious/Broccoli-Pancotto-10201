Preheat oven to 450°F. Place bread cubes on baking sheet. Bake until bread is lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Set aside. Heat oil in heavy large deep skillet over medium heat. Add chilies and garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add broccoli florets, 1 cup water, salt, and toasted bread cubes. Toss to coat. Cook uncovered until bread absorbs water and broccoli is crisp-tender, tossing often, about 20 minutes. Drizzle pan drippings from beef tenderloin over, if desired; toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl and serve. *Available at Latin American markets and some specialty foods stores.
