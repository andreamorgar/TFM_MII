Roll cheese into 1-inch-thick log about 10 inches long. Sprinkle with 3/4 teaspoon pepper. Cut log crosswise into 6 equal pieces. Wrap each piece with prosciutto. Whisk vinegar, shallot, mustard, and honey in medium bowl; gradually whisk in oil. Season with salt and pepper. Add arugula; toss to coat. Divide plums and prosciutto-wrapped goat cheese pieces among plates. Place dressed arugula alongside; garnish with mint.
