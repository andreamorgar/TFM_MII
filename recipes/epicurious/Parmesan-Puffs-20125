Beat whites in a bowl with an electric mixer until they just hold stiff peaks. Fold in cheese. Form level teaspoons of batter into balls (about 20). Heat oil in a 4-quart heavy pot until thermometer registers 375°F. Fry balls in 2 batches, turning them, until golden and crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer parmesan puffs with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.
