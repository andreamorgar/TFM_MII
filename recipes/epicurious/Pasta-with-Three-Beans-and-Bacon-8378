Sauté chopped bacon in heavy large pot over medium-high heat until fat is rendered, about 5 minutes. Add onions, mushrooms, garlic and oregano and sauté until onions are soft, about 8 minutes. Add wine and bring to boil. Add beans and tomatoes with juices. Reduce heat to medium. Simmer until liquid thickens and flavors blend, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes. Mix in pasta and 3/4 cup cheese and simmer 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer pasta to large bowl. Serve, passing remaining cheese.
