In a large bowl whisk together the juices and garlic paste, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. Whisk in the chopped coriander and salt and pepper to taste. Add the tomatoes, the cucumbers, the radishes, and the scallions, toss the salad to combine it well, and garnish it with the coriander sprigs.
