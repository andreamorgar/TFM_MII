Cut 6 (8- by- 6-inch) rectangles of cheesecloth without unfolding it. Rinse with cold water and wring dry. Line molds with damp cheesecloth, allowing it to hang over sides, and put molds in a shallow baking pan. Purée cottage cheese with 1/3 cup sugar and zest in a food processor or blender until very smooth, then add Neufchâtel cheese and purée until smooth. Add yogurt and pulse just until blended, then divide mixture among molds. Cover tops of molds with a sheet of plastic wrap and chill until firm, at least 8 hours. Purée berries with liqueur and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in a food processor, then force through a fine-mesh sieve set into a bowl, discarding seeds. Invert molds onto dessert plates and remove cheesecloth. Serve coeurs à la crème drizzled with sauce.
