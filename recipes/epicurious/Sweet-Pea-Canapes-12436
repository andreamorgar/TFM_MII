Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375°F. Simmer peas with water in a 1 1/2- to 2-quart saucepan, covered, until tender, about 5 minutes. Purée peas with water in a food processor (do not use a blender) until very smooth. Force purée through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, discarding solids, then chill until cold. Beat cream with salt and pepper in another bowl until it holds stiff peaks, then fold in pea purée and cheese until just combined. Chill pea mousse, covered, while making toasts. Cut 24 very thin slices from baguette, then halve slices. Toast slices in 1 layer on a baking sheet in oven until edges are golden, 7 to 9 minutes. Cool toasts completely on a rack. Spoon a dollop of mousse onto each toast, then top with a small piece of ham (torn from a slice). Serve immediately.
