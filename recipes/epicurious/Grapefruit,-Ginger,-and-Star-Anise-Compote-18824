Bring 1 cup water, sugar, ginger, and star anise to boil in medium saucepan over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until mixture begins to thicken, about 10 minutes. Stir in grapefruit peel. Reduce heat to low and simmer syrup 30 minutes. Place all grapefruit sections in large bowl. Using slotted spoon, remove ginger from syrup and discard. Pour hot syrup with star anise over grapefruit; let stand at room temperature 1 hour, stirring occasionally. (Can be made 4 hours ahead; cover and chill.) Divide fruit and syrup among 6 small bowls; discard star anise. Serve compote chilled or at room temperature. *Brown star-shaped seedpods, sold at Asian markets, specialty foods stores, and in the spice section of some supermarkets.
