Heat butter in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat until foam subsides, then cook meat, onion, salt, pepper, and spices, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until meat is no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Add lime juice and water and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, 30 minutes. Add split peas and simmer, covered, until peas are falling apart and meat is tender, 40 to 45 minutes. Keep warm, partially covered. Peel potato and cut into 1/4-inch dice. Heat 1/2 inch oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then fry potato in 2 batches, stirring occasionally, until crisp and golden brown, about 7 minutes. Transfer potato with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and season with salt. Fold fried potato into stew just before serving, or serve it on top.
