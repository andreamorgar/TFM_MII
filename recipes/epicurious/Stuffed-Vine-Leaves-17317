Vine leaves in jars are available at many specialty shops. As they are packed in brine, be certain to wash them well before using. Remove the stem. If you use fresh vine leaves, soak them in olive oil to cover for 24 hours. Blanch for 2 minutes in boiling water. Combine the cooked rice, raw meat, nuts, raisins and salt and pepper. Bind with the egg. Form into tiny balls and place one on each vine leaf. Fold and roll so that the stuffing is firmly enveloped. (If you place the ball in the center, and fold in the side points and then roll, the envelope will stay intact.) Place the stuffed leaves in a skillet with olive oil, a little lemon juice and water to half cover. Cook gently for 15-20 minutes, turning carefully two or three times during the cooking. Remove to a rack covered with absorbent paper, or cool in the pan. Serve cold with a little of the cooking liquid and a dusting of thyme, or serve with yoghurt and a sprinkling of thyme and parsley.
