Coat a medium saucepan with cooking spray. Cook bell pepper, onion and garlic in pan over medium heat, stirring, 3 minutes. Add chicken, barbecue sauce, chipotles and 1/4 cup water; cover and simmer until chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°:F, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove chicken from sauce; place on a plate to cool for 5 minutes. Use a fork to pull meat off bone and shred; return meat to pan and toss to coat with sauce. Heat oven to 400°F. Open buns and set on a baking sheet covered with foil. Distribute chicken evenly among bottom half of each bun (about 2 tablespoons per bun); top each with 2 tablespoons cheese. Bake until cheese melts and bubbles, 4 to 5 minutes. Top with tomatoes, sprouts and bun cap; serve immediately.
