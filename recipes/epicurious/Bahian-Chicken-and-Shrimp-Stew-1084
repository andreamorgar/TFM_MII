Whisk together 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons lime juice, half of garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl. Add chicken and toss to coat, then marinate, chilled, 30 minutes. Whisk together 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 tablespoon lime juice, remaining garlic, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper in another bowl. Add peeled shrimp and toss to coat, then marinate, covered and chilled, until ready to use (not more than 1 hour). Meanwhile, grind dried shrimp in grinder until very fluffy, about 1 minute. Pulse peanuts and cashews separately, in small batches, in a food processor, until finely ground (do not grind to a paste). Remove chicken from marinade and pat dry. Heat remaining tablespoon olive oil in a 5- to 6-quart wide heavy pot over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then, starting skin sides down, brown chicken, in batches if necessary, turning over once, about 6 minutes total per batch, transferring to a large plate. Add onions and bell pepper to pot and sauté, stirring occasionally and scraping up brown bits (from chicken), until onions are golden, 6 to 8 minutes. Add tomatoes and malagueta peppers or Thai chiles and cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes begin to break down, about 3 minutes. Stir in stock and bring to a simmer. Add chicken, along with juices accumulated on plate, and simmer, covered, until chicken is cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Stir in ground shrimp and ground nuts and return to a simmer. Toss marinated shrimp with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and add to stew along with marinade. Simmer until shrimp are just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in coconut milk, cilantro, remaining tablespoon lime juice, and dendê oil (if using). *Available at Asian markets. **Available at some Latino markets. ***Available at some Lantino markets and sendexnet.com.
