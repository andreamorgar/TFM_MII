Cut bread into 3/4-inch pieces. Divide among six 1 1/4-cup soufflé dishes or custard cups. Whisk pumpkin, yolks, egg, liqueur, vanilla, nutmeg and salt in medium bowl until blended. Add half and half mixture; whisk until smooth. Pour pumpkin custard over bread in dishes, dividing equally. Let stand 30 minutes, occasionally pressing on bread to submerge. Preheat oven to 350°F.
