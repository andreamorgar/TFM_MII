Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Using melon baller or small spoon, core each pear half, leaving 1 1/2-inch-diameter cavity. Arrange 8 pear halves, cut side up, in prepared baking dish. Puree remaining 2 halves in processor. Place 1/2 cup puree in medium bowl (reserve any remaining puree for another use). Mix cookie crumbs and yolk into puree in bowl. Mound filling in pear cavities. Combine 6 tablespoons sugar, lemon juice and butter in small saucepan. Bring to boil over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves and butter melts. Spoon syrup over pears. Bake pears until tender, basting occasionally with syrup in dish, about 1 hour. (Can be prepared 3 hours ahead; let stand at room temperature.) Whip cream with liqueur and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar in medium bowl until soft peaks form. Serve pears with whipped cream.
