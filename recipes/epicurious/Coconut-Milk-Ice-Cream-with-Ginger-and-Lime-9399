Finely grate ginger, then chop very finely. Set aside enough chopped ginger (including juices) to measure 1/3 cup. Whisk coconut milk, sugar, half and half, lime juice, lime peel, salt, and reserved 1/3 cup grated ginger in medium bowl until sugar dissolves. Transfer mixture to ice cream maker.

Scoop ice cream into 6 stemmed glasses or bowls. Garnish with mango and lime. Available at Indian, Southeast Asian, and Latin American markets and many supermarkets.
