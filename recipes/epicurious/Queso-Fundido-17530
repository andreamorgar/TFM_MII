Cook chorizo in 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring, until golden and pieces start to crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels. Cook onion, garlic, peppers, and paprika in fat remaining in skillet, stirring occasionally, until vegetables start to soften and turn golden, about 8 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup water and simmer, uncovered, until vegetables are tender and almost all liquid is evaporated, about 3 minutes. Stir in refried beans and remaining 1/2 cup water and simmer until slightly thickened and mixture is bubbling, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in reserved chorizo and half the cheese until melted. Preheat broiler with rack about 6 inches from heat. Pour bean mixture into a shallow (2-quart) flameproof crock or baking dish and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Broil 5 to 7 inches from heat until golden and bubbling, about 3 minutes. Serve with tortilla chips.
