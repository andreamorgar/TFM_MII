Melt 1 tablespoon unsalted butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons unsalted, shelled raw natural pistachios and cook, stirring often, until nuts are deeply toasted, about 2 minutes. Let cool. Chop pistachios. Place in a small bowl; toss with 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives, 1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon, and 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme. Season 8 large sea scallops (side muscle removed) with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon unsalted butter and 1 teaspoon grapeseed oil in a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add scallops; sear until crusty brown, about 2 minutes per side. Roll scallops in pistachio mixture.
