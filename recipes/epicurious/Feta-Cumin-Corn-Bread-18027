Preheat the oven to 350°F. Into a large bowl sift together the cornmeal, the flour, the baking powder, the baking soda, the salt, and the cumin, add the Feta and the scallion, and toss the mixture well. In a bowl whisk together the eggs, the milk, the sugar, and the oil, add the milk mixture to the cormeal mixture, and stir the batter until it is just combined. Pour the batter into a greased loaf pan, 9 by 5 by 3 inches, and bake the corn bread in the middle of the oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Let the corn bread cool in the pan on a rack for 5 minutes and run a thin knife around the edges of the pan. Turn the corn bread out onto the rack and let it cool completely. The corn bread may be made 2 days in advance and kept wrapped tightly in foil and chilled.
