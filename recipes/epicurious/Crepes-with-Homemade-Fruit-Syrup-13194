1. Put the blackberries, sugar, and 1 ounce of water in a pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until the mixture has reached a syrupy consistency, about 10 minutes. 2. Meanwhile, sift the flour and salt into a medium mixing bowl. 3. Whisk the beaten eggs and milk together and pour them into the flour mixture. 4. Whisk in the melted butter, then strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve to remove any lumps. 5. Place a nonstick pan over medium heat. Melt the pat of butter, then pour in enough batter to cover the surface of the pan. Cook until golden brown, about 1 minute on each side. 6. Fold the crepe in half, pour syrup over, and serve.
