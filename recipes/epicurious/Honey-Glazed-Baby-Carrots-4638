In a steamer set over boiling water steam the carrots for 4 to 8 minutes, or until they are just tender, and transfer them to a bowl. In a skillet melt the butter with the honey and the lemon juice, stirring until the mixture is smooth, and add the carrots. Cook the mixture over moderately low heat, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the carrots are glazed evenly and heated through, and season it with salt and pepper.
