Preheat oven to 450°F. Generously butter two 1 1/4-cup soufflé dishes or custard cups. Divide asparagus pieces between prepared dishes. Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan. Drizzle 3/4 teaspoon butter over asparagus in each dish. Reserve remaining butter in pan. Bake asparagus until just tender and beginning to brown, about 6 minutes. Maintain oven temperature. Meanwhile, add flour and mustard to remaining butter in pan and whisk until smooth paste forms. Set over medium heat and whisk 1 minute. Whisk milk and yolks to blend in small bowl; whisk into flour mixture. Cook until sauce thickens, whisking constantly, about 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat. Add grated cheese, salt and pepper and stir until cheese melts. Beat egg whites in medium bowl until stiff but not dry. Fold whites into warm cheese mixture in pan. Spoon all of soufflé batter over asparagus in dishes. Bake soufflés until puffed and golden, about 14 minutes. Serve immediately.
