1. Melt the butter in a medium-large, non reactive stockpot over low heat. Add the onion and garlic and sweat, stirring occasionally, until translucent but not browned, about 8 to 10 minutes. 2. Add the flour and cook, stirring, until the mixture develops a nutty aroma, about 10 minutes. Be careful not to let the flour brown. 3. Add the tomatoes, breaking them up against the side of the pot with a wooden spoon if they're canned. Add the stock, tomato paste, and mint and increase the heat to high. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a steady simmer. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes are very soft, about 30 minutes. 4. Pour the soup into a colander set over a second pot. Pass the tomatoes through a food mill and return them to the stock in a pot. Stir to blend the soup. 5. Whisk in the cream, then simmer, uncovered, whisking frequently, until the soup is well flavored and slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. Season with salt, pepper and a pinch of sugar to highlight the sweetness of the tomatoes, if desired. Serve piping hot.
