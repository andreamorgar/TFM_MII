In a large bowl, combine the meat, all but 2 tablespoons of the parsley, the scallions, bulgur, egg, 2 tablespoons of the oil, the minced garlic, cumin, salt and pepper to taste. Knead well, cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. Shape 2-tablespoon-sized portions of the meat mixture into balls. Place on a plate, cover and refrigerate. In a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons oil and saute the onion over high heat for 4 to 5 minutes, or until it starts to color. Add the chopped garlic and saute for 30 seconds. Add the wine and simmer for 1 minute. Stir in the tomatoes and cinnamon stick. Carefully add the meatballs to the skillet; the sauce should almost cover them. Add the water, bring to a boil and reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through and the sauce has thickened. Remove the cinnamon stick, sprinkle with the remaining 2tablespoons parsley and serve.
