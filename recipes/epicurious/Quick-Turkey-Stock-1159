In large stock pot over high heat, combine stock, neck, heart, and gizzard. Bring to boil, then lower heat to moderately low and simmer, uncovered, 20 minutes. Strain through fine-mesh sieve, pressing on solids to extract all liquid. Discard solids. (Stock can be made up to 3 days ahead and refrigerated until ready to use.)
