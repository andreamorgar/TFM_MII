Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion; sauté until golden, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and stir 1 minute. Stir in chili sauce, chutney, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and mustard; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until mixture is reduced to 2 3/4 cups, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes. Stir in hot pepper sauce. Transfer sauce to bowl; cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover; chill. Bring to room temperature before serving.)
