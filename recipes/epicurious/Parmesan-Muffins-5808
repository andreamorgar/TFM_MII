Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Whisk together eggs, milk, and oil in a bowl. Whisk together 3/4 cup cheese and all of remaining ingredients in a large bowl, then add wet ingredients to dry ingredients. Whisk until combined. Divide among 12 greased (1/2-cup) muffin cups. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese and bake until a tester comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in pan on a rack 5 to 10 minutes.
