Cook 2 1/4 cups (3/4 pound) blueberries with 1/2 cup maple syrup in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until blueberries have burst, 3 to 8 minutes. Cool in an ice bath, stirring occasionally. While blueberry mixture cools, beat cream with remaining 1/4 cup maple syrup in a bowl using an electric mixer until it just holds stiff peaks. Stir lemon juice and remaining 1 1/4 cups blueberries into cooled blueberry-maple mixture. Spoon about 2 tablespoons blueberry mixture into each of 6 glasses and top with half of crumbled cookies and half of whipped cream. Repeat layering of remaining blueberry mixture, crumbled cookies, and whipped cream. Serve parfaits immediately.
