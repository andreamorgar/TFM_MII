Cut apart the pumpkin and remove the seeds. Peel the sections and cut into 1 inch cubes. In a large mixing bowl, toss the sugar, water, and pumpkin pieces. Transfer the pieces, plus all the water and sugar, to a baking pan. Cover tightly with foil and bake in a preheated 350° oven for 1 hour. Check the water level after 30 or 40 minutes. Add more if necessary, or bake uncovered if it is too wet. There should be little water left and the pieces should be soft but not mushy. Allow to cool, then refrigerate. Serve sprinkled with hazelnuts, and with the whipped cream.
