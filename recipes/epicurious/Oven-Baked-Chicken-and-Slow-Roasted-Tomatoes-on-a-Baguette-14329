Preheat oven to 200°F. Place the tomatoes, cut side up, on a baking sheet lined with nonstick foil. Season with the salt and pepper, drizzle with 3 tablespoons of the oil, and bake 6 to 8 hours. Remove and let cool. (Or use a handful of sun-dried tomatoes.) Meanwhile, place the chicken and yogurt in a resealable plastic bag and refrigerate for at least 3 hours. Preheat oven to 425°F. In a shallow pan, combine the bread crumbs, zest, rosemary, Parmesan, the remaining oil, and more salt and pepper. Remove the cutlets, shaking off any excess yogurt, and press them firmly into the bread-crumb mixture. Transfer to a pan lined with nonstick foil and bake until browned and firm, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove and let cool, then assemble as shown.
