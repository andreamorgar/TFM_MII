Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 325°F. Sprinkle ribs evenly with salt. Bring orange juice, soy sauce, sugar, ginger, garlic, and pepper to a boil in roasting pan over moderately high heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Add ribs in 1 layer using tongs, turning to coat, and cover pan tightly with foil. Braise ribs in oven until very tender, about 2 hours. (If making ahead, see cooks' note, below.) Reduce oven temperature to 200°F. Transfer ribs to a baking dish, arranging them in 1 layer, and keep warm in oven. Skim fat from cooking liquid if desired, then make glaze by boiling liquid, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until syrupy and reduced to about 3/4 cup, about 15 minutes. Brush glaze generously on ribs.
