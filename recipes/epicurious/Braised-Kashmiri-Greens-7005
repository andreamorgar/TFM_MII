Discard the tough stems from the greens. Chop the tender stems and set aside, then roughly chop the leaves. Heat the oil in a large, wide pot over moderately high heat until it shimmers, and add the asafetida and cumin seeds. Cook, stirring, until the spices are fragrant, about 1 1/2 minutes. Add the shallots, ginger, and chile, and cook, stirring, until the shallots are translucent, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the stems of the greens and salt to taste, then cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the greens and cook, tossing occasionally with tongs, until just tender, about 20 minutes. Discard the chile and season with salt and pepper to taste.
