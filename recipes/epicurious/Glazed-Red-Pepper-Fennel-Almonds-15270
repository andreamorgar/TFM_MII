Preheat oven to 325°F. Line heavy baking sheet with foil; spray with nonstick spray. Combine sugar, fennel seeds, crushed red pepper, and salt in medium bowl. Mix in almonds and 1 tablespoon water. Spread mixture on prepared baking sheet in single layer. Bake until sugar melts and almonds are deep golden brown and glazed, stirring often, about 22 minutes. Separate almonds with fork; cool completely on sheet. (Can be prepared 1 week ahead. Store in plastic bag.) Transfer almonds to bowl and serve.
