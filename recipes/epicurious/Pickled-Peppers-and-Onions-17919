Halve bell peppers and discard seeds, ribs, and blossom ends. Cut peppers lengthwise into 1/2-inch-wide irregular pieces and transfer to a large heatproof bowl. Trim and peel onions. Halve garlic cloves. Add onions and garlic to peppers. In a saucepan bring water and vinegars to a boil and add juniper berries, sugar, and salt. Simmer mixture, stirring occasionally, 3 minutes, or until sugar is dissolved. Pour vinegar mixture over peppers and onions, covering them completely, and cool. Chill peppers and onions in an airtight container at least 12 hours and up to 5 days.
