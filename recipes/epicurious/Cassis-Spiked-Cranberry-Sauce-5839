Bring 1 cup water, 1/2 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup crème de cassis to boil in heavy medium saucepan over high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Add fresh cranberries; return to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until cranberries pop and sauce thickens, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in dried cranberries, ketchup, and 2 tablespoons crème de cassis. Chill until cold, at least 4 hours and up to 3 days.
