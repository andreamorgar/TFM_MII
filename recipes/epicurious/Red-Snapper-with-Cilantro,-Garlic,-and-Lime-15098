Preheat broiler and lightly oil a shallow baking pan (1 inch deep). Pat fish dry, then arrange, skin sides up, in 1 layer in baking pan. Brush both sides of fish with 3 tablespoons oil total and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss together cilantro, garlic, and zest in a small bowl. Broil fish 6 inches from heat, without turning over, until just cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer fish, skin sides up, with a metal spatula to a platter, then sprinkle with cilantro mixture and drizzle with remaining 3 tablespoons oil.
