Place flour in a shallow dish. Add 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper; stir with a fork to combine. Season butterflied trout lightly with more salt and pepper. Pat both sides of the trout in flour, shaking gently to remove excess flour. Heat butter or oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add trout to skillet, skin-side up. Cook until pale golden, about 3 minutes. Turn and continue cooking, 3 to 4 minutes more. Remove trout to a warmed serving platter. Remove skillet from heat. Add butter, lemon juice, and capers. Brown the butter, stirring with a wooden spoon to release the brown bits in the bottom of the skillet, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour sauce over trout and serve immediately.
