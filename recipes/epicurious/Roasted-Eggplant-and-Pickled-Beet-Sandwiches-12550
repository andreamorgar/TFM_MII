Preheat oven to 400°F. Place eggplant slices on a large rimmed baking sheet and rub both sides with oil. Season with paprika, salt, and pepper. Roast until golden and tender, 30-40 minutes. Whisk garlic, mayonnaise, and vinegar in a small bowl; set aside. Toss scallions, herbs, beets, olives, capers, and oil in a medium bowl to combine. Spread cut sides of focaccia with garlic mayo. Build sandwiches with focaccia, eggplant, feta, and beet salad. DO AHEAD: Eggplant can be roasted 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.
