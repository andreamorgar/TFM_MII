Cook beans in large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Drain. Refresh under cold water; drain well. Transfer to large bowl. Combine mustard and vinegar in small bowl. Gradually whisk oil. Mix in shallots. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover beans and dressing separately. Refrigerate beans; let dressing stand at room temperature.) Mix dressing and tomatoes into beans. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
