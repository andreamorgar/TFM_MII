Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Cut baguette crosswise in half. Cut each half lengthwise in half to form 4 pieces total. Combine oil, garlic, and herbs in small bowl. Brush all cut sides of bread with half of oil mixture. Grill bread, cut sides down, until lightly toasted, about 1 minute. Remove from grill. Quickly spread cut sides of toast with goat cheese. Top with tomatoes and olives, dividing equally. Drizzle remaining oil mixture on top. Return open-face sandwiches to grill. Cook until bottom sides are toasted, cheese melts, and tomatoes begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Cut each sandwich diagonally in half and serve.
