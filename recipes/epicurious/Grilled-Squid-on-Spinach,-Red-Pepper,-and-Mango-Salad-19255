Cut squid bodies open to make flat pieces and score inner side of flattened squid in a crosshatch pattern with a sharp knife, blade held horizontally at a 30-degree angle (do not cut all the way through flesh). Cut squid bodies into 4- by 1-inch pieces. Pat squid bodies and tentacles dry and toss with spices and 1/2 teaspoon oil. Cut sides from bell pepper and brush with 1/2 teaspoon oil. Heat a lightly oiled well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then grill bell pepper, turning once, until just tender, about 4 minutes. Cut bell pepper into strips. Grill squid bodies, crosshatch sides down, and tentacles, turning once, until just cooked through (squid will curl up as it cooks), about 2 minutes. Toss together bell pepper, spinach, mango, onion, lime juice, remaining 2 tablespoons oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Top salad with squid and serve with lime wedges.
