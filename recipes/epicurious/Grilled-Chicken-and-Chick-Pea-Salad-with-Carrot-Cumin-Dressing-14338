Prepare grill In a saucepan boil carrot juice until reduced to about 3/4 cup, about 10 minutes, and cool. In a bowl, whisk together carrot juice, lemon juice, oil, and cumin and season dressing with salt and pepper. Dressing may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Cut romaine and spinach crosswise into 1/4-inch-wide strips and, using side of a grater with largest holes, grate carrots. Cut tomatoes into 1/4-inch dice. Rinse chick-peas and slip off skins. Vegetables may be prepared up to this point 4 hours ahead and chilled separately, covered. Pat chicken dry and season with salt and pepper. Grill chicken on a lightly oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 7 minutes on each side, or until cooked through. (Alternatively, grill chicken in a hot lightly oiled well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat.) Let chicken stand 2 minutes and slice. In a large bowl toss chicken with vegetables. Just before serving, toss salad with dressing.
