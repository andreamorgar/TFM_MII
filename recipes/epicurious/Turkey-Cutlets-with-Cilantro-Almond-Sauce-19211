Whisk together vinegar, garlic, red-pepper flakes, and 1/4 teaspoon salt until salt is dissolved. Add 3 tablespoons oil in a slow stream, whisking until combined well, then whisk in almonds and cilantro. Prepare grill for cooking with hot charcoal (high heat for gas). Whisk together coriander, cinnamon, remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a shallow bowl. Turn cutlets to coat in spice mixture. Grill turkey, turning once, until just cooked through, about 3 minutes total. Transfer to a platter. Spoon almond sauce over turkey.
