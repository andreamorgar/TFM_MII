Melt 1 tablespoon butter with 1 tablespoon oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add both bell peppers, jalapeño and minced garlic; sauté until peppers are almost tender, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, clam juice, 1/3 cup cilantro, wine, water, lemon juice and dried red pepper. Bring to boil. Reduce heat; simmer until flavors blend, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Mix flour and garlic powder in shallow bowl. Season tuna with salt and pepper. Coat with flour mixture, shaking off excess. Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter with 1 tablespoon oil in another heavy large skillet over high heat. Add tuna to skillet and sauté until just opaque on the outside, about 2 minutes per side. Bring sauce to simmer over medium heat. Add tuna; cook until opaque in center, about 2 minutes. Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain pasta. Divide among 4 plates. Place tuna atop pasta. Spoon sauce over. Sprinkle with Parmesan and cilantro and serve.
