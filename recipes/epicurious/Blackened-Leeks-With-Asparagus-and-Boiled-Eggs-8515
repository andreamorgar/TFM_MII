Gently lower eggs into a medium pot of boiling water; cook 6 minutes. Transfer eggs to a bowl of ice water and let cool. Heat a dry large cast-iron skillet over medium-high until smoking hot. Cook leeks, cut side down, pressing to ensure contact with skillet, until blackened, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; add butter and rotate skillet to evenly coat leeks. Transfer leeks to a platter with a slotted spoon. Add asparagus to skillet, season with kosher salt and pepper, and cook, tossing occasionally, until bright green and crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat, add lemon juice and mustard, and toss asparagus to coat. Transfer to platter with leeks and spoon sauce over. Peel eggs, halve, and place on top of vegetables. Top with sea salt.
