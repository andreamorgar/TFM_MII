1. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until wilted, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, 2 to 3 minutes more. Sprinkle with curry powder and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly to mellow the flavor, 1 to 2 minutes. 2. Add the zucchini, yellow squash, potatoes, carrots, broth, honey, and cinnamon stick. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook, partially covered, until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. 3. Stir in the tomatoes and corn; cook 5 minutes longer. Serve atop couscous in shallow bowls. Garnish each with a tablespoon of Raita Refresher and the chopped mint.
