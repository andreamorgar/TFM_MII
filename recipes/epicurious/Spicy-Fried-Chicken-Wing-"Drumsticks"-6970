Cut off the wing tips, reserving them for another use such as stock if desired, and halve the wings at the joint. Separate the "drumstick," or first-joint, pieces (the thick ones) from the second-joint pieces. Beginning at the narrower end of each "drumstick," with a sharp knife cut the tendons and, holding the exposed end of the bone with a kitchen towel, scrape the skin and meat down the bone as far as possible toward the thicker end to make a plump drumstick shape. Cut through the cartilage at one end of each second-joint piece, separating the bones, scrape the skin and meat down the large bone to make a plump drumstick shape, and pull out and discard the smaller bone. Arrange all of the "drumsticks" in a shallow dish, sprinkle them with the lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste, and let them marinate, covered and chilled, for 1 hour. In a bowl whisk together the flour, the salt, the paprika, the cumin, the pepper, the thyme, and the cayenne and make a well in the center. Add the beer and the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the batter until it is smooth. Let the batter stand at room temperature for 1 hour. Stir the batter before using it. In a large deep fryer or large deep kettle heat 2 inches of the oil to 375°F. on a deep-fat thermometer. Dip the chicken in the batter and fry it in the oil, 5 pieces at a time, turning it, for 3 minutes, or until it is cooked through and golden. Transfer the chicken with a slotted spoon as it is fried to paper towels to drain and make sure the oil returns to 375°F. before adding each new batch. Sprinkle the "drumsticks" with salt to taste, arrange them on a platter, and garnish the platter with the parsley sprigs.
