Stir together all ingredients and season with salt and pepper. Preheat oven to 200°F. Heat 2 inches oil to 375°F in a wide 5-quart heavy pot over medium heat. While oil heats, mince and mash garlic to a paste with a pinch of salt, then whisk together with eggs, buttermilk, and scallions in a bowl. Whisk together cornmeal, flour, baking powder, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl, then stir in buttermilk mixture until just combined. Stir in crabmeat. Working in batches of 10, carefully drop tablespoons of batter into oil and fry, turning occasionally, until golden-brown, about 3 minutes per batch. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet and keep warm in oven. Return oil to 375°F between batches. Serve hush puppies with tartar sauce. Schloss Saarstein 1st Growth Riesling Kabinett '08
