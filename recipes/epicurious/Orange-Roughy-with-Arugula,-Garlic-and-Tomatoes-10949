Cut garlic slices into thin slivers. Fold each parchment in half. Cut into half heart shape. Open up. Place arugula on 1 side of parchment (same size area as size of fish). Sprinkle arugula with half of garlic. Season fish with salt and pepper. Arrange atop arugula and garlic. Top fish with tomato and remaining garlic. Sprinkle vinegar over. Season with salt and pepper. Fold parchment over to enclose fish. Crimp parchment edges to seal. Transfer fish to baking sheets. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Refrigerate.) Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake until fish is slightly firm, approximately 15 minutes. Serve immediately.
