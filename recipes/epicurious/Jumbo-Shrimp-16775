Rinse shrimp in cold water, drain, and pat dry. Combine the fish sauce, olive oil, sugar, and grated lemon zest in a bowl. Add the shrimp; coat well. Let rest, covered, in the refrigerator for 2 hours, tossing twice. Cover a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Arrange half the shrimp on the sheet, leaving a little space between each. Broil 3 inches from the heat source until just cooked, 3 minutes per side. Repeat with the rest of the shrimp. Then cool to room temperature. Pack up in a portable container and enjoy!
