Preheat broiler. Halve eggplants lengthwise. Brush cut sides with 1/4 cup oil and season with salt. Arrange as many eggplants, cut sides up, as will fit in 1 layer on rack of a broiler pan and broil 2 to 3 inches from heat until browned, about 5 minutes. Turn oven setting to 450°F. and move pan to middle of oven. Roast until tender when pierced with a fork, about 12 minutes. Repeat with remaining eggplants. Blend remaining 1 1/2 cups oil and remaining ingredients in a blender until emulsified. Serve eggplants at room temperature, drizzled with vinaigrette. 6 small (4-oz.) eggplants 8 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds, toasted 1/4 cup fresh cilantro 1/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 garlic clove 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon cayenne 3 tablespoons lemon juice
