Place lentils, bay leaves, and garlic in a large saucepan. Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Turn heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes, until lentils are tender. Drain, discarding bay leaves. Transfer to a bowl. Add peppers, carrot, tomato, feta, olives, onion, and parsley. Toss to combine. In a separate bowl, whisk together vinegar, oil, salt, and black pepper. Pour over lentil mixture and toss.
