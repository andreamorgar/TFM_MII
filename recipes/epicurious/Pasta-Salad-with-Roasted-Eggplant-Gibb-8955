Preheat oven to 300°F. In a large colander set over a bowl toss eggplant with salt and let stand 1 hour. Rinse eggplant under cold water and gently squeeze by handfuls to remove excess liquid. Transfer eggplant to a large jelly-roll and toss with 2 tablespoons oil. Roast eggplant in middle of oven, shaking pan occasionally, until tender and golden, about 45 minutes, and cool. In a 4-quart kettle bring 2 quarts salted water to a boil for pasta. In a large bowl stir together eggplant, bell peppers, pine nuts, parsley, and basil. In a small bowl whisk together garlic, sugar, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. Add remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk until emulsified. Add pasta to boiling water and boil, stirring occasionally, until al dente. In colander drain pasta and rinse under cold water. Add pasta to eggplant mixture and drizzle with dressing.
