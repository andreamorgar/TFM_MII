Stir caraway seeds in large nonstick skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in oil and crushed red pepper. Add all peppers, onion, lemon peel and garlic. Increase heat to medium-high and sauté until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 7 minutes. Transfer pepper mixture to large bowl. Mix in dill. Cool. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.) Remove lemon peel. Mix in lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper and serve.
