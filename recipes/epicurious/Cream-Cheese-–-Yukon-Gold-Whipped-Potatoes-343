In heavy, medium pot combine potatoes with enough cold water to cover. Place over moderately high heat, cover, and bring to a boil. Continue boiling until potatoes are easily pierced with fork, about 15 minutes. Drain and pass through food mill or ricer into large mixing bowl. Set aside. In small saucepan over moderate heat, combine heavy cream and butter and bring to boil. Add cream mixture, sour cream, and cream cheese to potatoes, and beat until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Stir in lemon juice and salt and pepper. Serve hot.
