In a heavy saucepan cook the onion and the garlic in the oil over moderate heat, stirring, until they are golden, add the tomatoes with the juice, the sugar , the red pepper flakes, and salt to taste, and simmer the sauce, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes, or until it is thickened. (The tomato sauce may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled.)
