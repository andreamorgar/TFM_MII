Preheat oven to 425°F. Tightly wrap beets in a double layer of foil and roast on a baking sheet in middle of oven until very tender, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours. Cool in foil package until warm (the steam makes beets easier to peel), about 20 minutes. While beets are roasting, stir together vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until sugar and salt are dissolved. Cut apples into 1/4-inch dice and add to dressing along with horseradish. Toss well. When beets are cool enough to handle, slip off skins and remove stems. Cut beets into 1/4-inch dice and stir into apple mixture. Chill relish, covered, stirring occasionally, at least 2 hours (to allow flavors to develop) and up to 3 days.
