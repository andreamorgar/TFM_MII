Remove zest from oranges in long 1/2-inch-wide strips with a vegetable peeler and remove any white pith from zest. Julienne zest diagonally and transfer to a small saucepan. Cover zest with cold water and bring to a boil, then drain and repeat. Drain again and pat dry. Bring 2 cups water with sugar to a boil in a small heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Add zest and simmer, stirring occasionally, until translucent and tender, about 25 minutes. Cool zest in syrup, then drain, discarding syrup. Set on a rack over a baking sheet to catch drips and arrange zest on rack, separating strips with a fork. Dry zest 1 hour.
