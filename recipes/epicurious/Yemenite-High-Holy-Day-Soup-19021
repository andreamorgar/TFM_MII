The potatoes must be in cold water or they will turn a terrible gray color. Adult with Child: Place the beef and chicken in a large kettle with enough water to cover them.

Cook, covered, about 1 1/2 hours, or until the meat seems fairly tender. Adult: Remove the marrow bones, add the chicken, cover, and simmer another 20 minutes. Let cool and refrigerate overnight.
