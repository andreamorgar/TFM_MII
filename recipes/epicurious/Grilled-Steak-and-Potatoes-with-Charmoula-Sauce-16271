Prepare a gas grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-high heat; see Grilling Procedure . Cover potatoes with water in a saucepan and season well with salt. Simmer, partially covered, until just tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Drain potatoes, then arrange on a platter with roasted peppers. While potatoes cook, pat steak dry and season with 1 teaspoon salt. Oil grill rack, then grill steak, turning once, 10 to 12 minutes total for medium-rare. Let steak rest on a cutting board 5 minutes before thinly slicing across the grain. While steak rests, with motor running, drop garlic into a food processor and finely chop. Add cilantro and pulse until chopped. Add lemon juice, spices, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and oil. Pulse until cilantro is finely chopped and sauce comes together. Transfer charmoula to a small bowl. Arrange sliced steak, with any juices, over potatoes and peppers. Serve charmoula on the side.
