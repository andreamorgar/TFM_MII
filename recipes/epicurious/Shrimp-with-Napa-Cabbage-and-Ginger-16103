Cut white and pale green parts of scallions into 2-inch pieces and thinly slice dark green parts. Stir together shrimp, 1 tablespoon Sherry, cornstarch, white pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Rinse cabbage in a colander. Tap colander lightly, then transfer cabbage to a large bowl with excess water clinging to leaves. Heat a 14-inch wok or 12-inch heavy skillet over high heat until beginning to smoke, then add 2 tablespoons oil. When oil begins to smoke, add shrimp and stir-fry until golden and almost cooked through, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a clean bowl. Add remaining tablespoon oil to wok and heat until just smoking, then stir-fry ginger and white and pale green parts of scallions until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add bell pepper and stir-fry until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in remaining tablespoon Sherry and cook until most of liquid is evaporated. Add cabbage with water from bowl, soy sauce, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, covered, until cabbage is tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in shrimp along with any juices accumulated in bowl and simmer, uncovered, until shrimp are just cooked through, about 1 minute. Add scallion greens and toss to combine well.
