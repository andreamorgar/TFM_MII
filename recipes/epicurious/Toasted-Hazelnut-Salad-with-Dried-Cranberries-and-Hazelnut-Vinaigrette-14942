In a small saucepan heat 2 teaspoons olive oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook shallots, stirring, until golden brown. Stir in cranberries, 3 tablespoons vinegar, water, and sugar and simmer mixture, stirring occasionally, until syrupy, about 4 minutes. Transfer mixture to a bowl and cool to room temperature. In a small skillet heat 1 teaspoon olive oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook hazelnuts with salt and pepper to taste, stirring, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer nuts to a plate and cool. In a small bowl whisk together mustard and remaining tablespoon vinegar with salt and pepper to taste. In a stream whisk in hazelnut oil and remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil until emulsified. In a large bowl toss greens with just enough dressing to coat and divide among 6 plates. Sprinkle salads with cranberry mixture and hazelnuts. Serve salad with soup as a main course or align as a first course.
