Sprinkle chops with salt and pepper. Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add chops; sear just until brown, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to plate and cool. Melt butter in small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and garlic; sauté until soft, about 3 minutes. Add cumin; stir 30 seconds. Transfer to medium bowl and cool. Mix ground lamb, pork, egg, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, brandy, and Madeira into shallot mixture. Divide meat mixture into 4 equal portions. Press each meat mixture portion around each lamb chop, covering meat completely and pressing to adhere, leaving bones exposed. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Preheat oven to 450°F. Spray rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray. Place lamb chops on sheet. Roast until thermometer inserted into center of chops registers 125°F to 130°F for medium-rare, about 20 minutes. Place 1 double chop on each of 4 plates. Top each with 2 slices Tapenade Butter.
