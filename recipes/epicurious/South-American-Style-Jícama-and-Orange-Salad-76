In a large bowl whisk together the lime juice, the salt, the chili powder, and the cayenne and add the jícama, tossing it to coat it well with the dressing. Arrange the oranges decoratively around the edge of the platter and mound the jícama with a slotted spoon in the center. Drizzle the dressing remaining in the bowl over the oranges and sprinkle the scallions over the salad.
