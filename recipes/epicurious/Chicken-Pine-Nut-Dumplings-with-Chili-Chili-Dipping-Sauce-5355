Sprinkle baking sheet with flour. Mix first 10 ingredients in large bowl. Place generous 1 teaspoon chicken mixture in center of 1 wonton wrapper. Moisten edges of wrapper with water. Using fingertips, bring all corners of wrapper together over filling. Press edges of wrapper together, enclosing filling completely. Place dump-ling on baking sheet. Repeat with remaining chicken mixture and wrappers. (Can be made 2 weeks ahead. Cover tightly; freeze. Do not thaw before steaming.) Place steamer rack in large pot. Pour enough water into pot to reach depth of 1/2 inch. Spray rack with nonstick spray. Bring water to simmer. Working in batches, arrange dumplings side by side (but not touching) on rack. Cover; steam until dumplings are cooked, about 12 minutes. Line large platter with cabbage; top with dumplings. Serve with sauce.
