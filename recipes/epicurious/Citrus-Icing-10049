Beat together all ingredients in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until just combined, about 1 minute. At high speed, continue to beat until icing is thick and holds soft peaks, about 3 minutes in a stand mixer or 10 with a handheld. If not using immediately, cover surface with a dampened paper towel, then cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap.
