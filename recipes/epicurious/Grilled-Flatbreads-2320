Pour 2 cups warm water (105°-115°) into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle. Sprinkle yeast over. Let sit until yeast dissolves, about 10 minutes. Mix in 1 tablespoon oil. Add 5 cups flour and 1 tablespoon salt; beat until dough forms, about 1 minute. Transfer dough onto a floured work surface and knead until smooth, adding more flour by spoonfuls as needed for soft but still slightly sticky dough, about 5 minutes. Place dough in a large, lightly oiled bowl; turn to coat. Cover bowl with a kitchen towel and let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface. Divide into 8 equal pieces. Roll into balls; space 2" apart. Cover with a kitchen towel; let rest 15 minutes. Prepare a grill to medium-high heat. Lightly brush 4 baking sheets with oil. Working with 1 dough ball at a time, roll out into 9" round. Place 2 dough rounds on each prepared sheet. Brush lightly with oil; season with spice blend, salt, and pepper. Brush grill rack with oil. Working in batches, place flatbreads spice side down on rack. Brush with oil, season with salt and pepper, and grill until lightly charred in spots and cooked through, 1-1 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer to a work surface. Cut into wedges.
