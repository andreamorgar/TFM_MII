Toss 24 almonds, 1 teaspoon orange peel, honey, and spices in small bowl. Cut slit in each date and remove pit. Press 2 spice-coated almonds into each slit and enclose nuts in date. Line small baking sheet with foil. Melt chocolate in small microwave-safe bowl until melted, about 20 seconds, stopping once to stir. Grasp end of 1 stuffed date and dip 3/4 into melted chocolate. Shake off excess chocolate. Place date on foil. Repeat with remaining dates. Sprinkle remaining orange peel over chocolate-dipped dates. Dip 1 plain almond halfway into chocolate; place atop 1 date. Repeat with remaining almonds and dates. Chill until chocolate sets, 30 minutes.
