Bring pineapple juice to boil in large saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until reduced to 3 cups, about 20 minutes. Transfer juice to bowl; cool. Stir soy sauce into marinade. Place fish in single layer in two 15x10x2-inch glass baking dishes. Pour pineapple marinade over fish, dividing equally. Cover and refrigerate 3 hours. Preheat oven to 450°F. Spray 2 large rimmed baking sheets with nonstick spray. Remove fish from marinade; shake off excess. Reserve marinade. Place fish, flat side down, on sheets. Bake until just cooked through, about 4 minutes. Using spatula, carefully transfer to platter. Meanwhile, simmer reserved marinade in medium saucepan over medium heat until reduced to 1 cup, about 15 minutes. Brush fish with marinade. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before serving.) Sprinkle with sesame seeds; serve with cabbage salad.
