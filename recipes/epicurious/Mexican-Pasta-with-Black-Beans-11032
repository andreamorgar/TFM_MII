In a 6-quart kettle bring 5 quarts salted water to a boil for pasta. Cook pasta until tender, about 12 minutes. While pasta is cooking, in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan cook onion and garlic in oil over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until softened. Add beans, enchilada sauce, and jalapeño and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 6 minutes. Remove pan from heat and stir sour cream and salt to taste into sauce. In a colander drain pasta well and in a large bowl toss with sauce. Serve pasta sprinkled with cheese and scallions.
