Peel eggplant and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Toss with 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl and let stand 15 minutes, then rinse in a colander under cold water and squeeze out excess water. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then cook onion with bay leaf, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon oil, eggplant, and garlic and cook, stirring, until eggplant is tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add tomatoes (without juice), paprika, and cumin and cook, stirring, 3 minutes. Add reserved tomato juice, chickpeas, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt and simmer, stirring occasionally, until filling is thickened and most of liquid is evaporated, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in parsley, then discard bay leaf. Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 425°F. Line a large baking sheet with foil. Unroll phyllo and cover stack with plastic wrap and a dampened kitchen towel. Keeping remaining phyllo covered, lightly brush 1 phyllo sheet with some of remaining oil and top with 2 more sheets, brushing each with oil. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon pepper, then cut stack in half crosswise with a sharp knife. Spoon 1 cup filling into center of each half. Crumple edges of phyllo and shape into a crescent, leaving filling exposed, then transfer to baking sheet using a spatula. Make 2 more tarts in same manner, arranging about 1/2 inch apart on baking sheet. Bake, rotating baking sheet 180 degrees after 10 minutes, until edges of tarts are golden, 15 to 20 minutes total. Serve immediately.
