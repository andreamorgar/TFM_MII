Soak skewers in water while marinating beef. Cut beef into 24 (1-inch) cubes. Stir together soy sauce, lime juice, salt, and cumin in a bowl and add beef, tossing to coat well. Marinate beef, covered, at room temperature 1 hour. Prepare grill for cooking. After beef has been marinating 45 minutes, lightly brush onion rounds with oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill onion on a well-oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals, carefully turning once with a metal spatula, until lightly charred and tender, 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Transfer to a platter and keep warm. Arrange zucchini on grill and grill until lightly charred and just tender, about 1 minute on each side. Transfer to platter and season with salt. Pat beef dry with paper towels and toss with remaining oil. (Discard marinade.) Thread 4 pieces beef onto each skewer and grill, turning occasionally, until charred, about 5 minutes total for medium-rare. Serve kebabs with onion and zucchini.
