Preheat oven to 350°F. Mix oats and almonds in 13x9x2-inch baking pan. Combine 1/4 cup maple syrup and butter in heavy small saucepan. Bring to boil. Pour maple syrup mixture over oat mixture; stir to blend well. Bake 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add raisins to oat mixture; stir to blend. Bake until mixture is golden and crisp, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes longer. Cool granola completely in pan. (Can be prepared 1 week ahead. Store in airtight container at room temperature.) Gently toss strawberries, peaches and remaining 3 tablespoons maple syrup in large bowl to blend. Divide fruit mixture among 6 parfait glasses. Sprinkle each parfait with granola, dividing equally. Top each with scoop of frozen yogurt, if desired, and serve.
