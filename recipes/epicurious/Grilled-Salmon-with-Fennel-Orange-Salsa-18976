In a bowl stir together the fennel bulb and leaves, the diced orange, the olives, the capers, the juices, and salt and pepper to taste. In a small bowl stir together the oil, the lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Put the salmon on a large platter, pour the oil mixture over it, and let the salmon marinate, turning it once, for 10 minutes. Grill the salmon, skinned sides down, on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals or in a hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat for 5 minutes, turn it, and grill it for 3 minutes more, or until it is just cooked through. Arrange 4 of the radicchio leaves on each of 8 heated plates, put a piece of salmon in the center, and top it with some of the salsa.
