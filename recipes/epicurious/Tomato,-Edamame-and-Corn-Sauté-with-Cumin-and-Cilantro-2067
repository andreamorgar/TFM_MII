Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; sauté until golden, about 5 minutes. Add cumin and garlic; stir 1 minute. Add tomatoes with their juices; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook until most liquid has cooked away, about 5 minutes. Stir in edamame, corn and broth. Simmer until most broth is absorbed, about 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve.
