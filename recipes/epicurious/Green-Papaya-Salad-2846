Peel and seed papaya. Cut into large pieces and then julienne. Combine with tomato, jerky, garlic, chiles, and galangal in a large bowl. Stir together lime juice, fish sauce, and sugar in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved and toss with papaya mixture. Mound salad on a platter and serve with lettuce leaves for wrapping.
