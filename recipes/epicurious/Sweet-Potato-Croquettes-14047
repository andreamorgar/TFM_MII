Steam yams until tender, about 15 minutes. Place in large bowl. Add sugar and vanilla and mash well. Mix in yolk and cornflake crumbs. Line baking sheet with foil. Place flour in medium bowl. With floured hands, shape 1 round tablespoonful of yam mixture into 1 1/2-round; roll in flour to coat completely. Place on prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining yam mixture. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.) Pour vegetable oil into medium saucepan to depth of 1 1/2 inches. Heat oil to 350°F. Fry croquettes in batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer croquettes to paper towels and drain. Arrange croquettes on platter. Dust with powdered sugar. Serve with honey.
