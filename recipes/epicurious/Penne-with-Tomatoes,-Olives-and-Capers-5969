Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add garlic and sauté until pale golden, about 2 minutes. Add tomatoes and olives. Sauté until tomatoes begin to release their juice, about 5 minutes. Add Port and next 6 ingredients. Simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 6 minutes. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain. Transfer to large bowl. Pour sauce over pasta; toss. Garnish with additional basil. Serve, passing Parmesan separately.
