Heat ghee in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add scallions, chiles, garlic, and mustard seeds. Cook, stirring often, until garlic begins to brown and mustard seeds pop, about 1 minute. Add spinach to skillet by the handful, allowing it to wilt between additions. Cook, tossing often, until spinach is tender, 5-8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
