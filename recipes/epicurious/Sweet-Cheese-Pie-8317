Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Butter a 9-inch glass pie plate. Stir together crumbs, butter, 2 tablespoons sugar, and salt with a rubber spatula until combined well. Press crumbs evenly onto bottom and side of pie plate. Chill crust 10 minutes. Stir together remaining ingredients (including 1/2 cup sugar), then pour into crust. Bake until filling is puffed, pale golden, and lightly set, about 1 hour. Cool to warm on a rack, about 30 minutes.
