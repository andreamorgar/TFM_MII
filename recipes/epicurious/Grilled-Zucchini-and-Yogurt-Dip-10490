Prepare grill. Cut zucchini lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices and grill on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals until very tender, about 5 minutes on each side. Mince garlic with salt and mash to a paste. Finely chop zucchini and stir into garlic paste with remaining ingredients. Serve dip with bruschetta.
