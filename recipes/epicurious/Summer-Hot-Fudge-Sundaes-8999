Stir first 4 ingredients in heavy small saucepan over low heat until melted and smooth. Add rum. Strain, pressing on solids to extract as much flavor as possible. (Can be prepared 5 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over low heat before using, stirring constantly and thinning with more cream if necessary.) Combine first 5 ingredients in medium bowl. Stir gently. Let stand for 15 to 30 minutes. Scoop ice cream into sundae or balloon glasses. Top with warm sauce, then fruits and nuts and serve.
