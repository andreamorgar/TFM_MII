Heat oil in heavy large Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Add onions, carrot, fennel, cinnamon stick, cumin, ginger, turmeric and saffron; sauté until vegetables begin to soften, about 10 minutes. Add potatoes, broth and raisins; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer until potatoes are almost tender, about 10 minutes. Add garbanzo beans, zucchini and tomatoes; cover and simmer until zucchini is tender, about 8 minutes longer. Transfer ragout to bowl. Sprinkle with almonds, if desired.
