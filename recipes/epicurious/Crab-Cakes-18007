In a small bowl whisk together mayonnaise, Old Bay seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste and stir into crab mixture until combined well. Line a baking sheet with wax paper. Form crab mixture into 6 flattened rounds, each about 3 inches wide and 3/4 inches thick, and transfer to baking sheet.

In a heavy skillet heat 1 tablespoon butter over moderate heat until foam subsides and cook half of crab cakes until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Cook remaining cakes in remaining tablespoon butter in same manner. Serve crab cakes warm with lemon wedges. Makes 6 cakes.
