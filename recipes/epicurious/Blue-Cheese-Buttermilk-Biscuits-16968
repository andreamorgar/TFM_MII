Mix in 3/4 cup cheese, chives, and 1 1/2 teaspoons thyme. Make well in center; add 1 cup buttermilk and stir until dough forms, gradually mixing in dry ingredients. Turn dough out onto floured work surface. Knead gently until combined, about 5 turns. Pat dough into 1-inch-thick rectangle. Cut into 8 squares. Transfer squares to baking sheet. Brush with 1 tablespoon buttermilk. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup cheese and 1 1/2 teaspoons thyme. Sprinkle with pepper. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover; chill.)
