Put potatoes and kosher salt in a large heavy saucepan and generously cover with cold water. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain well and return to saucepan. Meanwhile, heat milk and butter in a small saucepan until butter is melted and milk is hot but not boiling. Add milk mixture, along with horseradish and pepper, to potatoes and mash with a potato masher or fork (to desired consistency). Season with salt and serve warm.
