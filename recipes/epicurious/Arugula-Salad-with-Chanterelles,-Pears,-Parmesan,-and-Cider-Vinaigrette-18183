Whisk together vinegar, honey, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 3/4 teaspoon pepper, and 1 tablespoon shallot in a small bowl and let stand 10 minutes. Add 6 tablespoons oil in a slow stream, whisking. Heat remaining tablespoon oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté chanterelles, stirring, until crisp-tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Add remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 3/4 teaspoon pepper, and tablespoon shallot and sauté, stirring, 5 seconds. Remove from heat and keep warm, covered. Halve, core, and very thinly slice pear lengthwise, then divide slices among 8 salad plates. Toss arugula with just enough vinaigrette to lightly coat and mound in centers of plates. Arrange chanterelles around arugula. Shave 6 or 8 curls from cheese with a vegetable peeler onto each salad. Drizzle salads with some of remaining vinaigrette.
