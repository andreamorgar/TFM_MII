Place cabbage wedges on a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with oil, getting between layers as much as possible. Season generously with salt. Let sit at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours. Prepare a grill for medium-high, indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off). Grill jalapeños over direct heat, turning occasionally, until blistered and beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Let cool slightly, then chop. Transfer to a medium bowl and add buttermilk, yogurt, mayonnaise, lemon zest and juice, and 1 Tbsp. chives. Mix well; season dressing with salt and pepper. Grill cabbage, starting over direct heat, then moving to indirect and covering grill if needed to prevent scorching, until crisp-tender, 15–20 minutes. Serve topped with dressing, blue cheese, and more chives. Dressing can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.
