Place the strawberries and sugar in a food processor and pulse just until the mixture is finely chopped and juicy but still chunky; you don't want a smooth purée. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the balsamic vinegar and a few grinds of pepper. Spoon the mixture into ice pop molds and insert sticks. Freeze until firm, at least 6 hours or up to 1 week. To unmold the pops, run hot water over the outsides of the molds for a few seconds, then gently pull the sticks.
