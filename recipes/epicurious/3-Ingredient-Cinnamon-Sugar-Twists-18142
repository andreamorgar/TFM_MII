Arrange racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 400°F. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment. Mix sugar, cinnamon, and salt on a large plate. Fill a small bowl or glass with cold water. Roll out pastry between 2 sheets of parchment until short side is 10" long and dough is about 1/8" thick. Freeze dough 5 minutes. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, cut dough crosswise into 1" strips. Transfer half of strips to refrigerator. Working one at a time, brush strip lightly with water (or use your fingertips), then immediately transfer to sugar mixture and turn to coat. Starting from the middle, use both hands to twist dough to the ends. Transfer to prepared sheet, arranging twists vertically. Repeat with remaining dough. Freeze 10 minutes. Bake twists, rotating sheets front to back and top to bottom halfway through, until golden brown and beginning to caramelize, 18–20 minutes. Using tongs, immediately lift twists from parchment and let cool with 1 end on rim of baking sheet (work carefully, sugar coating will be very hot).
