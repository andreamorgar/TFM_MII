In a kettle combine potatoes with enough salted cold water to cover by 2 inches and boil potatoes until very tender, about 30 minutes. Drain potatoes in a colander, and, when just cool enough to handle, peel potatoes. Return warm potatoes to kettle and with a potato masher mash potatoes with milk over very low heat. Chop chiles and mash into potatoes with sour cream and salt and pepper to taste. Potatoes may be made up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Reheat potatoes, covered, in a 350°F. oven about 30 minutes and season with salt and pepper. Chop cilantro and stir into potatoes.
