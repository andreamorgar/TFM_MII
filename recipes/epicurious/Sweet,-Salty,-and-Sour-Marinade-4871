Stir palm sugar and 3 tablespoons water in a small saucepan over low heat until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat. Combine lime juice, fish sauce, and 3 tablespoons water in a medium bowl. Whisk in 1/3 cup palm sugar syrup (reserve remaining syrup for glaze). Stir in cilantro, ginger, chiles, and lemongrass. Put pork or seafood in a glass, stainless-steel, or ceramic dish. Toss with marinade. Cover; chill for at least 3 hours or overnight. Remove pork or seafood from marinade, pat dry, and grill. Simmer marinade and reserved palm sugar syrup in a small saucepan until reduced to 3/4 cup. Brush glaze onto meat or fish during the last few minutes of grilling.
