1. Place the potatoes and chicken in a large pot; cover with salted water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are soft and the chicken thighs are cooked through, about 15 minutes, skimming any foam that rises to the top. (The potatoes should be soft but not cooked through.) 2. In the meantime, prepare coals in a barbecue grill with a fitted lid. Place the seaweed and corn in a very large bowl of water and soak thoroughly, about 20 to 30 minutes. 3. When the coals are ready, they will be red in the center and the edges will be ash. Place a layer of seaweed (about 4 inches deep) over the entire grill. Place the lobsters in the center of the seaweed and surround with the corn. Arrange the potatoes, chicken and sausage in layers atop the lobsters. Top with the clams. Cover completely with the remaining seaweed. Cover the grill with the lid and cook for 45 minutes or until the lobster is steaming and red. 4. Serve immediately with drawn butter, if desired.
