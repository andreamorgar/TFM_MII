Sprinkle gelatin over cold water in a small saucepan and let soften 1 minute. Cook over low heat, stirring, until gelatin is dissolved, about 1 minute, then remove from heat. Beat together yolks, sugar, brandy, salt, and 1/4 cup cream in a metal bowl with a handheld electric mixer at medium-high speed until combined well. Set bowl over a saucepan of simmering water and cook mixture, beating constantly at medium-high speed, until very thick and registers 160°F on thermometer, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove bowl from heat, then beat in gelatin mixture until just combined. Cool sabayon 5 minutes. Beat remaining 2 cups cream with cleaned beaters until it just holds stiff peaks. Stir one fourth of whipped cream into sabayon to lighten, then fold in remaining cream gently but thoroughly. Spoon layers of mousse and lingonberry sauce alternately into 8 (6- to 8-ounce) stemmed glasses and chill, covered, until set, at least 2 hours.
