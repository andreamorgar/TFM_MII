In a small saucepan combine sauce ingredients and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved. In a blender or food processor puree sauce and strain through a fine sieve into a bowl. Finely chop scallions. Arrange tortillas on a work surface and divide Havarti, turkey, bacon, and scallions evenly between them. Drizzle some chipotle sauce over filling and gently roll up tortillas. In a lightly oiled skillet toast rolls, starting with seam sides down, over moderately high heat, turning them, until golden on all sides, about 3 minutes. Diagonally halve tortillas crosswise and serve remaining sauce separately.
