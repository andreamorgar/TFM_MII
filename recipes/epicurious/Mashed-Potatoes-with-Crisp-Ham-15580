Cover potatoes with cold water in a 3-to 4-quart saucepan and add 1/2 teaspoon salt. Simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, melt butter with oil in a heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat, then cook ham, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in scallions and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook 2 minutes. Reserve 1 cup potato-cooking liquid, then drain potatoes and mash. Stir in ham mixture along with enough cooking liquid to reach desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.
