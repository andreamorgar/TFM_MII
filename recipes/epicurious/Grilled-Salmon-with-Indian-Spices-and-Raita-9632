Prepare grill (medium-high heat). Purée ginger, 1/4 cup oil, 1 tablespoon garam masala, garlic, coriander, and cumin in a blender until coarse purée forms. Put salmon into a baking dish and season with salt and pepper. Coat salmon with ginger pureée. Let marinate at room temperature for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, stir yogurt, cucumber, cilantro, scallions, lime juice, and remaining 1 teaspoon garam masala in a medium bowl. Season raita to taste with salt and pepper. Brush the grill rack with oil. Brush off marinade for easier grilling, or leave it on for a better crust. Grill salmon, turning once, until it just begins to flake in center, 4-5 minutes per side. Transfer salmon to a platter. Garnish with cilantro. Serve with raita.
