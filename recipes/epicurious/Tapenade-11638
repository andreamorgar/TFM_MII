Heat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and sauté for 5 minutes, or until just beginning to color. Add the red, yellow, and green bell peppers and sauté for another 10 minutes, or just until the peppers soften. Stir in the olives, walnuts, parsley, and basil. When well blended, add the vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and pack the mixture into the sterilized containers. Spoon 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil on the top of the mixture in each container. Cover and set aside to cool before refrigerating.
