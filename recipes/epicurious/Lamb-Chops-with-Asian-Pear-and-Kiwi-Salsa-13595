Preheat broiler. Brush chops lightly on both sides with remaining 1 tablespoon honey; sprinkle with salt, pepper and remaining 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint. Broil chops until cooked to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Combine pears, kiwis, cranberries, onions and lemon juice in medium bowl; mix in 2 tablespoons honey and 2 tablespoons chopped mint. Season salsa to taste with salt and pepper. Let stand 30 minutes, tossing occasionally. Transfer 2 lamb chops to each plate. Spoon salsa alongside and serve.
