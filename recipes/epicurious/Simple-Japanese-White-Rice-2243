Put rice in a bowl and wash in several changes of cold water until water is clear. Drain in a sieve 15 minutes. Soak rice in water (3 cups) in a 4-quart heavy pot 30 minutes. Cover pot with lid and bring rice just to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, until water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes (avoid lifting lid). Remove from heat; let stand, covered, 10 minutes. Stir gently with a heatproof rubber spatula, folding from top to bottom of pot.
