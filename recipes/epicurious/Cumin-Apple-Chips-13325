Preheat oven to 200°F and line a large baking sheet with baking pad or parchment. Sift together confectioners sugar and cumin twice to evenly incorporate. Sift half of cumin sugar evenly onto baking sheet. Cut apple crosswise into very thin round slices (about 1/16 inch thick) with slicer. Arrange 20 of largest slices nearly touching each other on baking sheet, then evenly sift remaining cumin sugar over apples. (Reserve remaining apple slices for another use.) Bake slices in middle of oven until pale golden and beginning to crisp, about 1 1/2 hours. Immediately peel chips off pad and cool on a rack. Available in most cookware shops.
