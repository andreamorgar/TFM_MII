Cut tenderloin crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Pound between sheets of waxed paper to thickness of 1/4 inch. Combine flour, salt and pepper in shallow dish. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Dredge pork in seasoned flour, shaking off excess. Add 1/3 of pork to skillet and sauté until brown and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to platter and keep warm. Repeat with remaining pork in 2 more batches, adding 1 tablespoon butter to skillet for each batch. Add white parts of green onions to skillet. Sauté until just tender, about 1 minute. Stir in white wine and boil until liquid is reduced to 2 tablespoons, about 3 minutes. Add whipping cream and simmer until thickened to sauce, about 5 minutes. Whisk in 1/4 cup Dijon mustard. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon sauce over pork. Garnish tenderloin with remaining green onions and serve.
