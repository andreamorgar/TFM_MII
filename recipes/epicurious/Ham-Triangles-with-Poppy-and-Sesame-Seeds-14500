Stir together ham, mayonnaise, chutney, mustard, and salt to taste. Put sesame and poppy seeds in 2 separate shallow bowls. Divide bread into 4 stacks. Trim stacks into 2 1/2-inch squares with a serrated knife, discarding crusts. Put 8 bread squares on a work surface in 1 layer, then divide ham mayonnaise among them, spreading evenly to edges. Top each with a plain bread square. Diagonally halve each sandwich with serrated knife. Spread a thin layer of butter on cut edges of both short sides of 1 triangle, then dip 1 buttered side in sesame seeds and the other in poppy seeds. Put, unseeded side down, on a platter, then coat remaining sandwiches in same manner.
