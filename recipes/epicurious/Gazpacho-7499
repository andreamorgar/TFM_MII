Combine 1/4 cup chopped tomatoes, 1/4 cup chopped cucumber and chopped parsley in small bowl; stir to blend. Set aside for garnish. Combine bread mixture, remaining tomatoes, remaining cucumber, red bell pepper and next 5 ingredients in large bowl; stir to blend.

(Can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Keep refrigerated.) Ladle gazpacho into bowls. Garnish with reserved tomato-cucumber mixture. Serve well chilled.
