Halve fennel bulb lengthwise and core it, then cut into 1/4-inch dice. Cook fennel in 2 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until tender, about 15 minutes. Transfer fennel to a bowl and stir in pomegranate seeds, scallions, cilantro, vinegar, honey, and salt. Pat pork chops dry and season with salt and pepper. Heat remaining tablespoon oil in skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté chops until deep golden and just cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Transfer chops to plates and let stand, loosely covered, 5 minutes. Serve chops topped with salsa.
