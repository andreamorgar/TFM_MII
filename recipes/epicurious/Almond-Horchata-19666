In a blender combine all horchata ingredients except ice and let stand in blender 5 minutes. Blend mixture on low speed and gradually work up to high speed (use caution when blending hot liquids). Blend mixture on high speed 3 minutes. Add 2 cups ice and blend until melted. Pour mixture through a large sieve lined with a double layer of dampened cheesecloth into a bowl, stirring, and discard solids. Fill 4 tall glasses with additional ice and horchata and garnish with cinnamon sticks and lime zest. Flavor of horchata improves if made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
