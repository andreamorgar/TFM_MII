1. Dissolve the yeast in a mixture of 2 cups water and the honey in a bowl; let stand until frothy to activate the yeast. Add the sun-dried tomatoes, oil, whole wheat flour, unbleached flour, garlic powder and salt; mix with a mixer or by hand. Knead on a floured surface for 5 minutes or until smooth and elastic. 2. Place in an oiled bowl, turning to coat the surface. Let rise, covered, in a warm place until doubled in bulk. Divide into 10 portions and shape into balls. Flatten into buns and place on a baking sheet lightly sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle with cornmeal, brush with the egg white mixture and sprinkle with the sesame seeds. 3. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Bake the buns for 25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to a wire rack and cool for 5 minutes before slicing to fill.
