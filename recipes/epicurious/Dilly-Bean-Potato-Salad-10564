Place shallots in a small bowl. Stir in 6 tablespoons red wine vinegar and a large pinch of salt; set aside. Cook potatoes in a large saucepan of boiling salted water until just tender, about 30 minutes. Drain potatoes well; transfer to a large bowl. Lightly crush potatoes with the back of a large spoon; transfer to a large bowl. Add shallot-vinegar mixture to hot potatoes and toss to incorporate. Season with salt and pepper. Whisk 1 cup mayonnaise and smoked paprika in a small bowl; add to potatoes and toss to combine. Fold in watercress, beans, and eggs and season to taste with salt, pepper, and more vinegar, if desired. Garnish with parsley. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Return to room temperature before serving, if desired, stirring in additional mayonnaise if dry.
