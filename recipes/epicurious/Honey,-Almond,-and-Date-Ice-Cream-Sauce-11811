In a small saucepan cook the almonds in the butter over moderate heat, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until the almonds begin to color, add the honey, and bring the liquid to a boil. Stir in the dates, the cream, the lemon juice, the almond extract, and the salt and stir the mixture until it is combined well. Serve the sauce warm over ice cream. The sauce can be kept, covered and chilled, for 1 month.
