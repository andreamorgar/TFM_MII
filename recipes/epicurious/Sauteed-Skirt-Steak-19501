Preheat oven to 450°F. Brush steak with Worcestershire and marinate 15 minutes. Lightly pat steaks dry and season well with salt. Heat 1/2 tablespoon of oil in each of 2 (12-inch) nonstick or heavy skillets over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté steaks in batches, without crowding, 3 minutes on each side for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to a platter and let stand, loosely covered, 5 minutes.
