Cook potatoes and carrots in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 10 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a large platter and keep warm, covered loosely with foil. Add beans to simmering water and cook until just tender, 3 to 6 minutes. Drain beans in a colander and arrange on platter. Halve eggs and arrange on platter. Cook anchovies and garlic in oil in a medium nonstick skillet over moderate heat, mashing anchovies with back of a fork, until anchovies are disintegrated and garlic is fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add cream and boil, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes, then season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a sauceboat and serve with vegetables and eggs.
