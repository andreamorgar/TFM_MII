Bring wine, 1 cup sugar, and cinnamon to boil in large saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves. Boil until reduced to 1 cup, about 18 minutes. Cool syrup completely. Cover and chill until cold. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.) Finely grate peel from 2 oranges. Mix peel and 1 tablespoon sugar in small bowl. Using small sharp knife, cut off peel and white pith from all oranges. Working over large bowl, cut between membranes to release segments. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover orange segments and sugared peel separately and chill.) Divide oranges and juice among 8 bowls. Drizzle syrup over and sprinkle with sugared orange peel.
