Preheat oven to 350°F. Place bay leaves in 15x10x2-inch glass baking dish. Place ham steaks side by side in dish, overlapping slightly if necessary. Pour 1 1/2 cups apple cider over ham steaks (cider will not cover steaks). Whisk 2 tablespoons maple syrup and mustard in small bowl to blend; spread over top of ham steaks, dividing equally. Sprinkle with pepper. Bake ham steaks 40 minutes. Meanwhile, combine 1 cup apple cider, 1 tablespoon maple syrup and Madeira in medium saucepan. Boil until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 15 minutes. Spoon sauce over ham and serve.
