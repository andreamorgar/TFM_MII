Cook pasta in medium pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain pasta; rinse under cold water and drain well. Grate enough lemon peel to measure 1/2 teaspoon. Squeeze enough juice from lemon to measure 1 1/2 tablespoons. Place lemon peel and juice in medium bowl. Whisk in oil. Mix in carrot, radishes and chives, then pasta. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Let stand 10 minutes to blend flavors.
