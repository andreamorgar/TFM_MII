In a metal bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water melt chocolate, stirring until smooth. In a heavy saucepan bring cream and milk just to a boil. In a bowl whisk together yolks and sugar until combined well and whisk in cream mixture in a stream. Pour mixture into pan and cook over moderately low heat, stirring, until it registers 170°F. on a candy thermometer. Strain custard through a fine sieve into a bowl and whisk in melted chocolate, vanilla, and brandy until smooth. Cool custard completely and freeze in an ice-cream maker, adding marrons glacés during last few minutes of freezing time.
