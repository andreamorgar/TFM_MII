Preheat oven to 350°F. Peel parsnips and halve each crosswise where it becomes narrow. Diagonally cut narrow portions into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Quarter wider portions lengthwise and core, then diagonally cut flesh into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Toss parsnips and carrots with oil, salt, pepper, rosemary, and sage in a large bowl. Spread in a large shallow baking pan (1 inch deep) and pour in water. Roast vegetables in lower third of oven until tender, 50 to 55 minutes.
