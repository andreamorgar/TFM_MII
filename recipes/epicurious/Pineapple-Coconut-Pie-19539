Preheat oven to 325°F. Flatten crust on lightly floured surface; press seams together if necessary. Fit into 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish; crimp edges. Arrange pineapple in crust. Combine sugar, flour and salt in medium bowl. Add eggs and butter and blend well. Pour batter evenly over pineapple. Sprinkle coconut and nuts over and press lightly into batter. Bake until light brown and center is firm to touch, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool completely.
