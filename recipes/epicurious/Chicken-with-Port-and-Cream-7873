Lightly flour the chicken and sauté it in the butter, turning it to color very lightly on all sides. Do not let it brown. Add salt and spice. Add 1 cup port, cover pan and simmer gently for 15 minutes, or until tender. Remove chicken to a hot platter, add 1/2 cup port to pan juices and reduce over a high flame for 3 to 4 minutes. Lower heat and stir in heavy cream mixed with egg yolks. Cook very gently, stirring constantly until slightly thickened but do not let the sauce boil. Taste for seasoning. Pour sauce over chicken. Serve with a rice pilaf. With this, drink a California Sauvignon Blanc.
