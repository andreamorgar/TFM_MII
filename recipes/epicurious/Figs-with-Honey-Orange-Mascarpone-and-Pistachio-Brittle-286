Line baking sheet with foil. Stir sugar and 1 tablespoon water in small skillet over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium-high; boil until syrup turns deep amber, occasionally swirling skillet and brushing down sides with wet pastry brush, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; add salt and nuts. Stir to coat and transfer to prepared sheet. Cool. Stir mascarpone, cream, honey, and orange peel in small bowl. Coarsely chop brittle. Arrange figs on plate. Spoon 1 teaspoonful mascarpone mixture atop cut side of each fig; garnish with brittle.
