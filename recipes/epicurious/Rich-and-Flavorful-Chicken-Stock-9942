Bring all ingredients to a boil with 1 teaspoon salt in an 8- to 10-quart pot. Skim froth. Reduce heat and cook at a bare simmer, uncovered, skimming froth occasionally, 3 1/2 hours. 3Pour stock through a large sieve lined with dampened paper towels into a large bowl, discarding solids. If using stock right away, skim off and discard fat. If not, chill stock, uncovered, until cool, then cover; discard solidified fat before using stock.
