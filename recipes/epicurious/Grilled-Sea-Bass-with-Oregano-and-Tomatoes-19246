Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Mix 2 tablespoons oil and half of minced garlic in small bowl. Brush garlic oil on both sides of fish. Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and remaining garlic; sauté 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and next 6 ingredients. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook 5 minutes to blend flavors. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Remove from heat. Cover and keep warm. Grill fish just until opaque in center, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to plates. Top with sauce and serve.
