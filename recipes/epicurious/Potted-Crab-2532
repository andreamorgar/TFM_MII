Crack crab shells with kitchen shears and extract meat. Cut enough crab into 1/2-inch pieces to measure 1/2 cup and transfer to a bowl. Pulse remaining crab in a food processor to finely chop (do not over process). Add to bowl with remaining ingredients and stir well. Season with salt to taste. Pack into a 1 1/2 cup crock or bowl and cover surface with plastic wrap. Chill at least 2 hours. Bring to room temperature before serving.
