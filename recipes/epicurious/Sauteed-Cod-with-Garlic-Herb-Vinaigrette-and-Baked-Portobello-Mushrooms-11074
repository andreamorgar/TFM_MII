Gradually whisk in olive oil. Season vinaigrette to taste with sea salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Vinaigrette can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Preheat oven to 400°F. Brush mushrooms all over with olive oil. Place mushrooms, rounded side down, on foil-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle with sea salt and pepper, then chopped garlic. Arrange 2 rosemary sprigs and 2 thyme sprigs on each. Roast mushrooms until tender, about 25 minutes. Sprinkle fish with sea salt and pepper; dust lightly with flour. Heat canola oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add fish and sauté until brown and just opaque in center, about 5 minutes per side. Whisk vinaigrette over low heat to warm slightly. Thinly slice each mushroom on slight diagonal; overlap slices in row on 1 side of each plate. Spoon vinaigrette onto opposite side of plate; top with fish.
