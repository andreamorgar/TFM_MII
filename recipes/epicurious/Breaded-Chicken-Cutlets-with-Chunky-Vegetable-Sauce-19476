Preheat oven to 400°F. Place vegetables on large rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Drizzle oil over; toss to coat. Roast vegetables until tender and brown around edges, turning occasionally, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven. Increase oven temperature to 500°F. Meanwhile, spray large nonstick baking sheet with oil spray. Place breadcrumbs on sheet of waxed paper. Whisk egg whites in shallow bowl until foamy. Using mallet, pound chicken breasts to 1/3-inch thickness. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Turn chicken in breadcrumbs; place on platter. Stir Parmesan into remaining breadcrumbs on waxed paper. Dip chicken into egg whites to coat. Then dip chicken into Parmesan breadcrumbs to coat; shake off excess. Transfer vegetables to bowl; mix in parsley and thyme. Add broth to baking sheet; scrape up any browned bits. Pour over vegetables. Keep warm. Bake chicken on prepared sheet 5 minutes. Turn chicken over; bake just until cooked through, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to plates. Spoon vegetable sauce alongside.
