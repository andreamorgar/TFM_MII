Blend mayonnaise and seafood seasoning in medium bowl. Mix in celery and onion. Add crabmeat and stir gently to combine without breaking up crabmeat. Season to taste with pepper. Place bottoms of rolls on plates. Mound half of crab salad, then lettuce on each. Set tops of rolls over and press sandwiches slightly to compact.
