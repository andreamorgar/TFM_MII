1. Prepare the meatballs: Combine all the ingredients in a bowl. Form into 24 meatballs, about 1 1D2 inches in diameter. 2. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat and cook the meatballs in batches, shaking the pan occasionally, for about 10 to 12 minutes or until browned and cooked through. Add more oil if necessary. Remove the meatballs to a paper towel to drain. 3. Warm the tomato sauce over medium heat in another skillet. Add the meatballs and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, spooning sauce over them. 4. To serve, spoon about 1/4 cup of tomato sauce into each roll, coating well; spoon 3 meatballs into each bread. Wrap the sandwiches in foil for the road.
