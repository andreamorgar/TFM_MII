Preheat oven to 375°F. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté until deep brown, about 8 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. Mix in clam juice, then 4 tablespoons anise liqueur, garlic and 1 teaspoon herbs. Boil until most liquid evaporates, about 3 minutes. Set aside. Lightly oil large baking sheet. Place salmon, skin side down, on prepared sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Whisk remaining 1 tablespoon oil, 2 tablespoons anise liqueur and 1 teaspoon herbs in bowl to blend; drizzle over salmon. Bake until just opaque in center, about 20 minutes. Top with onion mixture.
