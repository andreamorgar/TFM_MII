Preheat oven to 425°F. On a lightly floured surface with a floured rolling pin roll out pastry into a rectangle roughly 17 by 15 inches and trim edges to form a 16- by 14-inch rectangle. Halve pastry lengthwise, forming two 16- by 7-inch rectangles. Brush edges with water and fold in edges to form a 1/2-inch wide border on each rectangle. With tines of a fork press border to seal. Transfer rectangles to a large baking sheet. Divide anchovy paste between rectangle and spread in a very thin, even layer. Sprinkle each tart evenly with 1/2 cup mozzarella and 2 tablespoons Parmesan. Arrange tomato slices in one layer on cheese. Scatter onion slices and herbs over tomatoes and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan and salt and pepper to taste. Bake tarts in upper third of oven 12 to 15 minutes, or until crust is golden. Tarts may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered loosely. Reheat tarts before serving. Serve tarts warm or at room temperature.
