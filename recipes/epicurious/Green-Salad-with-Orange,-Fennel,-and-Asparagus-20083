In small bowl, whisk together vinegar, mustard, sugar, salt, and pepper. Gradually whisk in oil, then zest. In large sauté pan, bring 1 inch water to boil. Add asparagus and simmer until bright green, about 1 minute. Drain in colander, then rinse under cold running water until cool. Thinly slice on diagonal and transfer to large bowl. Cut peel and white pith from oranges. Working over medium bowl, cut between membranes to release segments. Add segments and any juice in medium bowl to large bowl with asparagus; squeeze juice from membranes into dressing and whisk to combine. Add fennel and then salad greens to large bowl. Drizzle with dressing and toss gently. Sprinkle chives on top and serve immediately.
