Heat a cooker to medium to medium-high. Combine all the ingredients for the rub in a small bowl and blend. Rub all over the ribs. Oil the grate and place the ribs on it bone side down over direct heat. Cover and cook for 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours, or until pull-apart tender, turning and spraying with apple juice every 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer the ribs to a cutting board and let them rest, covered loosely with aluminum foil, for 10 to 15 minutes. Cut the ribs into individual pieces and serve with barbecue sauce.
