Preheat oven to 350°F and grease 2 (9-inch) tart pans with removable bottoms. Pulse butter, flour, brown sugar, and salt in a food processor until mixture begins to form small lumps. Divide between tart pans and press onto bottoms and up sides. Bake in middle of oven until pale golden, about 20 minutes. Leave oven on. Peel, quarter, and core apples. Cut quarters crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices and toss with flour, lemon juice, and 1 cup sugar. Toss bread crumbs with melted butter. Remove tart pans from oven and divide apple mixture between crusts, gently shaking pans to settle apples. Sprinkle crumbs evenly over tarts and sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup sugar over crumbs. Bake tarts in middle of oven, placing a sheet of foil on rack below to catch any drips, until apples are tender and crumbs are golden brown, about 1 hour.
