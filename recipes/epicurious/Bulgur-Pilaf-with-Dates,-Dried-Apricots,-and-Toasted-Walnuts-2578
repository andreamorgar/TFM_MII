Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until golden, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; stir 1 minute. Add bulgur and sauté 5 minutes. Stir in dates, apricots, cinnamon stick, and curry powder. Add broth; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer until bulgur is tender and broth is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Stir in green onions. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer pilaf to bowl. Sprinkle with walnuts and serve. Bulgur, or cracked wheat, is available at natural foods stores and supermarkets.
