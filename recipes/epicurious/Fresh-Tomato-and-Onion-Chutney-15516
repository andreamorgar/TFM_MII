Soak onion with 1/2 teaspoon sea salt in 1 cup cold water 15 minutes, then drain well in a sieve. Transfer to a bowl and stir in tomatoes, jalapeño, lemon juice, and orange juice. Cook ginger, mustard seeds, and turmeric in oil in a small skillet over moderately low heat, stirring, until seeds begin to pop, about 2 minutes. Stir into tomatoes with pepper and remaining 1/2 teaspoon sea salt, then let stand at least 1 hour for flavors to develop. Just before serving, drain chutney in a sieve set over a bowl, discarding liquid.
