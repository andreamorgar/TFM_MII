Cook pasta in pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain. Return to pot. Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add radicchio, prosciutto, and figs; sauté until radicchio is just wilted, about 2 minutes. Add mixture to pasta. Add half of blue cheese and half of parsley. Season pasta lightly with salt and generously with pepper; toss gently. Divide pasta between 2 plates. Sprinkle with remaining blue cheese and parsley and serve.
