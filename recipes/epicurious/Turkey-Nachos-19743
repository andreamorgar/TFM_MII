Preheat oven to 450°F. Toss turkey with lime juice and season with salt and pepper. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté bell peppers, stirring, until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Heat remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil in skillet over moderate heat and cook garlic, cumin, and oregano, stirring, 1 minute. Stir in beans and cook, stirring, until heated through, about 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper. Make 2 layers each of corn chips, sautéed peppers, beans, turkey, cheese, scallion, and cilantro in a 3-quart shallow baking dish. Bake nachos in middle of oven until cheese is melted, 6 to 10 minutes. Stir together sour cream and jalapeño to taste and serve on the side along with salsa.
