If using duck leg, peel off skin and reserve. Remove meat from bones, discarding bones, and shred meat. Cut reserved duck skin into thin strips and in a small non-stick skillet cook over moderate heat until fat is rendered and skin is crisp and golden brown. Transfer cracklings with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and season with salt. With a sharp knife peel celery root and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Thinly slice shallots and chop celery ribs. In an 8-quart heavy kettle cook vegetables in butter with salt and pepper to taste over moderately high heat, stirring, until golden, about 6 minutes. Add water and boil, uncovered, until celery root is very tender, about 15 minutes. In a blender purée mixture in batches (use caution when blending hot liquids) until smooth, transferring to a large saucepan. Stir in lemon juice and, if necessary, more water to reach desired consistency. Season soup with salt and pepper and keep warm. In a non-stick skillet heat duck meat over moderate heat, stirring, just until hot and season with salt and pepper. In a bowl whisk cream just until stiff peaks form. Serve bisque topped with duck meat, cracklings, and a dollop of whipped cream.
