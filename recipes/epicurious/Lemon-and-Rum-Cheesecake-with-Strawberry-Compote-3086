Using floured hands, gather dough into ball. Press dough over bottom and 1 inch up sides of prepared pan. Cover pan tightly with plastic wrap. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until slightly puffy, about 2 hours 15 minutes. Preheat oven to 350°F. Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese, sugar, and flour in large bowl until well blended. Beat in eggs 1 at a time.
