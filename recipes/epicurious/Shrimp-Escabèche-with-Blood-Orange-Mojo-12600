Combine orange juice, lemon juice, and 2 minced garlic cloves in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add pinch of salt; boil until orange juice mixture is reduced to 1 cup, about 15 minutes. Cool. Mix in crushed red pepper. Mix shrimp, bell pepper, celery, red onion, cilantro, and 1/4 cup olive oil in bowl. Toss with orange juice mixture and remaining minced garlic clove. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and chill until cold, about 2 hours. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Keep refrigerated.) Arrange escabeche in shallow bowl. Drizzle with additional olive oil, if desired. Garnish with lemon wedges. Serve with tortilla chips or pita chips.
