Shake mustard seeds in medium skillet over low heat until seeds begin to pop, about 2 minutes. Transfer seeds to bowl. Mix in applesauce, 1 tablespoon yogurt, 2 tablespoons chutney, 2 teaspoons curry powder, salt and cayenne. Mix in turkey, 4 tablespoons onion tops and 4 tablespoons mint. Shape into four 3/4-inch-thick patties. Mix apple, 3/4 cup yogurt, 3 tablespoons chutney, 3/4 teaspoon curry powder, 3 tablespoons onion tops and 3 tablespoons mint in small bowl. Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Spray burgers with nonstick spray; grill until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Cut 1 end off each pita; fill with 1 burger, some lettuce and 1/4 of yogurt mixture.
