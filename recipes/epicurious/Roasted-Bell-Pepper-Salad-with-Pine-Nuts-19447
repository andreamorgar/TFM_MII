Preheat oven to 400°F. Place all bell peppers in large bowl. Pour 6 tablespoons oil over peppers; toss to coat. Place peppers, cut side down, on 2 large rimmed baking sheets. Sprinkle with salt. Roast until peppers are soft and slightly blackened, about 1 hour, reversing sheets after 30 minutes. Cool slightly; peel, if desired. Cut peppers into 1/4-inch-wide strips. Transfer to large bowl; add accumulated juices from baking sheets. Add 3 tablespoons vinegar and remaining 2 tablespoons oil; toss gently. Refrigerate at least 1 hour. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.) Drain peppers; discard juices. Transfer peppers to platter. Season with salt, pepper and more vinegar, if desired. Toss gently; sprinkle with pine nuts.
