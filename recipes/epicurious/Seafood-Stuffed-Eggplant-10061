Preheat broiler. Arrange eggplants on large baking sheet. Pierce with fork. Broil 4 minutes per side. Scoop out eggplant pulp, leaving 1/2-inch-thick shell intact. Place eggplant pulp in heavy medium saucepan. Pour 2 cups water over. Add 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer 15 minutes. Uncover and simmer until eggplant is very tender and liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Preheat oven to 375°F. Brush eggplant shells with 1 tablespoon oil. Bake until shells are tender but still hold shape, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions; sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Add boiled eggplant, shrimp and cayenne; sauté until shrimp are cooked through, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in 1 cup breadcrumbs and crabmeat. Season with salt and pepper. Fill eggplant shells with seafood mixture. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead; refrigerate.) Preheat oven to 375°F. Sprinkle stuffing with remaining 2 tablespoons breadcrumbs. Bake stuffed eggplants until heated through, about 30 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes. Serve hot.
