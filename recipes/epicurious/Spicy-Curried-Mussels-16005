Cook shallots, curry powder, and red pepper flakes in butter in a 5- to 6-quart heavy pot over moderate heat, stirring, until shallots are softened, about 4 minutes. Add Sherry and simmer, stirring, 1 minute. Add mussels and cook, covered, over moderately high heat 4 to 6 minutes, checking periodically after 4 minutes and transferring mussels as opened to a bowl. (Discard any unopened mussels after 6 minutes.) Add cream and water to pot and bring to a boil. Add cilantro and salt to taste, then pour over mussels and toss lightly.
