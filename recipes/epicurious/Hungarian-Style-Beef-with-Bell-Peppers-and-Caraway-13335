Toss beef with paprika, salt, and pepper in large bowl to coat. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add garlic and caraway seeds; stir 30 seconds. Add peppers; toss 1 minute. Add broth. Cover; cook until peppers are crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Using tongs, transfer garlic and peppers to bowl. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and beef to skillet; sauté until beef is no longer pink outside, about 2 minutes. Mix in tomato paste and vinegar. Return half of peppers to skillet. Toss until beef is medium-rare, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to platter; top with remaining bell peppers.
