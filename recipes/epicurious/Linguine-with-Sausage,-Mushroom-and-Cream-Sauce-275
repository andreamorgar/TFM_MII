Sauté sausage in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until brown and cooked through, breaking up large pieces with fork, about 12 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer sausage to plate. Add mushrooms and crushed red pepper to drippings in skillet. Cover and cook until mushrooms are tender, stirring occasionally, about 6 minutes. Add 3/4 cup broth and cream to skillet and set aside. Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain pasta; return to same pot. Add sausage, mushroom mixture and cheese. Toss over medium heat until sauce coats pasta thickly, adding more broth by 1/4 cupfuls if mixture is dry, about 3 minutes. Season pasta to taste with salt and pepper.
