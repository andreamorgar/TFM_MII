Cook half of shrimp in a 5- to 6-quart pot of generously salted (2 tablespoons) boiling water, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer shrimp with a slotted spoon to a platter and return water to a boil. Cook remaining shrimp in same manner (then discard water), transferring to platter. When shrimp are cool enough to handle, peel, then chill, covered, until completely cold, about 1 hour. Whisk together mayonnaise, lemon juice, tarragon, salt, and pepper in a large bowl and chill until ready to use. Devein shrimp and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Season with salt and pepper, then add to dressing along with celery, and toss to combine. Serve salad in rolls.
