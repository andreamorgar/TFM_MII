Preheat oven to 500°F. In a small bowl stir together chili powder, cumin, black pepper, allspice, and sugar and stir in garlic paste and Worcestershire sauce. Evenly rub spice mixture onto top and bottom of each steak. Marinate steaks on a plate, loosely covered and chilled, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day. In middle of oven heat a small flameproof baking pan 5 minutes. Add steaks to pan and roast 20 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to a cutting coard, reserving juices in pan and let stand 5 minutes. While steaks are roasting, in a small saucepan simmer water, Worcestershire sauce, tomato paste, and garlic until garlic is very soft and liquid is reduced to about 1/3 cup, about 20 minutes. Pour garlic mixture into reserved juices in baking pan and deglaze pan over moderate heat, stirring and scraping up any brown bits in pan. Pour deglazed mixture through a fine sieve into a small bowl, pressing and forcing garlic through sieve to mash it, and stir in any beef juices that have accumulated on cutting board. Cut each steak crosswise into 8 slices. Spoon some sauce onto each of 4 plates and top with steak.
