Add potatoes and bring to boil. Transfer half of potato-broth mix to prepared dish. Sprinkle with 3/4 cup cheese. Top with remaining potato-broth mix. Cover with foil and bake 30 minutes. Uncover; sprinkle with remaining 3/4 cup cheese. Continue baking uncovered until potatoes are tender and top browns, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly.
