Heat oven to 350°F. In a medium oven-safe frying pan, heat oil over medium heat. Cook mushrooms and shallots until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. Mix in asparagus, scallion, peas and dill. Pour egg whites on top of mixture; sprinkle on cheese; shake pan to incorporate. Bake until egg whites are set, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve immediately with turkey bacon on the side.
