In large pot of boiling salted water, cook beans until crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain in colander, then immediately transfer to bowl of ice and water to stop cooking. Drain and pat dry. Refrigerate 1 hour, or overnight. One hour prior to serving, in large bowl, combine beans, onions, prosciutto, olive oil, lemon juice, rosemary, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Toss gently and let stand at room temperature for one hour before serving.
