Whisk eggs, salt and pepper in large bowl to blend. Melt butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add eggs. Using wooden spoon, stir until eggs are almost set, about 5 minutes. Gently fold in cheese and salmon and stir just until eggs are set, about 1 minute. Transfer eggs to platter. Sprinkle with chives, if desired, and serve.
