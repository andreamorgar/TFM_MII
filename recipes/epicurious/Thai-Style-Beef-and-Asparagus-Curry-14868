Place beef and curry paste in medium bowl. Stir to coat beef thoroughly. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Cover; chill.) Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large skillet over high heat. Add asparagus and sauté until crisp-tender and beginning to char slightly, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer asparagus to bowl. Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to skillet. Add curry-coated beef in single layer. Cook over high heat without stirring until bottom of beef begins to char slightly, about 2 minutes. Add coconut milk and cook, stirring often, until sauce is bubbling and slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Add asparagus and heat through. Stir in basil. Squeeze lime wedges over mixture and serve.
