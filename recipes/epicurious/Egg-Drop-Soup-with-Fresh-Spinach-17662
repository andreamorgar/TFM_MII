In a medium saucepan over high heat, bring the chicken broth and 2 cups water to a simmer. Add the spinach, scallions, mushrooms, and soy sauce; cook for 1 minute, stirring. Very slowly pour the egg whites into the pot; immediately turn off the heat. Use a fork to stir the egg whites in a clockwise direction to make thin ribbons in the broth. Ladle into 2 bowls and garnish each with a drop of sesame oil. Serve with the crackers.
