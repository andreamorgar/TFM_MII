Sear salt pork in butter until brown. Add beef cubes and brown well on all sides. Add onions, salt, pepper thyme, bay leaf, and garlic. Sprinkle with flour. Add meat stock, parsley, celery, leeks, and carrots, and barely cover with red wine. Cover pot and seal lid with flour and water dough. Cook gently in a 300°F oven for 3 hours. Meanwhile sauté the mushrooms. When meat is done, remove from pot and combine beef and salt pork with mushrooms. Strain broth and skim off fat (you may thicken broth with beurre manié if you wish.) Taste for seasoning and add meat and mushroom mixture. Cook gently on top of stove for about 20 minutes. Serve with rice or boiled or baked potatoes. With this, drink the same wine used for cooking, a California Pinot Noir or Burgundy.
