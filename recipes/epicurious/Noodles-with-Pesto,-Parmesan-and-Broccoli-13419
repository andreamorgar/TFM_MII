Cook noodles in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain noodles, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid. Heat olive oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add onion, garlic and dried red pepper and sauté until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add broccoli and 1/4 cup reserved noodle cooking liquid. Cover pot and cook until broccoli is crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Add noodles, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and pesto. Toss until noodles are evenly coated, adding remaining reserved liquid by tablespoonfuls if mixture is dry. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer mixture to large bowl. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.
