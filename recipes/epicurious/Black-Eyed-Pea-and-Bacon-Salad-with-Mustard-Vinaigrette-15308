Quick-soak black-eyed peas. In a saucepan simmer peas in water to cover until tender, about 20 minutes, and drain in a sieve. In a large bowl whisk together mustard, shallot, garlic, and vinegar and slowly whisk in oil until emulsified. Stir warm peas into vinaigrette. Chop bacon and in a 12-inch skillet cook over moderate heat, stirring, until crisp. With a slotted spoon transfer bacon to paper towels to drain and cool slightly. Quarter tomatoes, discarding seeds, and cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Add bacon and tomatoes to pea mixture. Cut scallions and celery crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Cut enough romaine crosswise into 1/4-inch-wide strips to measure 4 cups and trim arugula. Add scallions, celery, romaine, arugula, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste to pea mixture and gently toss until combined well.
