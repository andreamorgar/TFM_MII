Cut 4 scrubbed large carrots into 3" lengths; place in a steamer basket set in a large saucepan filled with 2" simmering water. Cover and steam until tender, 10–15 minutes; let cool. Cut 4 flat surfaces at 90°F angles lengthwise around each carrot. Heat a dry medium skillet, preferably cast iron, over high and cook carrots, turning, until blackened, 10–12 minutes. Let cool. Cut carrots crosswise into thin slices without cutting all the way through and fan out. Drizzle with olive oil and fresh lemon juice, and sprinkle with flaky sea salt and sliced chives.
