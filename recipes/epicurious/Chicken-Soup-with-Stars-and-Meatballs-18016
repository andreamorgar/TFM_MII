1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 2. Set aside 4 tablespoons of the cheese. 3. Combine the ground meat, onion, bread crumbs, spinach, egg, 3/4 teaspoon of the salt, and the remaining cheese in a medium bowl. Shape into 30 meatballs, each 1 inch in diameter. 4. Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Reduce heat to medium-low; add the meatballs and cook, turning, until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the meatballs to a large saucepan. 5. Meanwhile, add the pasta to the boiling water and cook according to the package directions; drain. 6. Add the chicken stock to the browned meatballs and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until the meatballs are just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Stir in the pasta and salt to taste. 7. Ladle the soup into bowls and sprinkle with the reserved cheese.
