Mince garlic and in a small bowl stir together with mustard, vinegar, and cream. Add oils in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified, and season with pepper and salt. Roast and peel bell pepper . Cut pepper into 1/4-inch dice. Separate lettuce leaves from head, leaving them whole, and discard coarse stems from watercress. Cut mushrooms into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Prepare grill. Halve each quail lengthwise through breast and pat dry. Rub quail lightly all over with oil and season with pepper and salt. Grill quail on a lightly oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until skin is well browned but meat is still pink. (Alternatively, grill quail in a hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat.) In a large bowl toss watercress and mushrooms with just enough vinaigrette to coat lightly. Arrange lettuce on each of 4 large plates and top with watercress mixture and bell pepper. Arrange quail on top of salad and sprinkle with tarragon. Serve remaining vinaigrette on the side.
