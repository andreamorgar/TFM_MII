Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Add sausage and cook until no longer pink, breaking up with fork, about 6 minutes. Stir in pepper flakes. Add wine and boil until absorbed. Mix in crushed tomatoes. Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer 25 minutes. Stir 2 tablespoons marjoram into sauce. Cook penne in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain well. Return penne to pot. Add half of sauce and stir to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to large bowl. Serve, passing Parmesan separately. (Freeze remaining sauce up to 2 months in covered container.)
