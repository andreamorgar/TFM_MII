Preheat oven to 325°F with rack in middle. Slice tangerines (including peel) crosswise about 1/4 inch thick. Remove and discard any seeds, then arrange tangerines in a 13- by 9-inch baking dish, overlapping if necessary. Bring sugar and water to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring occasionally, then simmer 2 minutes. Stir in wine and lemon juice and return to a simmer. Pour over fruit. Lay a sheet of parchment paper directly over fruit to keep submerged, then poach in oven until tender but not falling apart, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Discard parchment and cool fruit to warm or room temperature.
