Place cauliflower in large microwave-safe bowl. Add leeks and 1 cup broth. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Microwave on high until vegetables are very soft, about 14 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer vegetables to processor. Blend until smooth. Mix in cooking broth by tablespoonfuls to thin, if desired. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill. Rewarm, covered, in microwave before serving.)
