Beat butter, sorghum syrup, cinnamon, cloves and cayenne in medium bowl to blend; season with salt. (Can be prepared 5 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring mixture to room temperature before using.) Preheat oven to 350°F. Rinse potatoes; pat dry. Pierce each several times with fork; place on baking sheet. Bake potatoes until tender, about 1 hour. Cut top of each potato lengthwise; press in ends to open top. Spoon some sorghum butter into opening of each potato and serve. *Sorghum syrup (a juice extracted from cereal grass) is available at some natural foods stores or by mail order; call Brownville Mills at 800-305-7990
