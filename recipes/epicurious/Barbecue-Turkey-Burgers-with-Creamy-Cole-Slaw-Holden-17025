In a small bowl stir together Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, soy sauce, garlic paste, chili powder, cumin, Tabasco, and salt and pepper to taste until sauce is smooth. In a large bowl stir together turkey, onion, bread crumbs, and 1/4 cup sauce until combined well and form into six 3/4-inch-thick patties. Burgers may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Divide remaining sauce in half and put in separate bowls, half for brushing burgers on the grill and half for drizzling on cooked burgers. Chill sauce, covered. In a large bowl whisk together mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, and mustard. Add remaining cole slaw ingredients and salt and pepper to taste and toss to combine well. Cole slaw may be made 4 hours ahead and chilled, covered. Prepare grill. Grill burgers on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals, brushing frequently with barbecue sauce, 6 minutes on each side, or until cooked through. Drizzle burgers with remaining barbecue sauce and serve with cole slaw in pita pockets.
