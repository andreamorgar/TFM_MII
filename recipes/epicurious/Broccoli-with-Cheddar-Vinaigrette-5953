In a blender blend together the oil, the vinegar, the water, the Tabasco, the Cheddar, and salt and pepper to taste until the vinaigrette is smooth. In a small saucepan bring 1 inch of water to a boil and in it cook the broccoli, covered, over high heat for 4 to 5 minutes, or until it is crisp-tender. Drain the broccoli well and serve it topped with the vinaigrette.
