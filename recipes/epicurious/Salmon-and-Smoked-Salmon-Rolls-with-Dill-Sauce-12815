Sprinkle salmon with salt and pepper. Steam until just opaque in center, about 15 minutes. Cool completely. Line baking sheet with paper towels. Slice enough 1/8-inch-thick lengthwise strips from center portion of each zucchini to make 24. Steam in batches until just tender but very pliable, about 3 minutes. Transfer to prepared baking sheet; pat dry. Whisk mayonnaise, 3/4 cup dill and vinegar in small bowl. Season dill sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Flake salmon coarsely into large bowl, discarding skin and bones. Gently mix in smoked salmon, pickle, remaining 3 tablespoons dill and 1/4 cup dill sauce. Place 1 rounded tablespoon salmon mixture at end of each zucchini strip. Roll up strips, enclosing salmon. Place rolls seam side down on platter. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Place rolls on paper towels. Cover rolls and sauce separately; chill.) Serve rolls with remaining dill sauce.
