With a cleaver or heavy chef's knife cut chicken into large pieces. Cut chicken through bones into 2-inch pieces. In a large kettle of boiling water blanch chicken 1 minute. In a colander drain chicken and rinse under cold water. With flat side of cleaver or knife lightly smash gingerroot and scallions. In cleaned kettle bring 10 cups water to a boil with chicken, gingerroot, scallions, rice wine or Sherry and simmer, uncovered, skimming froth occasionally, 2 hours. Pour broth through colander lined with triple thickness of cheesecloth into a large heatproof bowl, reserving chicken for another use. Broth may be made 3 days ahead, cooled completely, uncovered, and chilled, covered. In cleaned kettle bring broth to a boil. Add noodles and boil, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes. Stir in spinach and simmer, stirring once or twice, until spinach turns bright green and is just tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in chives and salt and pepper to taste and simmer 1 minute.
