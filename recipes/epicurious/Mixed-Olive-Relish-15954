Working with several brine-cured olives at a time and using flat side of a large heavy knife, press olives to crush them and remove pits. Coarsely chop all olives and in a bowl toss with onion, oil, lemon juice, and capers. Relish may be prepared up to this point 2 days ahead and chilled, covered. Bring relish to room temperature before serving. Stir in parsley.
