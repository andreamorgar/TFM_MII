Preheat oven to 375°F. In a 2-quart saucepan three fourths full with boiling water boil barley, partially covered, until tender, about 30 minutes. While barley is cooking, in a baking pan toast walnuts in middle of oven until golden, about 7 minutes. Chop parsley. Cut celery and radicchio into 1/4-inch dice. Peel and core pear and cut into 1/4-inch dice. Drain barley in a sieve and transfer to a bowl. Add feta to barley and add nuts, parsley, celery, radicchio, pear, lemon juice, oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Toss salad until combined.
