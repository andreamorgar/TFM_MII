In a small saucepan simmer the figs and the zest in the water, covered partially, for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the figs are tender and most of the water is evaporated. Transfer the fig mixture to a bowl and let it cool. Stir in the orange, the honey, the shallot, the rosemary, and the lemon juice, let the mixture stand for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 days, and stir in the pine nuts. Serve the relish with duck, chicken, or pork.
