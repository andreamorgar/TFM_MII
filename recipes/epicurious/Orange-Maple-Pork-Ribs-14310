Remove ribs from marinade and season with salt and pepper. Grill until cooked through, turning occasionally, approximately 25 minutes. Meanwhile, place marinade in heavy small saucepan. Add maple syrup and boil until reduced to 1/4 cup, about 18 minutes. Brush ribs with glaze. Grill ribs 1 minute longer and serve.
