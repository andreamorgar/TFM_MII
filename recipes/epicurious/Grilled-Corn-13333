Prepare grill for cooking. If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill. Pull husks back from corn, keeping them attached at base, and discard silk. Push husks back around ears and soak in cold water 10 minutes. When fire is hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 1 to 2 seconds) drain corn and grill (in husks) on lightly oiled grill rack, uncovered, turning, 10 minutes. Pull back husks and grill corn, turning, until browned and tender, about 5 minutes more. Brush corn with butter and season with salt.
