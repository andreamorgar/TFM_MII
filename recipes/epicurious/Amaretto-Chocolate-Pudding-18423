Pour dry chocolate pudding mix into heavy saucepan. Add chopped semisweet chocolate. Gradually mix in milk and 6 tablespoons amaretto liqueur. Stir pudding over medium heat until chocolate melts and pudding comes to boil and thickens. Divide pudding equally among four 3/4-cup ramekins or custard cups. Refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.) Whip cream, sugar and remaining 1 tablespoon amaretto liqueur in small bowl until stiff peaks form. Top chilled pudding with large dollop of whipped cream, then with raspberries and chocolate curls, if desired.
