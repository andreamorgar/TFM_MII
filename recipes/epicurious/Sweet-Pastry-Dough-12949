Cut butter into 1/2-inch cubes. In a bowl with your fingertips or a pastry blender blend together flour, sugar, salt, and butter until most of mixture resembles coarse meal with remainder in small (roughly pea-size) lumps. In a small bowl or cup stir together yolk and ice water. Drizzle yolk mixture over flour mixture, stirring gently with a fork until incorporated, and gently form mixture into a ball. Turn mixture out onto a floured work surface and divide into 4 portions. With heel of hand smear each portion once in a forward motion to help distribute fat. Gather dough together and form it, rotating on work surface, into a disk. Chill dough, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, at least 1 hour, and up to 1 day.
