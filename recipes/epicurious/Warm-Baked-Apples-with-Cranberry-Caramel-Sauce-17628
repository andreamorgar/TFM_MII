Preheat oven to 350°F. Using small end of melon baller, scoop out stem end and core of each apple, leaving bottom intact. Using vegetable peeler, remove peel from top third of each. Stand apples in 11 x 7-inch glass baking dish, trimming apple bottoms if necessary to create flat surface. Bring 3/4 cup cream, cranberry juice concentrate, sugar, and butter to boil in heavy medium saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves. Pour syrup over apples, adding some to hollow centers. Bake apples until tender, basting once, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, beat remaining 1/2 cup cream in medium bowl until peaks form. Chill whipped cream in bowl. Transfer each apple to shallow bowl, emptying any juices from center into baking dish. Pour syrup from dish into medium saucepan. Boil syrup until thick enough to coat spoon, 2 to 3 minutes. Spoon over warm apples. Top each baked apple with whipped cream.
