Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add shallots and sauté 3 minutes. Add rice and 2 tablespoons pistachios; stir 2 minutes. Stir in 1 can broth, lemon juice, and salt; bring to boil. Reduce heat to low; cover and cook until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Mix in 4 tablespoons pistachios and 2 tablespoons lemon peel. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Spread rice out onto baking sheet; cool. Before continuing, drizzle with more broth and rewarm tightly covered with foil in 400°F oven until heated through, about 10 minutes.) Transfer rice to bowl. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons pistachios and 1/2 tablespoon lemon peel.
