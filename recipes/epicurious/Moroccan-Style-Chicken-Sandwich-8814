Place currants in a small bowl. Pour hot water over to cover by 1". Set aside. Whisk coriander, cardamom, and cinnamon in another small bowl for spice mix. Drain any juices from chicken into a measuring cup. Add enough chicken stock to cup to measure 3/4 cup. Pour into a large bowl. Coarsely shred chicken (discard skin and bones); add to bowl with juices. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons spice mix over; toss to coat. Combine tomatoes, olives, almonds, 1/2 cup oil, and vinegar in a medium bowl. Drain currants; add to tomato relish. Season relish to taste with salt. Add half of relish to chicken mixture. Set remaining relish aside. Whisk yogurt and harissa in another small bowl to blend. Season to taste with salt and more harissa, if desired. Preheat broiler. Brush flatbreads with oil. Broil until charred in spots, watching closely to prevent burning, 1-2 minutes per side. Arrange chicken mixture, relish, harissa yogurt, and bread on table so your guests can assemble sandwiches.
