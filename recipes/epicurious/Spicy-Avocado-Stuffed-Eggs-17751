In medium saucepan, combine eggs (in single layer) and cold water to cover. Bring to boil, turn off heat, cover pan, and let stand 18 minutes. Drain, add cold water to cover eggs, drain again, add several ice cubes to pan, and again add cold water to cover. Let stand until eggs are cold, about 3 minutes. Peel eggs and halve lengthwise. Carefully remove yolks and mash in large bowl with fork. Add mayonnaise, lime juice, wasabi paste, salt, and pepper and stir with fork until smooth. Fold in tomato, scallion, and chile. Fold in avocado. Spoon mixture into whites.
