Melt 1/4 cup butter in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add half of mushrooms and sauté until brown and beginning to release juices, about 10 minutes. Add 1/2 cup wine, 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg. Boil until slightly reduced, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add 1 cup cream and boil until sauce thickens and coats mushrooms, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl. Repeat cooking procedure with remaining butter, mushrooms, wine, lemon juice, nutmeg and cream. Transfer to bowl with first batch. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm over low heat before continuing.) Transfer mushrooms to bowl. Garnish with parsley and serve.
