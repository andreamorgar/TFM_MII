Whisk together buttermilk, mayonnaise, chives, vinegar, salt, and pepper in a small bowl until smooth. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Reduce heat to moderate and fry ham, 2 slices at a time, turning over once, until golden brown and crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer with tongs to paper towels to drain and cool slightly. Stack fried ham and chop into roughly 1- to 2-inch pieces. Halve pears lengthwise and core, then cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Combine chicory, ham, and pear slices in a large bowl. Drizzle with dressing and toss to coat.
