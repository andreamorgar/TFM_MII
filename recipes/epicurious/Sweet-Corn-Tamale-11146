Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray 8x8x2-inch glass baking dish with nonstick vegetable oil spray. Whisk first 4 ingredients to blend in large bowl. Mix in cottage cheese, then corn and green onions. Beat whites until stiff but not dry in another large bowl. Fold whites into cornmeal mixture in 2 additions. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake until top is golden and feels firm in center, approximately 50 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes. Boil stewed tomatoes in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat until reduced to sauce consistency, approximately 10 minutes. Cut "pie" into squares. Spoon tomato sauce over and serve.
