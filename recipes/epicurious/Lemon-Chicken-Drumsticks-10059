1. Rinse the chicken and pat dry. 2. Combine the lemon zest and juice, thyme, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add the drumsticks and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours, or overnight. 3. Preheat the oven to 375°F. 4. Arrange the drumsticks in a shallow roasting dish to fit (use two dishes to avoid crowding). Pour any marinade over the chicken and bake, basting occasionally, until the drumsticks are cooked through and golden brown, about 1 1/4 hours. 5. If the drumsticks have not browned enough, place them under the broiler, 4 inches from the heat source, for 2 to 3 minutes on each side or until browned, watching carefully. 6. Spoon the orzo or rice on a platter and arrange the drumsticks on top. Pour the chicken pan juices into a small saucepan and cook over medium-high heat until thickened. Pour over the chicken and sprinkle with parsley. Serve immediately.
