Preheat broiler. Line small baking sheet with foil; brush foil with 1 tablespoon oil. Cut each fennel bulb vertically into 8 wedges, keeping part of core attached to each wedge. Place fennel, cut side down, on prepared sheet. Brush fennel all over with 1 1/2 tablespoons oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Broil fennel until just tender and beginning to brown, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes. Arrange fennel on large serving platter. Set baking sheet aside. Place bell pepper strips in medium bowl. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil to the peppers and toss to coat. Arrange peppers on reserved baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Broil until peppers are charred in spots and just tender, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes. Arrange peppers among fennel wedges on platter. Whisk remaining 2 tablespoons oil and lemon juice in small bowl to blend. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper. Drizzle dressing over broiled vegetables. Garnish salad with some reserved fennel fronds. Serve salad warm or at room temperature.
