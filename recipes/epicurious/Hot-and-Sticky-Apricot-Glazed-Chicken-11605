Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Combine first 4 ingredients in small saucepan. Whisk over medium heat until preserves melt. Set glaze aside. Sprinkle chicken generously on all sides with salt and pepper. Place chicken, skin side down, on outer edges of grill rack. Cover grill and cook chicken until skin is light golden, turning occasionally, about 15 minutes total. Continue to grill, brushing with glaze and turning occasionally, until skin is blackened in spots and juices run clear when thighs are pierced with fork, about 10 minutes longer. Divide among 4 plates and serve.
