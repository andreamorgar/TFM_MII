Prick kumquats 2 or 3 times with a sharp fork. Cover kumquats generously with cold water in a heavy medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Drain and rinse with cold water, then repeat 2 more times (to remove bitterness). Bring kumquats, sugar, and water (3/4 cup) to a boil in rinsed saucepan (liquid will not cover kumquats) over high heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved, then reduce heat and gently simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes. Remove from heat and cool kumquats in syrup, about 20 minutes. Transfer kumquats with a slotted spoon to a bowl, reserving syrup in saucepan. Add cranberries and 1/4 teaspoon salt to syrup and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until berries burst, 8 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat. While cranberries cook, quarter kumquats lengthwise, discarding any seeds. Stir kumquats into cranberry mixture and transfer to a bowl. Cool completely, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.
