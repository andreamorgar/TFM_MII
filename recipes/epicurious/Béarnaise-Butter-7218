Place shallots, vinegar, half of tarragon, and half of parsley in small saucepan. Simmer over medium-high heat until vinegar is reduced to 3 tablespoons, about 3 minutes. Strain into small bowl, pressing on solids to release any liquid. Discard solids; cool tarragon vinegar. Mix butter, lemon peel, and remaining chopped tarragon and parsley in medium bowl to blend. Mix in cooled tarragon vinegar. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before using.)
