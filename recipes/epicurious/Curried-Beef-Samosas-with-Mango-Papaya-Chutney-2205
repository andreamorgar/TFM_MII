Combine all ingredients except currants in medium saucepan. Simmer until onion is tender and mixture thickens slightly, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Stir in currants. Cool. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Chill.) Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add beef and sauté until brown, breaking up clumps with back of spoon, about 5 minutes. Add curry powder and flour and sauté 2 minutes longer. Transfer beef mixture to colander and drain oil. Cool. Lightly flour baking sheet. Arrange 12 wonton wrappers on work surface. Spoon scant 1 tablespoon filling in center of each. Brush edges with egg. Fold each wrapper diagonally in half, forming triangle. Press edges together to seal. Transfer to prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Cover; chill.) Add enough vegetable oil to heavy large saucepan to reach depth of 4 inches. Heat to 350°F. Working in batches, fry samosas until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer samosas to paper towels. Serve samosas with chutney.
