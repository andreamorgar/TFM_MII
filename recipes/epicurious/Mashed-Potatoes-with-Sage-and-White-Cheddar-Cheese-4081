Butter 8- to 10-cup baking dish. Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 12 minutes. Meanwhile, melt butter in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons sage; stir until butter begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Add cream and milk; bring to simmer. Drain potatoes; return to pot. Stir over medium heat until excess moisture evaporates. Add cream mixture; mash potatoes. Stir in 1 3/4 cups cheese. Season potatoes with salt and pepper. Transfer to prepared dish. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup cheese and 1 teaspoon sage. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover with plastic; chill.) Preheat oven to 375°F. Bake potatoes uncovered until heated through and golden brown, about 45 minutes.
