Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Cook the noodles until tender yet firm, about 2 minutes for fresh Chinese noodles, 10 seconds for fresh ramen, and 3 minutes for dried ramen. Drain the noodles and shock in ice-cold water. Drain again. In a large bowl whisk together the vinegar, sesame paste, soy sauce, honey, sesame oil, and chili-garlic sauce until smooth. Add the noodles and toss well to distribute the sauce evenly throughout. Garnish with the scallions and cilantro and serve at room temperature or slightly chilled.
