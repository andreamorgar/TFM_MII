Slice zucchini very thinly with slicer. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then fry zucchini in 3 batches, stirring occasionally, until softened and very pale golden, 3 to 4 minutes per batch. Transfer as fried with a slotted spoon to a baking pan lined with paper towels to drain. Keep zucchini warm, covered with foil. Add garlic to oil in skillet and cook over moderately high heat, stirring, until very pale golden, about 30 seconds. Remove skillet from heat. Cook pasta in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water , uncovered, until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta-cooking water. Drain pasta in a colander and transfer to a large shallow bowl. Toss pasta with garlic oil, zucchini, mint, zest, salt, and pepper. Add some of reserved cooking water to moisten if necessary.
