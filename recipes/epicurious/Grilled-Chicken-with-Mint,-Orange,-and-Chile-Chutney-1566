Prepare grill for cooking. Pat chicken dry, then brush with oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill on a rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals until just cooked through, about 4 minutes on each side. Transfer to a cutting board and let stand, covered, 5 minutes. Dip each chicken breast into chutney to coat and serve with remaining chutney.
