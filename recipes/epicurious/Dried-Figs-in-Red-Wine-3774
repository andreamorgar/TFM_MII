Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Put figs in a 3-quart shallow glass or ceramic baking dish. Bring wine with sugar and zests to a boil in a 1-quart heavy saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then pour over figs (figs will not be covered by liquid). Bake figs, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until figs have absorbed about two thirds of liquid and are very tender but still hold their shape, 50 to 60 minutes. Put a sheet of parchment directly on figs, pressing them into liquid, then let stand at room temperature 1 hour. Serve figs with a bit of their juices and small scoops of ice cream, all drizzled with Sherry vinegar syrup. Figs can be made 1 week ahead and chilled, covered. Bring to room temperature before serving.
