Stir 1/4 cup water, sugar and mint in medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves and syrup comes to simmer. Remove from heat. Cover and let steep 5 minutes. Add thawed blackberries with juices, reserved blackberry puree from Frozen Blackberry-Cream Pops, and cassis. Transfer mixture to blender and puree until smooth. Strain sauce into medium bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids in strainer. Chill until cold. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.)
