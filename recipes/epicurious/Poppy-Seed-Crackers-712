Preheat oven to 350°F. Stir together egg, water, and salt. Brush each tortilla on 1 side with egg wash, then, holding over a bowl, sprinkle with poppy seeds to cover completely. Cut out 7 or 8 stars from each coated tortilla (you’ll have to press hard; use a pot holder to protect your hands), transferring to 2 baking sheets, seeded sides up. Bake, 1 sheet at a time, in middle of oven until crisp, about 15 minutes. Cool crackers on a rack.
