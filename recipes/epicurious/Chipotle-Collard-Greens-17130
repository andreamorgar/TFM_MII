Add the onion; sauté about 5 minutes or until golden. Reduce heat to medium. Add the garlic; sauté for 5 minutes more. 3. Add the water and collard greens to the pot; season with hot sauce and salt. Cook, uncovered, for 25 minutes, tossing the greens occasionally. Taste and adjust seasonings, if necessary.
