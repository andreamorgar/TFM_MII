Combine 1/2 cup plain whole-milk yogurt, 1/4 cup vinegar-based hot sauce (such as Crystal), 4 finely chopped garlic cloves, 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh oregano, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon garam masala in a large resealable plastic bag. Add 1 Dai Due's Master Brined Chicken, backbone removed, and turn to coat. Seal bag, pressing out air; chill chicken 8–24 hours. Prepare grill for medium heat; lightly brush grate with vegetable oil. Remove chicken from marinade, wiping off any excess, and grill, skin side down, until skin is lightly charred and releases from grate without tearing, 10–15 minutes. Give bird a quarter turn and continue to grill until skin is nicely charred and crisp and thighs are starting to firm up (they should be springy when pressed), 15–20 minutes. Turn chicken over and grill until an instantread thermometer inserted into the thickest part of thigh registers 165°F, 10–15 minutes. Place chicken on a platter skin side up; let rest 10 minutes before carving.
