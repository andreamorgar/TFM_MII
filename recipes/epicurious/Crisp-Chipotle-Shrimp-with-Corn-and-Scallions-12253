Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 475°F. Stir together mayonnaise, chipotle with adobo sauce, and salt in a bowl. Pulse 1 1/2 cups corn in a food processor with water and 2 tablespoons chipotle mayonnaise until coarsely puréed. Transfer mixture to a shallow 2-quart gratin dish. Stir in scallions and remaining corn. Toss shrimp with remaining chipotle mayonnaise in bowl to coat. Put 1 cup panko in another bowl, then add shrimp in small batches, tossing to coat evenly and shaking off excess (add more panko if needed). Arrange shrimp in 1 layer on top of corn. Roast until crumbs are golden and shrimp are just cooked through, about 18 minutes.
