Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Arrange zucchini, bell pepper and tomato on rimmed baking sheet. Whisk dressing and chopped basil in medium bowl to blend. Brush cut side of each roll with 1/2 tablespoon dressing mixture. Brush vegetables with remaining dressing mixture and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill cut side of rolls until toasted, about 1 minute. Place rolls, cut side up, on plates. Grill vegetables until tender and lightly charred, turning and brushing occasionally with any dressing mixture left on baking sheet, about 10 minutes. Arrange warm vegetables on roll bottoms. Cover each with 2 slices cheese, 4 whole basil leaves and top of roll.
