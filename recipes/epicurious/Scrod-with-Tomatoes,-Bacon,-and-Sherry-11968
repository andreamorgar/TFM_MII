In a skillet cook the bacon over moderate heat, turning it, until it is crisp, transfer it with tongs to paper towels to drain, and crumble it. Pour all but 1 tablespoon of the fat from the skillet and in the remaining fat cook the onion, stirring, until it begins to turn golden. Add the tomatoes, the Sherry, the soy sauce, and the sugar and simmer the sauce for 5 minutes, or until it is thickened. Add the scrod and simmer it, covered, for 4 minutes. Turn the scrod and simmer it, covered, for 4 minutes more, or until it just flakes. Transfer the scod with a slotted spatula to 2 plates and keep warm, covered. (If desired, boil the sauce for 1 minute to thicken it slightly.) Spoon the sauce over the scrod and sprinkle the scrod with the bacon.
