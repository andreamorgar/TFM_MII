In a food processor fitted with the steel blade purée the scallops with the pimiento, the egg white, the salt, and the pepper, transfer the purée to a bowl, and chill it, covered, for 1 hour. Flatten the sole fillets skinned side down between sheets of wax paper until they are about 1/8 inch thick and cut each fillet crosswise into 3 sections. Spread 1 heaping tablespoon of the purée on each section, roll up each section beginning with a cut side, and wrap it securely in Saran Wrap. In a kettle steam the rolls on a rack set over boiling water, covered, for 4 minutes, transfer them with tongs to a dish, and chill them, covered, for at least 2 hours or overnight. Peel off the plastic wrap, trim the ends, and cut the rolls crosswise into 1-inch pieces. Turn the spirals cut side up and arrange them decoratively on a platter.
