Preheat oven to 450° F. Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper and arrange, skin sides up, in an 18- by 11 1/2-inch roasting pan. Drizzle chicken with oil and roast 20 minutes. Scatter peaches, onions, jalapeños, garlic, and lemon over and around chicken. Reduce temperature to 375° F. and roast chicken, covered with foil, 30 minutes more. Remove foil and roast chicken, basting occasionally with pan juices, until peaches and onions are soft, about 30 minutes more. Transfer chicken mixture to a platter, spooning any pan juices over it. Serve chicken with rice.
