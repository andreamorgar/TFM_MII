Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Cut butter into bits and, with your fingertips or a pastry blender, blend into flour mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Using a fork, stir raisins and milk until just combined. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and, with floured hands, knead until it forms a dough. Roll out dough into a 9-inch round (about 1/2 inch thick) and cut out scones with a 2 1/2-inch round cutter. Arrange scones 1 inch apart on a buttered large baking sheet and gently reroll and cut out scraps. Bake scones in middle of a 425°F oven until pale golden, about 15 minutes, and transfer to a rack to cool.
