In a bowl with an electric mixer cream together the butter and 1 cup of the sugar and beat in the egg, the zest, and the almonds. Beat in the flour, a little at a time, beat the dough until it is combined well, and chill it, covered for 2 hours. Form the dough into walnut-size balls and arrange them 2 inches apart on lightly greased baking sheets. Dip the bottom of a glass, moistened, in the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and with it press down on the cookies, flattening them to about 2 inches in diameter. Bake the cookies in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are golden around the edges, transfer them to racks, and let them cool.
