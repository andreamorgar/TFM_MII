Toss cabbage, 1 cup cilantro, and lime juice in medium bowl. Season salad to taste with salt and pepper. Coarsely chop pumpkin seeds in processor (pieces will vary in size). Add remaining 1/2 cup cilantro and process 10 seconds. Turn mixture out onto plate; mix in chili powder. Brush flesh side of each trout with egg, coating generously. Sprinkle trout with salt and pepper. Sprinkle half of pumpkin seed mixture over flesh side of each trout; press firmly to adhere. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in each of 2 large nonstick skillets over medium-high heat. Add 1 trout to each skillet, skin side down. Cook 2 minutes. Turn trout over and cook until browned on bottom and opaque in center, about 2 minutes. Transfer trout to plates; top with cabbage salad.
