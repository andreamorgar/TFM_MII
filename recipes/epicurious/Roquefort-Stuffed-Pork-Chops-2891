Preheat oven to 350°F. Cut each pork chop horizontally in half to bone (or almost through if using boneless chops), making pocket for stuffing. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Add bread and sauté until golden, about 10 minutes. Transfer to medium bowl. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in same skillet. Add mushrooms, onion and rosemary and sauté until onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Add to bread. Refrigerate until mixture is completely cool, about 15 minutes. Mix Roquefort into bread mixture; season with salt and pepper. Insert stuffing into pockets in pork, dividing equally. Skewer pockets closed with toothpicks if necessary. Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper. Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large ovenproof skillet over high heat. Add pork to skillet; sauté until brown, about 2 minutes per side. Place skillet in oven. Bake pork until cooked through, about 25 minutes.
