Preheat the oven to 375ºF. Grease a 9x9-inch baking pan with coconut oil. In a high-speed blender, combine the plantain, 2 of the eggs, and a pinch of salt and blend until smooth. Pour this mixture into the baking pan and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (or lift up the sides to check for doneness). Poach 1 or 2 eggs (depending on how many you are serving). Serve the plantain flatbread topped with the poached egg(s). Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste, and a drizzle of honey. Garnish as desired.
