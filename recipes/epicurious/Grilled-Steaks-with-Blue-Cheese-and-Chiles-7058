Combine olive oil, 2 teaspoons parsley, and garlic in 8x8x2-inch glass dish. Sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper. Add steaks to dish and turn to coat. Marinate steaks 30 minutes or cover and chill up to 1 day. Mix cream cheese, blue cheese, chiles, shallot, vinegar, and remaining 1 teaspoon parsley in medium bowl. Season blue cheese topping to taste with salt and pepper. Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Place steaks on grill rack (some marinade should still cling to meat). Cook 5 minutes. Turn steaks over. Divide blue cheese topping among steaks. Grill until topping softens and steaks are medium-rare, about 5 minutes longer.
