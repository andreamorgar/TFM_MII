Trim zucchini or squash and halve lengthwise. Finely chop scallions. In a 10-inch heavy skillet heat butter and oil over moderately high heat until foam subsides and sauté zucchini or squash and scallions with zest, pepper, and salt to taste, stirring, 2 minutes. Add vermouth and simmer, covered, until zucchini or squash is crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Stir in herbs.
