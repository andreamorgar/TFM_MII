Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Whisk oil, lemon juice and rosemary in small bowl to blend. Season dressing with salt and pepper. Thread tuna, onion and lemon slices onto 4 metal skewers. Brush with dressing; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill tuna and onion until tuna is just opaque in center and onion is slightly charred and tender, turning and brushing often with some remaining dressing, about 8 minutes. Toss greens and all remaining dressing in medium bowl. Mound salad on plates; top with skewers.
