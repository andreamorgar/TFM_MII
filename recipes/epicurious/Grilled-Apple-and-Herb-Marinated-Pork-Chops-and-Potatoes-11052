Arrange the pork chops in one layer in a large shallow dish. In a kettle combine the potatoes with enough water to cover them by 1 inch, simmer them for 10 minutes, or until they are just tender, and drain them. In a blender blend together well the apple juice concentrate, the jelly, the oil, the vinegar, the Worcestershire sauce, the mustard, the rosemary, the sage, the salt and the pepper. Halve the potatoes and in a bowl toss them gently with 1/4 cup of the apple and herb marinade. Pour the remaining marinade over the chops, coating them thoroughly, and let the chops and the potatoes marinate separately, covered and chilled, overnight. Grill the chops, the marinade discarded, on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals for 7 to 8 minutes on each side, or until they are just cooked through. Grill the potatoes, cut sides down, for 10 minutes, or until they are golden brown.
