In a blender blend milk, eggs, flour, and salt until just smooth. Transfer batter to a bowl. Finely chop enough chives to measure 1/2 cup and whisk into batter. Chill batter, covered, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day. Preheat oven to 400°F. Trim fat from bacon. In a large nonstick skillet cook fat over low heat, stirring occasionally, until most of fat is rendered and solids are golden brown. Discard solids and increase heat to moderately high. Heat rendered fat until hot but not smoking and sauté bacon in batches until just golden, about 1 minute on each side. Transfer bacon as cooked to paper towels to drain. Pour rendered fat into a measuring cup and add enough oil to measure 1/2 cup total. In a 12- by 2-inch enameled cast-iron casserole (3 1/2-quart) or a 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish heat oil mixture in middle of oven 5 minutes. Quickly arrange bacon evenly in casserole or baking dish and pour batter over it. Bake pudding in middle of oven until puffed and golden brown, about 50 minutes.
