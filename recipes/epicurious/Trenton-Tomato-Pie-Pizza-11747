Place a rack in lowest position of oven. Set pizza stone or 2 stacked, inverted baking sheets on rack; preheat oven to 500°F at least 1 hour. Drain tomatoes in a colander. Crush into small pieces with your hands, drain again, and transfer to a medium bowl. Stir in salt; set aside. Roll out dough to a 14" circle on lightly floured parchment paper, making sure dough is evenly thin from center to edge; if dough pulls back when rolling, cover with plastic wrap and wait 5 minutes. Transfer parchment with dough to a pizza peel, large cutting board, or inverted baking sheet. Sprinkle with 1 1/4 cups cheese. Top with tomatoes. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese. Carefully slide parchment with pizza onto hot baking stone. Bake pizza until crust is deep golden brown, 10–12 minutes. Transfer pizza to a cutting board and let cool 2 minutes. Drizzle with oil and cut into wedges. Serve with red pepper flakes, if using.
