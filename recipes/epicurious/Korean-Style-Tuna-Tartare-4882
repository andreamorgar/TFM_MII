Cut the carrot and spring onions into a fine julienne and soak in ice water for half an hour. Place the tuna on a chopping board, and remove the skin. Cut it into rounds of 0.5 cm (1/4-inch) thickness, then cut it lengthwise into strips of about 0.5 cm (1/4-inch) square. Place the tuna, carrots, spring onions, cabbage, coriander, pine nuts and dressing in a bowl. Toss to dress and divide between 4 plates. Make a little well in the centre of each, and place an egg yolk on top. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and grind over some pepper. Serve immediately.
