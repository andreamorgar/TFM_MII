Preheat oven to 450°F. Trim beets, leaving about 1 inch of stems attached (reserve greens for another use). Separately wrap golden and long beets tightly in foil and in a baking pan roast in middle of oven until tender, about 1 hour. Unwrap beets carefully. When beets are cool enough to handle, slip off skins and stems. Beets may be roasted 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Separately quarter beets and put into 2 small bowls. Cut endives crosswise into 1/2-inch-wide slices. Trim coarse stems from watercress and tear watercress into bite-size pieces. In a large bowl combine endive and watercress. In a bowl whisk together oil, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. Crumble Roquefort over salad greens and toss well with about 3 tablespoons dressing and salt and pepper to taste. Divide remaining dressing between beets and toss well. Serve salad greens topped with beets.
