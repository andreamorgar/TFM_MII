Blend flour, sugar, grated lemon peel and salt in processor. Add butter; cut in using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal. Mix in enough water to form dough. Turn dough out onto work surface. Gather dough into ball and flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic; refrigerate 1 hour. Preheat oven to 400°F. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 13-inch round. Transfer dough to 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Trim dough overhang to 1/2 inch. Fold overhang under, pressing to form double-thick sides. Freeze crust 15 minutes. Bake crust until pale golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool. Whisk eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, cream, lemon juice, peel and salt in bowl to blend. Pour filling into crust (filling will not fill crust). Bake until set, about 25 minutes. Cool completely. Preheat broiler. Sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon sugar over tart. Cover sides of crust with foil to protect from heat. Broil l tart until sugar caramelizes in spots, watching closely, about 3 minutes. Serve tart warm or at room temperature.
