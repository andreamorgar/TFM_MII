Season chicken with salt and pepper to taste. On a plate combine mustard seeds and parsley and press chicken into seed mixture, coating both sides. In a small saucepan bring 3/4 cup water and salt to a boil. Stir in couscous and let stand, covered, off heat 5 minutes. In a non-stick skillet heat butter over moderate heat until foam subsides and cook chicken on 1 side until golden, about 5 minutes. Turn chicken and cook, covered, over moderately low heat until just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork and divide between 2 plates. Top couscous with chicken. To skillet add lemon juice and remaining tablespoon water and simmer, scraping up brown bits, 1 minute. Pour sauce over chicken and serve with carrot, snow pea, and red pepper julienne.
