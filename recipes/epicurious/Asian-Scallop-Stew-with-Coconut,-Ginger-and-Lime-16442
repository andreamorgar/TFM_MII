Combine scallops, coconut milk, red bell pepper and ginger in heavy medium saucepan. Bring just to boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until scallops are just opaque in center, about 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat. Mix in lime juice, fish sauce and green onions. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls and serve.
