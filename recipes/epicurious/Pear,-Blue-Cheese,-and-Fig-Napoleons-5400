Cut each pear lengthwise into 10 (1/8- to 1/4-inch-thick) slices (5 from one side, then 5 more from the opposite side), avoiding core and discarding rounded outermost slices. Layer 4 pear slices with cheese and fig on each of 4 plates, beginning with largest pear slices, and ending with smallest. Sprinkle any remaining cheese and fig around napoleons.
