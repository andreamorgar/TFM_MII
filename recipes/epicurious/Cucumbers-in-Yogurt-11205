If using a regular supermarket brand of yogurt (not Greek), drain in a paper-towel-lined sieve set over a bowl 1 hour. Discard liquid. While yogurt drains, cut cucumber into 1/2-inch cubes. Transfer to another sieve set over a bowl and toss with 1 teaspoon kosher salt, then drain 1 hour. Rinse cucumber and pat dry. Mince and mash garlic to a paste with remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt using a large heavy knife. Stir together yogurt, cucumbers, garlic paste, and salt to taste in a bowl.
