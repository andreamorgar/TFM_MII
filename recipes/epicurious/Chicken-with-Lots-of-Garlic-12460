Add wine and boil 1 minute. Add broth, then cover skillet and simmer until garlic is tender, about 15 minutes. Return chicken, skin side up, to skillet and simmer, covered, until just cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer chicken to a platter. Mash 8 garlic cloves into sauce and season with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Sprinkle with parsley. Spoon sauce and garlic over chicken.
