1. Place the soy sauce and sugar in a saucepan and cook over low heat until slightly caramelized and thickened, about 5 minutes. 2. Remove from the heat and stir in the garlic. Cool and serve. This sauce will keep well, refrigerated, for a couple of days; bring to room temperature if you're using it as a dipping sauce. (If you're cooking with it, you can use it directly from the refrigerator, of course.)
