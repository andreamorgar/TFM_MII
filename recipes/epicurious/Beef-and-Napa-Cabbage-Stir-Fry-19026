Stir together soy sauce, vinegar, oyster sauce, and cornstarch. Pat steak dry, then halve lengthwise and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Toss with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Heat wok over high heat until a drop of water evaporates immediately. Add 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, swirling to coat, then stir-fry garlic and ginger until golden and fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add beef, quickly spreading pieces in 1 layer on bottom and sides of wok. Cook, undisturbed, 2 minutes, then stir-fry until meat is just browned but still pink in center, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl. Wipe wok clean, then swirl in remaining tablespoon oil and stir-fry cabbage stems over high heat until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Add cabbage leaves and beef with juices, then stir soy mixture and add. Stir-fry until sauce is simmering and slightly thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Discard ginger if desired; season with salt.
