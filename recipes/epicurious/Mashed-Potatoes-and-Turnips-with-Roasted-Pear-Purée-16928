(Pear puree can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Cook potatoes and turnips in separate large pots of generously salted water until tender, about 25 minutes. Drain well.

(Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm in microwave before continuing.) Rewarm pear puree. Place potato-turnip mixture in large serving bowl. Swirl in pear puree and serve.
