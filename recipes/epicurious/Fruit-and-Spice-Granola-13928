Preheat oven to 350°F. In a large bowl stir together oats. coconut, nuts, and spices. In a small saucepan melt butter with honey over low heat, stirring occasionally. Pour butter mixture over oat mixture and toss to combine well. Spread granola evenly in 2 shallow baking pans and bake in upper and lower thirds of oven, stirring frequently and switching position of pans halfway through baking, until golden brown, about 30 minutes. In large bowl combine granola with dried fruits and cool, stirring occasionally. (Granola keeps in an airtight container, chilled, 1 month.)
