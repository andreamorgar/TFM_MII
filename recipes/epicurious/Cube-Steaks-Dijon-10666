Sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add steaks in single layer and cook until browned, turning once, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to work surface; cut each steak in half. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in same skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallots and sage; sauté until soft, about 30 seconds. Add vermouth; boil until slightly reduced, about 30 seconds. Stir in cream and mustard. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper. Divide steaks among plates, spoon sauce over, and serve.
