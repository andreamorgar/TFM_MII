Preheat oven to 375°F. Cut baguette crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. In a saucepan melt butter with salt to taste over moderate heat and brush butter on one side of each slice. Arrange baguette slices, buttered sides up, on 2 large baking sheets and toast in upper and middle thirds of oven until golden, about 12 minutes. (Toasts may be made 2 days ahead and kept in an airtight container.) Drain beans in a colander. Gently rinse beans and drain well. Mince parsley. In a food processor blend together all spread ingredients except oil until smooth. With motor running, add oil in a slow stream, blending until incorporated, and season spread with salt and pepper. (Spread may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring spread to room temperature before serving.)
