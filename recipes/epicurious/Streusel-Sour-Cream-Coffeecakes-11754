Preheat oven to 350°F. Stir together granulated sugar, flour, salt, and 3/4 cup brown sugar in a large bowl, then blend in 1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cup) butter with your fingertips or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal with some pea-size butter lumps. Transfer 3/4 cup to a bowl and blend in cinnamon, remaining 1/2 stick (1/4 cup) butter, and remaining 1/4 cup brown sugar with your fingertips or pastry blender until crumbly. Stir in pecans, then chill streusel topping 15 minutes. Whisk together sour cream, whole egg, yolk, vanilla, baking soda, and zest, then stir into remaining flour mixture until just combined (batter will be stiff). Divide batter among 18 well-buttered muffin cups (they'll be about two-thirds full; butter tops of tins as well). Sprinkle each with streusel topping, pressing it lightly into batter. Bake coffeecakes in middle of oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in pans on racks 30 minutes. Loosen cakes with a sharp small knife, then carefully remove cakes from pans.
