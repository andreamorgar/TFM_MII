Preheat oven to 325°F. Combine half and half, sugar and honey in medium saucepan. Bring to simmer. Remove from heat; stir in chopped almonds and ground cardamom. Cover and let steep 30 minutes. Strain through fine sieve; discard solids in sieve. Whisk egg yolks in medium bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in half and half mixture. Place six 3/4-cup custard cups or soufflé dishes in roasting pan. Divide custard mixture among custard cups. Pour enough hot water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of cups. Bake custards until set around edges and center moves only slightly when cups are gently shaken, about 45 minutes. Remove custards from water. Cool. Cover and refrigerate overnight. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Keep refrigerated.)
