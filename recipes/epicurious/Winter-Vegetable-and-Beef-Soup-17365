Heat 2 tablespoons oil in very large pot over medium-high heat. Sprinkle beef with salt and pepper. Add beef to pot; sauté until outside is no longer pink, about 4 minutes. Add diced carrots, chopped onion, chopped garlic cloves, bay leaves, and thyme. Sauté 5 minutes. Add 6 cups beef broth, tomatoes with juice, chopped cabbage, and potatoes. Bring to simmer. Partially cover pot, reduce heat, and simmer until beef and vegetables are tender, about 50 minutes. Stir in corn kernels and peas; simmer until tender, about 5 minutes. Thin soup with more broth if too thick. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
