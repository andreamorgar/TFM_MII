Combine sugar, brown sugar and water in heavy small saucepan. Stir over medium-low heat until both sugars dissolve. Add butter and stir until melted. Increase heat and boil until sauce is reduced to 1/2 cup, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix in Frangelico and nuts. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Before using, stir over low heat until heated through and smooth.) Scoop frozen yogurt into bowls. Spoon warm sauce over. Top with berries.
