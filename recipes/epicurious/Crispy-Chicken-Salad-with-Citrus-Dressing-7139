Mix flour and cornstarch in large bowl. Mix green onions, eggs, soy sauce, ginger, fish sauce, lemon peel, garlic, salt and crushed red pepper in medium bowl. Whisk into flour mixture. Using rolling pin, lightly pound each chicken breast between sheets of waxed paper to 1/4- to 1/2-inch thickness. Add enough oil to heavy large saucepan to reach depth of 3 inches. Heat oil to 350°F. Working in batches, dip chicken into batter, turning to coat; fry chicken until golden brown and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer chicken to paper towels; drain. Cut chicken crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Toss greens in large bowl with enough Citrus Dressing to coat. Divide greens among 8 plates. Top with chicken, dividing equally. Drizzle 1 tablespoon dressing over chicken on each plate.
