Bring 1 1/2 cups water to boil in medium saucepan. Stir in bulgur. Remove from heat. Cover and let stand until bulgur is tender, about 40 minutes. Drain well. Cool completely. Whisk oil, lemon juice, garlic and remaining 2 tablespoons water in large bowl to blend. Add shrimp, tomatoes, cucumber, green onions, basil, mint, dill and bulgur and toss to blend. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Cover and chill.)
