Preheat the oven to 400°F. Set out all four chicken cutlets on a cutting board and sprinkle with the paprika, onion powder, and black pepper. Place a slice of the prosciutto on top of each chicken cutlet, then a collard leaf. Roll the stacks up, chicken on the outside, and secure with a toothpick. Coat a large, oven-safe skillet with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Place over high heat and add the chicken roulades. Brown for 3–4 minutes, turning often. Transfer the skillet with the chicken to the oven and bake for 10–15 minutes until the chicken is cooked through. Transfer to a clean cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes. Place the watercress in a large bowl along with the remaining 3 tablespoons oil and the vinegar and toss well to coat. Divide the watercress equally among four plates. Top with the figs. Slice the chicken and arrange over the watercress. Serve immediately.
