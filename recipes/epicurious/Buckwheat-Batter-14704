In a small saucepan cook butter over moderately low heat until golden brown with a nutlike fragrance. (Bottom of pan will be covered with brown specks.) Into a bowl sift flours and salt. In another bowl whisk together milk, eggs, and brown butter. Add milk mixture to flour mixture, whisking until smooth. Chill batter, covered, 30 minutes.
