Using on/off turns, finely chop olives and tomatoes in processor. Add 2/3 cup oil, capers, and oregano; blend to coarse puree. Transfer to bowl. (Tapenade can be made 3 days ahead. Cover; refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before using.) Preheat oven to 350°F. Place bread slices on baking sheet. Brush lightly with additional oil. Bake until golden, about 10 minutes. Spread tomato tapenade on toasts and serve.
