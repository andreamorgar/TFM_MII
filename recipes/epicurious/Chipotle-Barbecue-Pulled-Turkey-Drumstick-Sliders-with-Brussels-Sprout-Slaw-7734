Preheat oven to 325°F. Remove turkey skin. Cook onion in oil with 1/2 teaspoon salt in Dutch oven over medium heat, covered, stirring occasionally, until well softened, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and spices and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Stir in ketchup, vinegar, chiles, Worcestershire sauce, molasses, and 1/2 cup water and simmer mixture, stirring, 1 minute. Add drumsticks and cover pot, then braise in oven, turning drumsticks over once, until meat is very tender, about 2 hours. Transfer drumsticks to a bowl and cool. Discard bones, tendons, and any remaining skin, and pull meat with forks or fingers into coarse shreds. Stir meat into sauce remaining in pot. Thin, if necessary, with water to desired consistency and season with salt and pepper. Reheat over medium heat until hot. Spoon mixture into slider rolls and top with slaw.
