Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and bay leaf and sauté until onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in salt, thyme, and white pepper. Add rice; stir 2 minutes to coat. Add broth and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until rice is just tender and broth is absorbed, about 17 minutes. Discard bay leaf. (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm in microwave before using.)
