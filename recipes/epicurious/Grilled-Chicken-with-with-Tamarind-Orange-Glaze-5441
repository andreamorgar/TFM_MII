Place chicken in shallow bowl. Whisk next 5 ingredients in medium bowl. Pour over chicken; turn to coat. Cover; chill at least 1 hour and up to 6 hours, turning often. Whisk broth, juice, sugar, 3 tablespoons butter, tamarind paste, peel, and ginger in large saucepan. Boil mixture over medium-high heat until reduced to 3/4 cup and glaze coats back of spoon, stirring often, about 25 minutes. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cool glaze, then cover and chill. Rewarm over medium heat, whisking occasionally.) Whisk in 3 tablespoons butter. Season glaze with salt and pepper. Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Reserve 1/4 cup glaze in bowl. Grill chicken until cooked through, basting with reserved glaze, about 5 minutes per side. Arrange chicken atop rice on platter. Spoon remaining glaze over chicken. Tamarind paste, a tart, seedless paste, is available at Middle Eastern, Indian, and some Asian markets.
