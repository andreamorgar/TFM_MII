Place beans in large saucepan. Add enough water to cover by 3 inches. Bring to boil. Remove from heat. Cover and let stand 2 hours. Drain. Heat oil in heavy large Dutch oven over high heat. Season oxtails with salt and pepper. Working in batches, coat oxtails with flour; shake off excess. Add to Dutch oven and cook until golden brown on all sides, about 10 minutes per batch. Transfer oxtails to platter. Drain all but 3 tablespoons drippings from pot. Add all onions, garlic, ginger, thyme, oregano, jalapeéo, pepper and bay leaves. Sauté until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add wine, 1/2 cup broth, sugar and oxtails. Bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer 1 hour. Add lima beans and 1 cup broth to stew. Cover and simmer until oxtails and beans are tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Skim any fat from surface of stew. Season to taste with salt.
