Cut 1 medium zucchini into matchstick-size pieces. Heat 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil in a large skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium heat. Add zucchini; cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender, 3-4 minutes. Season with kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, and gochugaru (coarse Korean red pepper powder).
