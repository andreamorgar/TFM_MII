Trim fennel (reserving fronds) and remove tough outer layer. Thinly slice fennel crosswise and cauliflower lengthwise (1/8 inch). Slice asparagus on a diagonal (1/8 inch). Combine vegetables in a large bowl. Purée yolks, garlic, anchovies, mustard, lemon juice, and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper in a blender. With motor running, add oil in a slow stream, blending until dressing is thick and emulsified. Toss vegetables with enough dressing to coat. Season with salt. Sprinkle with fennel fronds.
