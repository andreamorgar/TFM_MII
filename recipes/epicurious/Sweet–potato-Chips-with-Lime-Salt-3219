Finely grate enough lime zest to measure 1/2 teaspoon and in a small cup stir together with salt. Peel sweet potato and using a vegetable peeler shave as many long strips as possible from potato. In a deep 10-inch heavy skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until a deep-fat thermometer registers 375°F. and fry potato strips in 3 batches, stirring frequently, until lightly browned and bubbling stops, about 1 minute. Transfer chips as fried with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and sprinkle with lime salt.
