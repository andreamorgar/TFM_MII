Heat oil in large pot over medium heat. Add shallots and garlic; sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Add Sherry, tomatoes with juice, paprika, and saffron; sprinkle with salt and generous amount of pepper. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium; boil gently 3 minutes to blend flavors. Add mussels and half of parsley; cover and cook until mussels open, about 3 minutes (discard any mussels that do not open). Stir in remaining parsley. Divide mussels and juices among bowls and serve.
