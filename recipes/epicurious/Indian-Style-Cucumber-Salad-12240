Toss cucumber with salt in a colander in sink and let drain 30 minutes, then pat dry. Toast cumin seeds in a dry small heavy skillet over low heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant and a shade darker, 3 to 4 minutes. Cool on a cutting board, then crush slightly with a rolling pin. Stir cucumber, cumin, and cilantro into yogurt in a bowl.
