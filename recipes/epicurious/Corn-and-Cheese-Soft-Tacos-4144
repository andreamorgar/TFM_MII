Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 8x8x2-inch glass baking dish. Heat oil in heavy small skillet over medium heat. Add bell pepper; sauté until beginning to soften, about 4 minutes. Transfer pepper mixture to large bowl. Mix in 1 3/4 cups cheese, corn kernels, creamed corn, tomatoes, sour cream, chilies, olives and cilantro. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon mixture into prepared dish. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese. Bake 15 minutes. Wrap tortillas in foil. Bake alongside casserole until tortillas and casserole are heated through, about 10 minutes more. Serve immediately.
