Cook kale in large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain. Cool; squeeze dry. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and sauté until tender, about 7 minutes. Cool. Finely chop tofu, cheeses, dill and flour in processor. Transfer to bowl. Stir in onion mixture, kale and sun-dried tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray large baking sheet with oil spray. Stack 2 phyllo sheets, one atop the other, on work surface; spray phyllo with oil spray. Top with 2 more phyllo sheets. Spray with oil spray. Repeat with remaining 2 phyllo sheets. Spread tofu mixture lengthwise down center of phyllo in 3-inch-wide strip, leaving about 1 1/2-inch border on each short side. Fold short sides of phyllo in over filling, then roll up into log, enclosing filling completely. Spray phyllo log with oil spray. Transfer strudel to prepared baking sheet. Bake strudel until golden brown, about 40 minutes. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Rewarm in 350°F oven until heated through, about 15 minutes.) Cool 10 minutes. Cut strudel crosswise into 6 pieces. Place on plates. Spoon Red Pepper Sauce alongside.
