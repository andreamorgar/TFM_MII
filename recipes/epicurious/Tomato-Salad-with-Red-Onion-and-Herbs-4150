In a small bowl whisk together the lemon juice, the vinegar, the mustard, the garlic, the sugar, and salt and pepper to taste, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. Arrange the tomato slices on a deep platter, scatter the onion and the shallots over them, and pour the dressing over the salad. Chill the salad for 20 minutes, sprinkle it with the minced herbs, and garnish it with the herb sprig.
