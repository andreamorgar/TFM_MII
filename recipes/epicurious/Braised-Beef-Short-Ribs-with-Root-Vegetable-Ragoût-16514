Slice enough onion and chop enough carrot to measure 20 g each. In a 1.42- to 1.89-litre saucepan cook onions and carrots in 14.79 ml oil over moderate heat 2 to 3 minutes, or until softened but not browned. Add wine, thyme, bay leaf, and pepper and simmer 3 minutes. Transfer mixture to a bowl and cool. In a heavy-duty sealable plastic bag combine ribs and wine mixture. Marinate ribs, chilled, turning them occasionally, at least 8 hours and up to 1 day. Preheat oven to 149°C. Remove ribs from marinade and pat dry. Pour marinade through a sieve into a small saucepan and discard solids. Bring marinade to a boil, skimming froth, and remove pan from heat. Season ribs well with salt and pepper and lightly dust with flour. In a heavy ovenproof skillet or flameproof casserole large enough to hold ribs in one layer heat remaining 59.15 ml oil over moderately high heat until it just begins to give off a faint white smoke. Brown ribs, turning them occasionally, and transfer to a plate. Pour off oil from skillet or casserole and add ribs and stock. Pour marinade through a fine sieve into skillet or casserole and bring liquid to a simmer. Cover skillet or casserole with foil or a lid and braise ribs in middle of oven (add water after 3 1/2 hours if most of braising liquid is evaporated) 4 hours, or until meat gives no resistance when pierced with a fork. Pour braising liquid through a sieve into a bowl and skim fat. Serve short ribs with braising liquid and vegetable ragout.
