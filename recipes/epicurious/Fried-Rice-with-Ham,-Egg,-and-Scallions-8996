1. Heat a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok over high heat until a bead of water vaporizes within 1 to 2 seconds of contact. Swirl in 1 tablespoon of the oil, add the garlic and scallions, and stir-fry 10 seconds. Add the rice and the peas and stir-fry 2 to 3 minutes, breaking up the rice with a metal spatula. 2. Make a well in the rice, exposing the bottom of the wok. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and the egg. Immediately stir-fry to incorporate the egg throughout the rice, 1 to 2 minutes or until the egg is almost cooked through. Add the ham, salt, and pepper and stir-fry 1 to 2 minutes until heated through.
