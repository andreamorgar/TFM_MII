Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and garlic; sauté until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add clams, 1/2 cup tomatoes and wine; bring to boil. Cover; cook until clams open, about 8 minutes. Using tongs, transfer clams to bowl; discard any that do not open. Cover clams with foil. Meanwhile, cook linguine in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain pasta. Add to skillet. Add arugula and 1/2 cup tomatoes; toss over high heat until pasta is coated, 2 minutes. Place pasta in large bowl. Top with clams. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil.
