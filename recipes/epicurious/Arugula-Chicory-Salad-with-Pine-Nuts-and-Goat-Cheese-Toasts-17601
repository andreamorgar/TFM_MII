Preheat broiler. Whisk together vinegar, lemon juice, mustard, and salt and pepper to taste and add oil in a slow stream, whisking. Toss arugula, chicory, pine nuts, and tomatoes in a large bowl with just enough vinaigrette to coat, then divide among 4 plates. Spread goat cheese on baguette slices and broil on a baking sheet 6 inches from heat until cheese is softened and edges of bread are golden, about 2 minutes. Arrange toasts on salads and drizzle any remaining vinaigrette over cheese.
