Heat 4 cups canola oil in a 2-quart pot to 375°F. Working in batches, deep-fry the cubes of tofu until golden brown, making sure they don't stick to each other. Wait between batches for oil to return to 375°. Drain tofu on paper towels. Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat until hot. Add 3 tablespoons canola oil. Add onion and garlic, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring. Add tomatoes and cook, stirring carefully, just until tomatoes begin start to break down, about 1 to 2 minutes. Deglaze with mirin and cook for approximately 1 to 2 minutes. Add the tofu and green onions, stir, and season with salt to taste.
