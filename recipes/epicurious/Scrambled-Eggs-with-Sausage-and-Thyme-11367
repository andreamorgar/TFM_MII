Whisk eggs, mustard, salt and pepper in large bowl to blend well. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in 12-inch-diameter non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add sausage and stir until brown, about 3 minutes. Add green onions and thyme and stir 1 minute. Transfer mixture to bowl. Add 2 tablespoons butter to same skillet; melt over medium heat. Add eggs and cheese; stir until eggs are softly set and cheese begins to melt, about 3 minutes. Add sausage; stir until eggs are just set, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer to platter. Garnish with thyme sprigs, if desired.
