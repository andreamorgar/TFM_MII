Combine cream, honey, brandy and salt in medium saucepan. Stir over high heat until mixture comes to a boil. Remove from heat. Add chocolate and whisk until melted. Whisk in vanilla. Let stand until cool but still pourable. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill. Before serving, stir over low heat until just liquid but not warm.)
