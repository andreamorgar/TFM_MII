Fill medium bowl with ice water. Cook parsley in pot of lightly salted boiling water just until bright green, about 5 seconds. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking liquid. Transfer parsley to ice water. Drain well. Coarsely chop parsley. Combine parsley, reserved 1/2 cup cooking liquid, 2 tablespoons olive oil, marjoram, 1/2 teaspoon lemon peel, and pinch of nutmeg in blender; puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. (Parsley puree can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Stir over medium heat until heated through before serving.) Cover to keep warm. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle sea bass with salt and pepper. Add to skillet and sauté until golden on bottom, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon sugar and pinch of nutmeg over top of each fish fillet. Turn fish over and cook until golden on second side and opaque in center, about 4 minutes longer. Transfer 1 sea bass fillet to each of 4 plates. Drizzle 1 teaspoon pan drippings over each. Spoon warm parsley puree around each fillet. Drizzle 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice around each fillet. Garnish with additional lemon peel, if desired.
