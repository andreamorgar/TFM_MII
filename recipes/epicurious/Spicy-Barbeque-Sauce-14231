Heat vegetable oil in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and celery and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, paprika and cayenne and stir 1 minute. Add ketchup, beer, vinegar and Worcestershire sauce. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer uncovered until flavors blend and sauce is slightly reduced, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes. (Can be prepared 1 week ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
