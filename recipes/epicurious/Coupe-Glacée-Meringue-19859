Preheat oven to 200°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using an electric mixer, beat egg whites on medium-high speed in a medium bowl until white and foamy. With mixer running, gradually add sugar by tablespoonfuls, beating until meringue is stiff and glossy. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean. Add honey and continue to beat until seeds are evenly dispersed and no streaks of honey remain. Drop meringue by heaping tablespoonfuls onto prepared baking sheet. Bake until dry and slightly golden, about 2 hours. Let meringues cool on sheet (they will crisp as they cool). Combine berries, honey, and lemon juice in a medium bowl. Toss to combine. Let stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour to allow juices to form. Coarsely crumble meringues. Divide berries and juices among small bowls. Scoop vanilla ice cream into each bowl. Top with crumbled meringues. Garnish with mint.
