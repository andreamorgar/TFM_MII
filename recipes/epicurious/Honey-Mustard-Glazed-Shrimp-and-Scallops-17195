In small bowl, stir together honey, vinegar, mustard, oil, salt, and pepper with fork. Place 1 scallop inside curve of 1 shrimp and secure with long wooden toothpick or short wooden skewer. Repeat with remaining shrimp and scallops. Lightly brush grill pan with oil and heat over moderate heat until just beginning to smoke. Working in batches, transfer hors d'oeuvres to pan, cover loosely with foil, and cook 3 minutes. Turn with tongs or spatula, cover again, and cook until shrimp are firm and pink and scallops are just cooked through (do not overcook), 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to platter and brush with honey-mustard mixture. Serve immediately.
