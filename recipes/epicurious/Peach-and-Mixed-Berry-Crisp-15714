Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 8x8x2 1/2-inch square baking dish. Toss fruit, sugar and 2 tablespoons flour in large bowl to combine. Transfer to prepared baking dish. Bake fruit until juices bubble, stirring occasionally, about 40 minutes. Bake without stirring another 5 minutes. Remove from oven. Increase oven temperature to 400°F. Meanwhile, whisk remaining 3/4 cup flour, sugar, cinnamon, ginger and salt in medium bowl to blend. Add butter and rub in with fingertips until small moist clumps form. Sprinkle topping evenly over hot fruit in dish. Bake crisp until topping is golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool slightly. Serve warm with ice cream.
