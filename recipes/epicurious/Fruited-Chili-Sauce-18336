Cut out the stem end of the tomatoes and peel. Cut fruits and vegetables into fine dice and place in a large preserving kettle. Add salt, vinegar, sugar and allspice (tied in a cheesecloth bag). Bring to a boil and cook uncovered over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until thick. Discard the spice bag and ladle the sauce into hot, sterilized jars. Cover and seal.
