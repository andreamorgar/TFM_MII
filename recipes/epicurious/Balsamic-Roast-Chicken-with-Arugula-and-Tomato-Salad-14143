Preheat oven to 450°F. Whisk oil, vinegar, and garlic in small bowl to blend. Season dressing generously with salt and pepper. Transfer 1/4 cup dressing to large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken and turn to coat. Let marinate 10 minutes. Place chicken, skin side up and still coated with marinade, onto rimmed baking sheet. Roast until brown and cooked through, about 25 minutes. Meanwhile, combine arugula, tomatoes, and cheese in large bowl. Mix in all but 2 tablespoons of remaining dressing. Divide salad among 4 plates. Cut chicken off bone. Slice chicken crosswise on slight diagonal. Overlap chicken slices atop each salad. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons dressing and serve.
