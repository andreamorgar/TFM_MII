Peel potatoes, putting them in a bowl of cold water as peeled to prevent discoloration. Drain potatoes, then steam in a steamer set over boiling water, covered, until tender, 18 to 20 minutes. Toss hot potatoes with wine in a large bowl, then add oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and toss again. Cool to room temperature.
