Steam squash on a streamer rack set over boiling water, covered, until tender, about 5 to 8 minutes. In a skillet cook bacon over moderate heat until crisp, reserving 2 teaspoons bacon fat. Crumble bacon into a bowl and toss with squash, juice, Tabasco, reserved bacon fat, and salt and pepper to taste.
