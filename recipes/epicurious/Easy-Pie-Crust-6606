Blend first 4 ingredients in processor. Add butter and shortening and cut in using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 3 tablespoons ice water and process until moist clumps form, adding more water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic; refrigerate 1 hour. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Keep refrigerated. Soften dough slightly at room temperature before rolling out.) Roll out dough disk on floured surface to 12-inch round.
