Preheat broiler. For marinade, combine soy sauce, chili paste, scallion whites, red wine, garlic, ginger, and black pepper in a bowl. Add chicken and let marinate. Cook pasta in salted boiling water until al dente; drain. For dressing, whisk together mustard, vinegar, sesame oil, and 2 tbsp canola oil. Toss pasta, red pepper, watercress and all but 2 tbsp scallion greens with dressing. In a blender, puree mangoes, lime juice, and remaining 1 tbsp canola oil. Coat broiler pan with cooking spray and add chicken in a single layer. Broil 6 to 7 minutes per side, until browned and cooked through. Cut breasts diagonally in half. On each plate, place 1/4 pasta and 2 pieces chicken. Drizzle with mango puree and garnish with remaining scallion greens.
