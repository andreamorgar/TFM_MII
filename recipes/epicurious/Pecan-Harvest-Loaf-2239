Grease an 8 x 4-inch loaf pan and preheat the oven to 350°F. Sift the flour with the baking powder and salt. Add the ground pecans and mix well. Cream the butter and sugars and add the egg yolks, milk, coffee, and vanilla. Beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry. Add the flour and pecans to the wet ingredients. When just combined, fold in the egg whites. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 45 to 50 minutes, until done. (Insert a straw or cake tester into the center of the loaf. If it comes out clean, it's done, or if loaf has a springy feel when you press on it.) Allow to cool slightly, then glaze with Lemon Glaze.
