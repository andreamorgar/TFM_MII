Sprinkle the chicken well with salt and pepper. Heat the oil and butter in a heavy-bottomed skillet. Add the chickenbreasts and sauté over medium-high heat, turning the pieces often until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Scatter the shallots and garlic around the chicken. Cook briefly; add the tarragon, tomatoes, vinegar, capers, wine, and tomato paste. Stir to dissolve the brown particles adhering to the bottom of the skillet. Blend well. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.
