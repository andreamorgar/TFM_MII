Drizzle 2 tablespoons olive oil over lamb. Rub lamb with pressed garlic and 2 tablespoons oregano. Season generously with salt and pepper. Let stand 1 hour at room temperature. Preheat oven to 400°F. Place lamb on heavy large baking sheet with 1-inch-high sides. Roast lamb in oven 1 hour. Add potatoes and unpeeled garlic cloves to baking sheet. Drizzle potatoes with remaining olive oil and sprinkle with remaining oregano. Season potatoes generously with salt and pepper. Continue cooking lamb and potatoes until lamb is cooked to desired doneness, 40 minutes for medium rare. Transfer lamb to platter. Pour off any juices on baking sheet and reserve. Continue roasting potatoes until potatoes are brown and tender, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Arrange potatoes around lamb on platter. Degrease reserved juices. Slip garlic cloves from skins; mix with reserved juices. Serve lamb and potatoes, spooning juices over lamb.
