In a skillet heat the oil over moderately high heat and in it stir-fry the garlic, the gingerroot, and the red bell pepper until the pepper is softened. Add the beans and stir-fry the mixture for 2 minutes. Add the Sherry and boil the mixture for 1 minute. Stir in the soy sauce, the sugar, and the broth and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. In a small bowl dissolve the cornstarch in 2 teaspoons cold water, whisk it into the mixture, and simmer the sauce until it is thickened slightly. Add black pepper to taste and serve the sauce over asparagus.
