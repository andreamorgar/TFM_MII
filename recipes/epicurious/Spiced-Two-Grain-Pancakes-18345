In a blender blend all pancake ingredients except oi until just combined. Heat a griddle over moderate heat until hot enough to make a drop of water scatter over surface and brush with oil. Working in batches, drop scant 1/4-cup measures of batter onto griddle to form pancakes about 4 inches in diameter and cook until bubbles appear on surface and undersides are brown, about 2 minutes. Flip pancakes with a metal spatula and cook until undersides are golden brown and pancakes are cooked through, about 2 minutes. Serve pancakes with syrup.
