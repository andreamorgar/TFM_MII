Cut ends from plantains and peel fruit. Diagonally cut plantains into 1/2-inch-thick slices. In a 12-inch nonstick skillet heat butter over moderate heat until foam subsides and cook plantains until golden, about 3 minutes on each side. With a slotted spatula transfer plantains to a plate, reserving butter in skillet. In a very small saucepan heat rum and coconut milk until warm. Add sugar to reserved butter and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until caramelized, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and carefully whisk in warm coconut milk mixture (mixture will vigorously steam and caramel will harden). Cook mixture over low heat, whisking, until caramel is dissolved. Add plantains and cook, without stirring, until heated through and tender, about 5 minutes. In very small saucepan heat cream until warm and pour over plantains. Gently shake skillet to incorporate cream into sauce. Cool plantains slightly and serve over ice cream.
