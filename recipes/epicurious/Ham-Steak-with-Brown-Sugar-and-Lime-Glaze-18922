Whisk sugar and lime juice in small bowl to form paste; rub over both sides of ham steak. Place ham on plate and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours (paste may liquefy). Melt butter in medium skillet over medium heat. Add ham to skillet with sugar paste still clinging and sauté until brown and heated through, about 3 minutes per side.
