Preheat oven to 425°F. Sift flour, dark brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg and salt into large bowl. Add dried currants. Melt 1/4 cup unsalted butter with dark molasses in heavy small saucepan over low heat. Combine molasses mixture with buttermilk and pour into dry ingredients. Mix dough until just blended. Gently knead dough on generously floured surface until smooth, about 20 turns. Divide dough in half. Pat out each dough piece into 5-inch-diameter round. Cut each dough round into 4 wedges. Transfer dough wedges to ungreased cookie sheet, spacing 2 inches apart. Brush with melted butter. Sprinkle with sugar. Bake until scones are just firm to touch, about 20 minutes. Serve scones hot.
