Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 450°F. Divide turkey necks and wings between 2 heavy large rimmed baking sheets, spreading in single layer. Roast 30 minutes. Using tongs, turn turkey parts over; scatter carrots, onions, and celery over, dividing equally. Roast until turkey parts are golden brown, about 1 hour longer. Transfer turkey parts, vegetables, and any pan juices to heavy large pot. Place each baking sheet over 2 burners; add 1 cup water to each sheet and bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits. Pour mixture into pot with vegetables. Add bay leaves, peppercorns, salt, and remaining 18 cups water to pot; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover partially, and simmer gently for 2 1/2 hours. Strain broth and cool slightly. Do ahead: Can be made 2 days ahead. Refrigerate uncovered until cold, then cover and chill. Before using, scrape any fat from surface of broth; reserve fat for gravy.
