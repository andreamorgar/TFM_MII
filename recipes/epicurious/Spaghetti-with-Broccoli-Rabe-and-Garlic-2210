Cook pasta according to package instructions. When pasta is 5 minutes from finished, add broccoli rabe to pot and continue to cook until pasta is al dente. Drain in a colander and transfer to a large serving bowl. Meanwhile, cook remaining ingredients in a small heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until garlic is pale golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour over pasta and toss to combine.
