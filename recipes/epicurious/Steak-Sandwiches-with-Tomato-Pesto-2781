In a small saucepan cook garlic in oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened and cool. In a small food processor or blender purée tomatoes, basil, oil mixture, and vinegar until pesto is smooth. In a bowl toss steak with half of pesto and spread remaining pesto on bread. Divide steak among 4 bread slices and top with remaining 4 slices.
