Bring butter to a boil in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat. Once foam completely covers butter, reduce heat to very low. Continue to cook butter, stirring occasionally, until a thin crust begins to form on surface and milky white solids fall to bottom of pan, about 8 minutes. Continue to cook butter, watching constantly and stirring occasionally to prevent burning, until solids turn light brown and butter deepens to golden and becomes translucent and fragrant, 16 to 18 minutes. Remove ghee from heat and pour through a sieve lined with a triple layer of cheesecloth into a jar.
