Cook bacon in a 12-inch nonstick skillet until crisp and transfer to paper towels to drain. Keep warm, covered. Pour off fat from skillet and wipe clean with paper towels. Spread 1 side of each toast with 1 tablespoon chutney, or to taste. Whisk together eggs and cream and season with salt and pepper. Heat butter in skillet over moderately low heat until foam subsides, then cook egg mixture, stirring slowly, until just cooked through. Make sandwiches with toasts, scrambled eggs, bacon, and arugula.
