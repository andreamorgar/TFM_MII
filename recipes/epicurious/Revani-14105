Bring sugar, water, and lemon juice to a boil, simmer 15 minutes. Cool. Beat the egg yolks, sugar and lemon rind with an electric beater for 5 minutes or until pale yellow. Wash and dry the beater. Fold the semolina and flour into the beaten yolks until well blended. Set aside. Beat the egg whites with the clean beater until stiff. Alternate gently folding the egg whites and the melted butter into the yolk and flour mix. Pour batter into a well greased and floured 9x12 inch or 10x12 inch baking pan. Bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 40 minutes, or until a pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Pour the syrup over the hot cake. Let it stand for several hours until the syrup is absorbed and the cake is cool. Cut the cake into squares. Serve with whipped cream and sprinkle nuts on top.
