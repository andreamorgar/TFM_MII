Thinly slice onion and mince garlic. Peel gingerroot and mince. In a sieve rinse lentils and drain. In a 2-quart heavy saucepan cook onion and garlic in 1 tablespoon oil over moderate heat, stirring, until golden. Add gingerroot and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add lentils and water and gently boil, uncovered, until lentils fall apart, about 20 minutes. While lentils are boiling, rinse tofu and trim ends. Cut tofu into 1/2-inch cubes and gently press between paper towels to remove excess moisture. In a small heavy skillet heat remaining tablespoon oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook cumin seeds, stirring, until a shade darker, about 1 minute. Add garam masala, salt, and cayenne and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 15 to 30 seconds. Stir hot spice oil into lentils and gently stir in tofu cubes. Let curry stand, covered, 5 minutes to allow flavors to develop. Stir in cilantro and salt to taste. Serve curry over rice.
