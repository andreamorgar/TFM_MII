Preheat oven to 350°F. In a bowl whisk together flour, baking powder, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, and salt. In another bowl with an electric mixer cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy and beat in egg. Beat in flour mixture and stir in ginger and chocolate chips. Drop dough by rounded teaspoons 3 inches apart onto buttered baking sheets and bake cookies in batches in middle of oven 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden. Cool cookies on baking sheet 1 minute and transfer to racks to cool completely. Cookies keep in airtight containers 5 days.
