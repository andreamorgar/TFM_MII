Combine broth and wild rice in small saucepan. Bring to boil. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 50 minutes. Transfer to medium bowl. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled. Add chicken or turkey, celery, apple, green onion and tarragon to wild rice. Whisk remaining ingredients to blend in small bowl. Pour over wild rice mixture and toss well. Season with salt and pepper.
