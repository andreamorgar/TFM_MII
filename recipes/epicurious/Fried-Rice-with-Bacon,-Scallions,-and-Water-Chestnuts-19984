Cut bacon crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces. Finely dice carrot and celery. Thinly slice scallions. Rinse and drain water chestnuts and finely chop. In a large nonstick skillet cook bacon over moderately low heat, stirring, until almost crisp. Add carrot and celery and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until vegetables are crisp-tender. Add scallions and water chestnuts and cook, stirring, until scallions are softened. Stir in remaining ingredients and salt and pepper to taste and cook, stirring, until mixture is combined well and heated through, 3 to 5 minutes.
