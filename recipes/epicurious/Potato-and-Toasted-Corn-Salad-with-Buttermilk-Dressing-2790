Cut potatoes into 3/4-inch wedges. In a large saucepan of boiling salted water cook potatoes until just tender, 8 to 10 minutes, and drain well. In a large skillet heat oil until hot but not smoking and cook corn, covered, over moderately high heat, shaking skillet occasionally, until browned, about 3 minutes. Cool corn slightly and combine with potatoes in a large bowl. Potatoes and corn may be cooked 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. In a small bowl stir together buttermilk, mayonnaise, and vinegar. To potatoes and corn add buttermilk mixture, scallions, and salt and pepper to taste, tossing to coat.
