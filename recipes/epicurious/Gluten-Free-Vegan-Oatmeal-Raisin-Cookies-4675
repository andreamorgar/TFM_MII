Preheat oven to 350° F. In a small bowl, whisk together the flax and water. Let sit for 2 minutes. In a separate bowl, whisk together the oats, flour, cinnamon, baking soda and salt. In the bowl of a standing mixer, or with an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the flax mixture and vanilla extract and stir until combined. Gradually add the flour mixture until just combined. Add the raisins and stir to thoroughly combine. Using a 2 tablespoon measure, place cookie dough onto Silpat or parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.
