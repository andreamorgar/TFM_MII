Heat heavy large skillet over medium-high heat 2 minutes. Add all chile pieces; cook just until chiles blister, pressing with metal spatula and turning occasionally, about 30 seconds. Transfer chiles to bowl; add 5 cups very hot water. Soak chiles until very tender, pushing occasionally to submerge, about 30 minutes. Working in 3 batches, puree chiles with soaking liquid and all remaining ingredients in blender until smooth. Season sauce with more salt, if desired. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
