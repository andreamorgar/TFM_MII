Cook linguine in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and crushed pepper; stir 30 seconds. Add tomatoes; sauté just until heated through, about 2 minutes. Mix in vinegar; season sauce with salt and pepper. Drain pasta and add to skillet; add watercress and 1 cup Parmesan cheese. Toss until watercress wilts and sauce coats pasta. Transfer to bowl. Serve, passing additional cheese separately.
