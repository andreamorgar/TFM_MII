Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Place chicken between sheets of plastic wrap and pound on work surface to thickness of 1/4 to 1/2 inch. Place chicken in glass baking dish. Pour 1/2 cup dressing over chicken. Sprinkle with rosemary; turn to coat. Let marinate at least 10 minutes and up to 2 hours. Remove chicken from marinade and place on grill rack. Dip lemon rounds into remaining 1/4 cup dressing and place on edge of rack. Grill chicken until cooked through and grill lemon until slightly charred, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes total. Transfer chicken to plates. Top with lemon rounds and serve.
