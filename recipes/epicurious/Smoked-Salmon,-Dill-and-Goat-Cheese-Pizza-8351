Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 450°F. Butter 12-inch-diameter pizza pan. Knead dough briefly on floured surface. Sprinkle 1/4 cup dill over and knead dough until dill is well incorporated. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 12-inch round. Transfer to prepared pan. Build up edges of dough to form rim. Brush dough lightly with olive oil. Sprinkle 1/4 cup dill over, then goat cheese. Top with onion. Bake until cheese melts and crust is golden brown, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle smoked salmon, olives and remaining 1/4 cup dill over.
