Combine oil and paprika in heavy small saucepan. Cook over medium heat 5 minutes to infuse oil, whisking occasionally. Cool to room temperature. Pour oil mixture into blender. Add garlic, thyme leaves, rosemary, salt, and pepper; blend marinade until herbs are finely chopped. Cut each pork tenderloin lengthwise into 4 strips. Place each strip between sheets of waxed paper and pound to 1/3-inch thickness. Arrange pork strips in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Pour marinade over and turn to coat pork evenly. Cover and chill at least 2 hours and up to 6 hours. Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Scrape off most of marinade from pork strips. Grill pork until just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Arrange 2 pork strips on each of 4 plates. Spoon pineapple salsa atop pork. *Available from Tienda.com (888-472-1022; tienda.com).
