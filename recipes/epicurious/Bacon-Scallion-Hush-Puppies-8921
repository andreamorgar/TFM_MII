Cook bacon in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, turning occasionally, until crisp. Transfer with a slotted spatula to paper towels to drain, then crumble. Preheat oven to 300°F. Heat oil in a 4- to 5-quart heavy pot (preferably cast-iron) over high heat until it registers 320°F on thermometer. While oil is heating, whisk together cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Whisk together egg and milk in a small bowl, then add to cornmeal mixture and stir until combined. Stir in bacon and scallions until just combined. Working in batches of 6, carefully add 1 tablespoon of batter per hush puppy to hot oil and fry, turning, until golden, 2 to 3 minutes, then transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain briefly. Transfer hush puppies to a shallow baking pan and keep hot in oven while frying remaining batter. Return oil to 320°F between batches.
