Preheat oven to 425°F. Shave potatoes lengthwise into long, wide ribbons with a vegetable peeler and toss strips with remaining ingredients. Lightly oil a 9-inch metal pie pan. Arrange strips in overlapping layers radiating from center, letting slices overhang slightly if necessary. Bake in lower third of oven until edges are browned, then cover edges with foil and bake until potatoes are tender and top of cake is crisp and brown, 45 to 50 minutes total.
