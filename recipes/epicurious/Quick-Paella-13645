1 In a large skillet with a lid, brown the sau-sage in the oil until crispy, about 5 minutes. 2 Add the rice, artichoke hearts, peppers, broth or wine, and 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil. 3 Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until most of the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. 4 Stir in the shrimp and peas. Cover and continue cooking until the shrimp are opaque, 5 to 7 minutes.
