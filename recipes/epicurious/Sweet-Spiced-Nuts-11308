Put oven rack in middle position and Preheat oven to 350°F. Toast hazelnuts in 1 layer in a large shallow baking pan (1 inch deep) until pale golden and skins are blistered, 10 to 15 minutes. Wrap nuts in a kitchen towel and let steam 1 to 2 minutes, then rub off any loose skins in towel (don't worry if some skins don't come off). Cool nuts completely on plate. Reduce oven temperature to 325°F and line shallow baking pan with parchment paper. Whisk together sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice in a large bowl. Whisk egg white in small bowl until foamy, then add hazelnuts and almonds and toss to coat. Transfer nuts to sugar mixture and toss to coat. Arrange nuts in 1 layer in pan and bake, shaking pan occasionally, until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool nuts completely in pan on a rack.
