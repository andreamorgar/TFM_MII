Peel, core, and chop 1/4 pineapple into chunks. Mix with 1/4 cup cilantro sprigs, 2 sliced chiles (such as jalapeño or serrano), 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon fish sauce, and 1 chopped garlic clove. Pour over 4 pork chops. Cover; chill at least 6 hours and up to 1 day. (Before marinating, set some marinade aside to use as a dipping sauce.) Remove pork from marinade; grill or broil.
