Sprinkle chicken with paprika; season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add chicken skin side down and cook, turning occasionally, until brown on all sides, 8-10 minutes; transfer to a plate. Add onion and garlic to pot and cook, stirring often, until softened, 8-10 minutes. Return chicken to pot; add broth, wine, and herbs. Bring to a boil; cover. Reduce heat; simmer until chicken is cooked through, 30-40 minutes. Add kale to pot. Cover; cook until wilted, about 5 minutes. Discard herbs. Serve chicken and kale with lemon wedges.
