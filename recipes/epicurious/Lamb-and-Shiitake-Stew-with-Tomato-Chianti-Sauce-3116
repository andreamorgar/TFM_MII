Heat oil in heavy large pot over high heat. Sprinkle lamb with salt and pepper. Add lamb to pot; sauté until light brown, about 5 minutes. Add next 5 ingredients; sauté until onion is golden, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes with juices and wine; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until lamb is tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Add olives to stew; simmer uncovered until sauce reduces and thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Season lamb stew with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool slightly. Refrigerate uncovered until cold, then cover and keep refrigerated. Rewarm over medium heat, adding water by tablespoonfuls to thin sauce if desired.) Divide orzo among 4 plates. Top with lamb stew and serve.
