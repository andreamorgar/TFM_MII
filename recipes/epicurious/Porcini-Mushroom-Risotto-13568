Bring 2 cups water to boil in heavy small saucepan. Add mushrooms. Cover; let stand until mushrooms soften, about 10 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer mushrooms to work surface; reserve soaking liquid. Chop mushrooms coarsely. Melt butter with oil in pressure cooker over medium-high heat. Add rice, shallots, and fennel seeds; stir 1 minute. Add wine and cook until almost evaporated, stirring frequently, about 1 minute. Mix in 2 cups broth and salt, then mushrooms and reserved mushroom soaking liquid, leaving any sediment behind in pan. Lock lid in place. Bring to high pressure over high heat. Cook rice 4 minutes, adjusting heat as necessary to maintain high pressure. Quick-release pressure. Slowly release lid, standing back and allowing steam to escape. Cook rice over medium-high heat until creamy and tender but still firm to bite, stirring often and adding more broth by 1/4 cupfuls if thinner consistency is desired, about 2 minutes. Mix in cheese and parsley. Season risotto to taste with pepper. *Dried porcini mushrooms are available at Italian markets, specialty foods stores, and many supermarkets.
