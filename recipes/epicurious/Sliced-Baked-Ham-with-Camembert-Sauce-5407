Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle. Overlap ham slices on a baking sheet and cover with foil. Bake until just heated through, 8 to 10 minutes. Bring cream to a simmer, then whisk in cheese until smooth. (If necessary, purée in a blender, then reheat.) Whisk in yolk and cook, whisking, 1 minute. Serve ham with sauce.
