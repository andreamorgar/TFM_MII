Melt butter in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add andouille sausage, poblano chiles, all bell peppers, and crushed red pepper. Sauté until sausage browns and vegetables begin to soften, stirring often, about 7 minutes. Add clams, Sherry, and cream. Cover pot and cook over medium-high heat until clams open, 5 to 6 minutes (discard any clams that do not open). Stir in 1/4 cup cilantro and Sherry wine vinegar. Season juices to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to large bowl. Sprinkle with remaining cilantro and serve.

Although native to Japan, Manila clams are becoming increasingly popular in the United States and can be found in the seafood section of most supermarkets. Pacific littleneck clams are a good substitute.
