Preheat oven to 350°F. Cut off and discard root ends of garlic cloves. On a 10-inch piece of foil, drizzle garlic with oil. Crimp foil to seal and bake in middle of oven until garlic is tender, about 30 minutes. Cool, then peel. While garlic is baking, lay bell peppers on their sides on racks of gas burners and turn flames on high. (Or put peppers on rack of broiler pan about 2 inches from heat.) Roast peppers, turning with tongs, until skins are blackened, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let stand, covered, until cool enough to handle. Peel peppers and discard stems and seeds. Coarsely chop peppers and purée in a blender with roasted garlic and chicken broth. Transfer purée to a saucepan. Heat over moderate heat, stirring, until warm, then season with salt and pepper. Stir together sour cream and milk. Drizzle 1 teaspoon sour-cream mixture over each serving of soup and sprinkle with chives.
