Preheat oven to 350°F. Line 8-inch square baking pan with foil; butter foil. Mix flour, sugar and salt in processor. Add butter and nuts and blend until fine meal forms. Press onto bottom of prepared pan. Bake until light brown around edges, about 18 minutes. Blend first 6 ingredients in processor. Pour filling onto hot crust. Bake until filling begins to brown at edges and is just springy to touch, about 20 minutes. Cool completely in pan on rack. Lift foil and dessert from pan. Gently peel foil from edges. Cut dessert into 16 squares. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Wrap tightly; chill.) Sift powdered sugar over squares; serve at room temperature.
