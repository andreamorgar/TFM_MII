Process pistachios, 10 basil leaves and garlic cloves in processor until finely chopped. Add 1/2 cup butter and 1 teaspoon lime juice and process until incorporated into mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer butter mixture to small bowl. Refrigerate until well chilled. (Pistachio butter can be prepared up to 4 days ahead.) Preheat oven to 400°F. Butter 9x13-inch baking dish. Place salmon fillets in dish in single layer. Pour white wine over. Season salmon with salt and pepper. Bake salmon until almost opaque on top, about 10 minutes. Place 2 tablespoons pistachio butter atop each salmon piece. Continue baking until salmon fillets are just opaque in center, about 5 minutes. Transfer salmon to plates. Garnish with basil if desired and serve immediately.
