Combine 2 cups water, salt, sugar, and chili powder in large nonreactive pot. Bring to boil, stirring to dissolve salt and sugar. Remove from heat. Add 6 cups cold water. Cool brine completely. Add pork chops, pressing to submerge. Cover pot; chill at least 6 hours and up to 1 day. Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Drain pork; pat dry with paper towels. Brush pork on both sides with oil; sprinkle with pepper. Grill pork to desired doneness, about 10 minutes per side or until instant-read thermometer registers 150°F for medium. Serve pork with Spicy Chutney Barbecue Sauce.
