Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until very tender, about 15 minutes. Drain well. Return potatoes to pot. Add cheese and 1/2 cup milk and mash until almost smooth, adding more milk by tablespoonfuls for desired consistency. Stir in chopped rosemary. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 8 hours ahead; cover and chill. Rewarm covered with plastic wrap in microwave, stirring occasionally and adding more milk, if desired.) Transfer mashed potatoes to bowl. Garnish with rosemary sprigs, if desired.
