In a large skillet cook the onions in 2 tablespoons of the butter over moderate heat, stirring, until they are softened and transfer them to a food processor. In the skillet melt 2 tablespoons of the remaining butter over moderately high heat until the foam subsides and in it sauté the chicken livers, patted dry and seasoned with salt and pepper, stirring, for 2 minutes, or until they are browned on the outside but still pink within. Transfer the livers to the food processor. Add the Port to the skillet, bring it to a boil, and deglaze the skillet, scraping up the brown bits, for 1 minute. Add the Port to the food processor with the remaining 4 tablespoons butter, softened, the allspice, the lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste, purée the mixture until it is smooth, and force it through a fine sieve into a bowl. Line an oiled 1 1/2-quart terrine or straight-sided dish with plastic wrap and pour the pâté, covered, for 5 hours, or until it is firm. The pâté may be made 4 days in advance and kept covered and chilled. Invert the pâté onto a plate, discarding the plastic wrap, and smooth the top and sides. Spread the preserves on the top and serve the pâté with the toast points or water biscuits.
