Cook bacon in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels using slotted spoon and drain. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons drippings from skillet. Add cabbage and sauté 3 minutes. Whisk 3 tablespoons vinegar, sugar and caraway in small bowl. Add to cabbage and sauté until cabbage is wilted but still crisp-tender, about 5 minutes more. Season generously with salt and pepper. Taste, adding more vinegar if desired. Mix bacon into cabbage. Transfer to bowl. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.
