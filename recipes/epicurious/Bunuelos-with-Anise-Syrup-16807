Combine all ingredients in heavy large saucepan. Stir over medium heat until piloncillo cones dissolve, about 5 minutes. Increase heat and boil until syrup thickens enough to coat spoon thinly, about 20 minutes. Strain syrup into bowl. (Syrup can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm before using.) Combine 3/4 cup water, 3/4 cup juice, 1 egg, 3 tablespoons sugar, 3 tablespoons lard, 1 tablespoon rum, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in large bowl; whisk to blend well. Gradually add 5 cups flour, stirring until soft, slightly sticky dough forms. Add more flour by tablespoonfuls if dough is very sticky. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rest 1 hour. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half. Divide each half into 8 equal pieces. Shape each piece into round ball. Roll out each piece to 6-inch round. Let dough rounds rest 15 minutes. Pour enough vegetable oil into heavy large pot to reach depth of 1 inch. Attach deep-fry thermometer and heat oil to 365°F to 370°F. Fry dough rounds, 2 at a time, until golden and puffed, turning rounds occasionally with tongs, about 2 minutes. Transfer buñuelos to paper towels to drain. Arrange buñuelos on platter. Drizzle generously with warm syrup. Serve, passing remaining syrup separately. *Mexican raw sugar shaped into hard cones. Smaller chunks are sometimes labled panocha. If neither is available, substitute an equal weight of packed dark brown sugar.
