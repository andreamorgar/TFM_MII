Heat oil in large pot over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and sauté until tender, about 10 minutes. Add canned tomatoes with juices. Cook until liquid thickens slightly, about 15 minutes. Season mushroom mixture with salt and pepper. Heat large skillet over high heat. Add 1 tortilla to skillet and cook until pliable, about 15 seconds per side. Place on work surface. Spoon 1/6 of mushroom mixture in strip on lower half, leaving 2-inch border at sides. Top with 1/4 cup cheese, 2 tablespoons onions, 2 tablespoons cilantro, 1/6 of peppers and tomatoes, then 1/2 cup spinach leaves. Fold in sides of tortilla over filling; fold up bottom and continue to roll up, enclosing filling. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
