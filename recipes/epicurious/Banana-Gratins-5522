Preheat broiler. Divide bananas among gratin dishes. Stir together sour cream and vanilla in a bowl, then spoon over bananas, covering them and smoothing tops. Sprinkle each gratin with 1 tablespoon sugar and broil on a baking sheet 3 to 5 inches from heat until sugar is melted but not caramelized, about 3 minutes.
