Chop tomatoes and bell pepper. In a medium saucepan bring vinegars to a boil with sugar, salt, mustard seeds, black pepper, and red pepper flakes, stirring occasionally, and stir in tomatoes, bell pepper, and scallions. Simmer mixture, uncovered, stirring occasionally (stir more frequently toward end of cooking), about 1 1/4 hours, or until thickened and reduced to about 1 1/2 cups. Cool chutney completely. Chutney keeps, covered and chilled, 2 weeks.
