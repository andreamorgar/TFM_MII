Pit apricots and coarsely chop. In a 2-quart heavy saucepan cook apricots and sugar over moderate heat, stirring, until sugar is dissolved. Cook mixture, stirring occasionally, until apricots are softened, about 5 minutes, and cool. Chill mixture, covered, until cold and up to 2 days. In a blender blend cream cheese and milk until smooth. Using a long-handled spoon stir in heavy cream, lemon juice, and apricot mixture (do not blend). Freeze mixture in an ice-cream maker. Transfer ice cream to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden.
