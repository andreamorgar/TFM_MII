Preheat oven to 450°F. Spray nine 1/3-cup muffin cups with nonstick spray. Whisk milk, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon and salt in medium bowl to blend. Add flour and whisk until smooth. Divide batter among prepared muffin cups (about 3 tablespoons batter per cup). Bake popovers 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F. Continue to bake until popovers are brown and crisp, about 20 minutes. Turn popovers out of pan, loosening with small sharp knife if necessary. Sift powdered sugar over and serve immediately.
