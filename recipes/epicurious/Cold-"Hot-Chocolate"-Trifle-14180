In a bowl, beat egg whites and a pinch of salt until soft peaks form. Add 1/4 cup sugar; beat until stiff peaks of meringue form. In a microwave-safe bowl, nuke chocolate in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until melted; let cool slightly. Gently fold chocolate into meringue until just combined. Divide mousse evenly among four 5-ounces glasses. Rinse bowl; add cream and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar; beat until soft peaks form. Top mousse with whipped cream, crushed cookies and marshmallows. Refrigerate at least 2 hours or up to 24.
