Place lamb, 4 cups water, onion, carrot, bunch of dill, peppercorns, and salt in heavy large pot. Bring to boil over medium-high heat, skimming off foam. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until meat is tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 1/2 hours. Strain broth into medium saucepan. Boil until reduced to 21/3 cups, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, remove lamb from vegetables; discard vegetables. Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and whisk 1 minute. Whisk in 2 1/3 cups reduced broth. Cook until sauce thickens and boils, whisking occasionally, about 6 minutes. Whisk in white wine vinegar, sugar and 1/4 cup chopped fresh dill. Simmer 3 minutes to blend flavors. Stir in cream and lamb and simmer until heated through, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to serving bowl.
