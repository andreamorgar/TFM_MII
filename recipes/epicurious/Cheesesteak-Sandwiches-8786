Preheat broiler. Cook onions in butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until pale golden, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in beef, water, and salt and pepper to taste and cook, stirring, until heated through, about 1 minute. Halve bread horizontally without cutting all the way through and open cut sides, then put bread in a shallow baking pan. Divide beef mixture evenly among bread and top with cheese. Broil 6 inches from heat until cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes.
