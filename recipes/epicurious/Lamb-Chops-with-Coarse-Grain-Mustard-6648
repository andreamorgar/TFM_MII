Prepare grill for cooking or heat a well-seasoned ridged grill pan (preferably cast-iron) over moderately high heat until hot. Pat chops dry and season with salt and pepper. Grill until undersides are browned, about 3 minutes, then turn over and spread browned sides with mustard. Grill about 4 minutes more for medium-rare.
