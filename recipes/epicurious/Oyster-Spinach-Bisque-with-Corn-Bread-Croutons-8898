Drain oysters in a fine sieve set over a glass measure, adding enough water to liquor to measure 1 cup, and reserve liquid. Rinse oysters under cold water and drain. Transfer oysters to a bowl and chill, covered. In a large saucepan melt butter over moderate heat until foam subsides and cook shallots, stirring, until softened. Add Sherry and cook until almost all liquid is evaporated. Stir in reserved oyster liquid and 1 1/2 cups milk and bring barely to a simmer (do not let boil). Stir in 12 oysters and poach until edges begin to curl, about 2 minutes. (Liquid may separate but will come together once blended.) In a blender purée mixture in batches until smooth and strain into a kettle, skimming froth. Stir in remaining 1 1/2 cups milk and cream and bring barely to a simmer (do not let boil). Stir in remaining 24 oysters, spinach, and salt and pepper to taste and poach oysters until edges begin to curl, about 2 minutes. Ladle bisque into 8 heated soup plates and garnish with spinach leaves and bell pepper. Serve bisque with croutons.
