Preheat broiler. Pierce eggplants all over with fork. Place on baking sheet. Broil until skin is crisp and flesh is soft, turning frequently, about 25 minutes. Place eggplants on rack set over rimmed baking sheet. Cool completely (liquid will drain from eggplants as they cool). Using small knife, peel skin from eggplants. Coarsely chop eggplants; place in large bowl. Add tomatoes, onion and garlic. Using electric mixer, beat 1 minute. Add yogurt; beat 1 minute. Reduce speed to low. Add vinegar and lemon juice; beat to blend. Gradually beat in oil. Mix in parsley and oregano. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight. (Can be made 2 days ahead.) Serve with pita bread.
