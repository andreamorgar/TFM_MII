Place the crabmeat in a bowl, breaking it up as little as possible. In a separate bowl, combine the onion, bell pepper, mayonnaise, mustard, capers, egg, horseradish, salt, pepper, and seafood seasoning. Mix well, add the crabmeat, and fold together, again, taking care not to break up the crabmeat. Shape the crabcakes. If you wish, you can roughly shape them by hand before placing the mixture in metal rings or round cookie cutters, each about 2 1/2 inches in diameter. Or you can place the rings on a flat surface, put 2 1/2 to 3 ounces of the mixture in each ring, and press lightly on each cake. Preheat a nonstick pan or a seasoned cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the butter, but don't let it smoke. Using your finger and a small spatula, guide about four of the rings into the skillet. Cook the crabcakes for 1 1/2 minutes, or until golden brown. Turn them over, using the spatula, and cook again for 1 1/2 minutes or until golden brown. Using the spatula, move the cakes to a sheet pan, and remove the rings. Repeat until the entire mixture is used. About halfway through, discard the butter and use a second tablespoonful. To make the corn accompaniment: Place a sauté pan over medium heat, and add 1/2 tablespoon of butter. Be careful not to let the butter burn. Place the corn and jalapeño in the pan, and stir constantly, seasoning with salt and pepper. When the corn is hot (1 1/2 to 2 minutes), stir in the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter and add the minced thyme. Cook until all the butter has melted. Season to taste. Serve one crabcake for an appetizer portion, two for an entrée. Spoon some of the corn mixture over the top of each cake, sprinkle with green onions, and garnish, if desired, with thyme springs.
