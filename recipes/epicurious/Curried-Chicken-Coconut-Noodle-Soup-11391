In a heavy saucepan cook the garlic in the vegetable oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until it is fragrant, add the curry powder, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 30 seconds. Stir in the broth, the coconut milk, the water, the lemongrass, the gingerroot, and the peppercorns and bring the mixture to a boil. Add the chicken and poach it at a bare simmer for 20 minutes, or until it is cooked through. Transfer the chicken with a slotted spoon to a bowl and let it cool, keeping the poaching mixture warm. While the chicken is cooling, in a large bowl soak the noodles in warm water to cover for 5 minutes, drain them, and in a large saucepan of salted boiling water cook them for 5 minutes. Drain the noodles in a colander, rinse them under cold water, and drain them well. Discard the skin and bones from the chicken, shred the meat, and stir it into the poaching mixture with the lime juice and the fish sauce. Cook the soup over moderate heat, stirring, until it is hot, divide the noodles among 6 to 8 bowls, and ladle the soup over them. Sprinkle the soup with the coriander and drizzle it with the chili oil.
