Place mushrooms in small bowl. Add 1 1/2 cups hot water; let stand 30 minutes to soften. Remove mushrooms from soaking liquid, squeezing mushrooms to release liquid into same bowl. Reserve liquid. Chop mushrooms. Heat oil in heavy large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; sauté until tender, about 8 minutes. Add rosemary and red pepper and sauté 1 minute. Add tomatoes, tomato paste and mushrooms. Pour in mushroom soaking liquid, leaving any sediment in bottom of bowl. Bring sauce to boil, stirring often. Reduce heat; simmer until thick, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover; chill. Before using, rewarm over medium heat, stirring occasionally.) Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat) or preheat broiler. Grill sausages until just cooked through, turning occasionally, about 12 minutes.
