Heat vegetable oil in heavy large skillet over medium-low heat. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Add chicken to skillet and sauté until no longer pink, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes, hominy and chili powder and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered until chicken is cooked through and sauce is slightly thickened, breaking up tomatoes with back of spoon, about 8 minutes. Mix in cilantro. Season ragout to taste with salt and pepper and serve.
