Add 2 tablespoons butter and saffron threads to broth and bring to boil. Remove from heat. Add couscous; stir to blend. Cover tightly and let stand until liquid is absorbed and couscous is tender, about 5 minutes. Fluff couscous with fork. Gently mix in chives and peas. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
