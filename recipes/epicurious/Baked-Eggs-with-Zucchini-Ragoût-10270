Heat oil in large nonstick ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add onions and garlic; sauté 5 minutes. Add zucchini; cover and cook until tender, stirring often, about 10 minutes. Add tomatoes with juices and red pepper; boil uncovered until mixture thickens, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in basil. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover; let stand at room temperature.) Preheat oven to 400°F. Make 4 shallow indentations in ragout, spacing apart. Crack 1 egg into each indentation. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake until eggs are softly set, about 10 minutes. Place 1 toast slice on each of 4 plates. Divide egg-topped ragout on top of toast.
