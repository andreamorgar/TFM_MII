Preheat the oven to 375°F. Season lamb with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spread the pesto over the surface of the meat. Coat the meat thoroughly with breadcrumbs, packing them down lightly with your hands. Cover the exposed bones with aluminum foil and place lamb, breadcrumb side up, on a baking sheet. Roast lamb for 15 minutes, then remove foil and bake 20 minutes longer. Remove lamb from oven, let it rest for 5 minutes, then dust lightly with salt. Slice into thick double chops or single chops. Serve immediately.
