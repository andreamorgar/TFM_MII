Cook bacon in a cast-iron or other large heavy skillet over medium heat until fat is rendered and bacon is crisp, about 12 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Pour drippings into a small bowl; return 6 tablespoons to the same skillet set over medium heat. Whisk flour into drippings, reduce heat to low, and cook, whisking constantly, until roux is one shade darker than peanut butter, about 10 minutes. Add onion, pepper, celery, jalapeños, and garlic; cook, stirring frequently, until onion is soft, about 20 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high; stir in reserved bacon, spice mix, then broth. Simmer, stirring often, until thickened and flavors meld, 20-25 minutes. Stir in crawfish. Simmer until the tails curl, about 3 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne, if desired. Garnish with scallions.
