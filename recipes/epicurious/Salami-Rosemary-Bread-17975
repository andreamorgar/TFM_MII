In a small bowl proof the yeast in 1 cup of the water for 5 minutes, or until the mixture is foamy, and in another small bowl dissolve the table salt in the remaining 1 cup water. In a large bowl stir together the yeast mixture, the salt water, and 4 cups of the flour until a dough is formed, turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and knead in the salami, the rosemary, and enough of the remaining 2 cups flour to form a slightly sticky dough. Knead the dough for 10 minutes, form it into a ball, and transfer it to a lightly oiled bowl, turning it to coat it with the oil. Let the dough rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place for 1 hour, or until it is double in bulk, knead it for 30 seconds, and form it into a 16-inch-long loaf. Transfer the loaf to a lightly oiled baking sheet and let it rise, uncovered, in a warm place for 1 hour, or until it is double in bulk. Make four 1/4-inch-deep slashes in the top of the loaf and brush the loaf with the glaze. Sprinkle the loaf with the coarse salt and bake it in the middle of a preheated 425°F. oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350°F. and bake the loaf for 30 minutes more, or until it sounds hollow when the bottom is tapped. Transfer the loaf to a rack and let it cool.
