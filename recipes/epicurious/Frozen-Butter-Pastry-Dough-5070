Into a chilled large metal bowl sift together flour and salt. Set grater in flour bowl and coarsely grate frozen butter into flour, gently lifting and tossing flour to coat butter. Chill mixture 20 minutes. Drizzle 6 tablespoons ice water evenly over mixture and gently stir with a fork until just incorporated. Gently squeeze a small handful of mixture to test for proper texture: It should hold together without crumbling apart. If necessary, add some additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time and stirring until just incorporated, and test mixture again. (If you overwork or add too much water, pastry will be tough.) Turn mixture out onto a lightly floured surface and with floured hands mound into 4 portions. With heel of hand smear each portion once in a forward motion to help distribute fat. Gather dough portions together and form dough, rotating it on work surface, into a disk (dough will not be smooth). Chill dough, wrapped in plastic wrap, at least 2 hours, or until firm, and up to 2 days.
