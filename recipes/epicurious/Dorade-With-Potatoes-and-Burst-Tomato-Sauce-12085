Preheat oven to 350°F. Toast pine nuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Let cool. Toss tomatoes and 1 Tbsp. oil on another baking sheet; season with salt. Roast until softened, 25–30 minutes; let cool slightly. Meanwhile, place raisins in a medium bowl and pour in boiling water to cover. Let sit until plump and softened, 8–10 minutes. Drain and return to bowl. Add pine nuts, garlic, mint, capers, vinegar, red pepper flakes, and remaining 2 Tbsp. oil to raisins and mix well. Gently mix in tomatoes; season with salt. Increase oven temperature to 425°F. Cook potatoes in a pot of boiling salted water until fork-tender, 15–18 minutes. Drain; let cool, then slice lengthwise 1/4" thick. Toss potatoes with lemon, mint sprigs, garlic, bay leaves, and 1/4 cup oil in a shallow 3-qt. baking dish; season with salt and pepper. Pour wine over. Season fillets with salt and pepper. Place, skin side up, on top of potato mixture and drizzle with remaining 2 Tbsp. oil. Roast until fillets are cooked through, 12–18 minutes. Transfer fillets to a platter, placing skin side up, and tent with foil to keep warm. Continue to roast potatoes until edges are browned, 10–15 minutes. Serve dorade with tomato sauce and potatoes.
