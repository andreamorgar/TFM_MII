Combine 1/2 cup plus 1 Tbsp. all-purpose flour and 1/4 cup semolina flour in a large bowl. Add oil and 1/4 cup warm water and mix with a fork until a stiff dough forms. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 8–10 minutes. Wrap tightly in plastic; let sit at room temperature 1 hour. Cut dough in half. Working with a piece at a time and keeping remaining dough wrapped in plastic, roll dough into a 9x3/4" log. Cut on a diagonal into 1/2" pieces; dust with all-purpose flour. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, roll out between your palms to make about 3" strands that taper at the ends. Dust pasta with semolina flour and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover with a kitchen towel until ready to use. Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high. Add sausage and cook, breaking into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until softened, about 1 minute. Add clams and wine; cover. Cook, shaking skillet occasionally, until clams open, about 5 minutes; discard any that do not open. Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente, about 3 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup pasta cooking liquid. Add butter, parsley, pasta, and 1/2 cup pasta cooking liquid to clams. Cook, tossing and adding more cooking liquid as needed, until sauce coats pasta, about 3 minutes. Taste and season with salt.
