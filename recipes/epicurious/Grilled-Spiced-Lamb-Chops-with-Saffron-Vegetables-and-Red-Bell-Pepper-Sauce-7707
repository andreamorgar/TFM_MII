Whisk first 6 ingredients in medium bowl. Place chops on large rimmed baking sheet. Pour marinade over, turning to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours. Melt butter with oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add shallots, leeks, saffron, and turmeric; sauté 5 minutes. Add 1 1/2 cups water, turnips, carrots, and rutabagas. Cover and simmer until vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes. Season generously with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, prepare barbecue (medium heat). Brush grill with oil. Remove lamb from marinade, scraping off some of excess marinade. Sprinkle lamb with salt and pepper. Grill to desired doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium-rare. Divide grilled lamb chops among 6 plates. Serve with saffron vegetables and Red Bell Pepper Sauce.
