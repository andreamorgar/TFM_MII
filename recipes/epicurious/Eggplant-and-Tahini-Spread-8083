Prepare grill for cooking. Grill eggplants on a rack set 4 inches over glowing coals, turning every 10 minutes, until charred all over and very soft, 20 to 35 minutes. (Or broil in a shallow baking pan about 6 inches from heat, turning occasionally.) Cool eggplants. Discard charred skins and tough stem ends and purée eggplants in a blender with tahini, garlic paste, lemon juice, cumin, and salt until combined well. Season with more salt if necessary. Transfer to a plate or bowl, then drizzle with oil and sprinkle with parsley.
