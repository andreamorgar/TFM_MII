In a food processor, combine all the ingredients, and pulse until smooth. Refrigerate until needed; this keeps for 1 month. Makes about 1 cup. This is the marinade we use on the Tamarind Barbecued Duck with Smoky Plantain Crema . Combine 1 1/4 cups Sugarcane Marinade with 1/2 cup tamarind pulp in a small pot and heat over medium-low heat, stirring to dissolve the tamarind. When the mixture just begins to simmer, remove from the heat and pass through a coarse strainer. Let cool.
