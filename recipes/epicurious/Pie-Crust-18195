Combine first 3 ingredients in heavy-duty stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment. Blend on low speed. Add butter; mix on low speed until mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup ice water; mix until dough clings to paddle, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry. Gather dough together. For two 12-inch round crusts, divide dough in half; flatten each into disk. Roll out each dough disk on floured surface to 12-inch round. For two 14x10-inch oval crusts, divide dough in half; flatten each into oval. Roll out each on floured surface to 14x10-inch oval. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 weeks ahead. Wrap each crust in plastic, then foil, and freeze. Thaw in refrigerator overnight before using.
