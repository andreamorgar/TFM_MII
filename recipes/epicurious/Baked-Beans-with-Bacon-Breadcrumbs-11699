Preheat oven to 350°F. Heat oil in a large heavy wide pot over high heat; add ham, onion, and garlic. Cook, stirring often, until onion caramelizes, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Add ketchup, next 6 ingredients, and 4 cups water to pot; season to taste with salt and pepper. Let sauce simmer until slightly thickened, 10-15 minutes. Stir beans into sauce. Cover and bake beans until juices are bubbly and thickened, about 2 hours. Meanwhile, place bacon slices on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast in oven until crisp, 10-15 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Let bacon cool and reserve 1 tablespoon bacon drippings separately. Coarsely crumble bacon; place in a food processor with reserved drippings and panko; pulse until bacon is finely chopped. Season with salt and pepper. Remove beans from oven. Preheat broiler. Sprinkle beans with bacon breadcrumbs. Broil, uncovered, until crumbs are golden brown, 8-10 minutes.
