Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over high heat. Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper; sprinkle chicken on all sides with flour. Add chicken and pearl onions to skillet and sauté until chicken is golden, about 3 minutes per side. Add 1 cup canned low-salt chicken broth, 1/3 cup white wine, 4 bay leaves and 1 tablespoon dried thyme. Bring liquid to boil. Reduce heat to medium low, cover and simmer until chicken and onions are cooked through, about 25 minutes. Uncover and simmer until sauce thickens, about 8 minutes. Transfer chicken and onions to plates. Season sauce with salt and pepper; spoon over chicken.
