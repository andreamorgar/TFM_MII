Mince garlic and in a bowl stir together with mustard and lime juice. Trim steak if necessary. Rub steak with mustard mixture and marinate 15 minutes. Heat a well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat until just smoking and grill steak 3 minutes on each side. (Alternatively, broil steak on rack of a broiler pan about 4 inches from heat.) Transfer steak to a platter and let stand, uncovered, 5 minutes. With a sharp knife diagonally cut steak into 1/3-inch-thick slices and serve with coleslaw and fries.
