Fry bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crisp. Transfer to a paper-towel lined plate to drain. Reduce heat to medium and cook tomatoes, cut side down, in same skillet, adding oil if needed and turning once, until tomatoes are browned and tender, 2–4 minutes on each side. Transfer tomatoes to a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper. Fry eggs in batches in same skillet, adding more oil if needed, until whites are set but yolks are still runny. Layer 2 bacon slices, 2 tomato halves, and 1 egg on each toast, season with salt and pepper, and serve.
