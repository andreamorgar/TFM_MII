Preheat oven to 350°F. Sift together flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Mix together butter and egg in a blender. Add milk, pepper, and flour mixture and blend just until smooth. Drop 6 scant tablespoons batter about 5 inches apart onto a buttered baking sheet. Spread each dollop of batter with back of a spoon into a 5-inch round. Bake 1 sheet of wafers in middle of oven until golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes, then transfer wafers to a rack to cool. Form 6 more wafers on second sheet while first is baking, then continue to make wafers, 1 sheet at a time. (Sheets should be cooled but not cleaned between batches.)
