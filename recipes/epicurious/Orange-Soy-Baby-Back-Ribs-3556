Put ribs in a large sealable plastic bag. Stir together orange juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, and cumin in a bowl until sugar is dissolved, then pour marinade over ribs in bag and seal bag, pressing out excess air. Marinate ribs, chilled, turning bag over after 30 minutes, 1 hour total. Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375°F. Transfer ribs and marinade to baking dish and arrange ribs in 1 layer, not touching. Roast ribs 30 minutes, then turn over ribs with tongs and continue roasting until they are tender and well browned and marinade is thick and syrupy, about 30 minutes more.
