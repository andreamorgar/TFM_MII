Cook 1/2 pound spaghetti; drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking liquid. Meanwhile, heat 4 tablespoons unsalted butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook 2 anchovy fillets and 4 sliced garlic cloves, stirring often, until anchovies are broken down and garlic is soft, about 4 minutes. Add 2 pounds quartered medium tomatoes; season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until falling apart, 8–10 minutes. Toss in pasta and cooking liquid; cook until sauce coats pasta, about 2 minutes. Toss in chopped tender herbs (such as flat-leaf parsley, tarragon, and/or chives).
