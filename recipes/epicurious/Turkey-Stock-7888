Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add turkey parts and sauté until brown, about 15 minutes. Add onions, carrots, celery, garlic, thyme, and bay leaves; sauté until brown, about 12 minutes. Add broth and Madeira and bring to boil. Reduce heat; partially cover pot and simmer until liquid is reduced to 6 cups, about 1 hour. Cool stock 1 hour; strain into bowl, pressing on solids in strainer to release all liquid. Spoon off any fat. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
