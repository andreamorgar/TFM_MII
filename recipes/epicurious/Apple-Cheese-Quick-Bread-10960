In a large bowl cream together the butter and the sugar and beat in the honey and the eggs. Into the butter mixture sift together the flours, the baking powder, the baking soda, and the salt, stir the mixture until it is combined well, and stir in the apples, the cheese, and the walnuts. Spoon the batter into a buttered loaf pan, 9 by 5 by 3 inches, and bake it in the middle of a preheated 350°F. oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Turn the bread out onto a rack, and let if cool completely, and serve it sliced with the cream cheese.
