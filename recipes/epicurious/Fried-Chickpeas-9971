Combine paprika and cayenne in a small bowl and set aside. Heat oil in a 12" skillet over medium-high heat. Working in 2 batches, add chickpeas to skillet and sauté, stirring frequently, until golden and crispy, 15-20 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer chickpeas to paper towels to drain briefly. Place in a medium bowl. Sprinkle paprika mixture over; toss to coat. Season to taste with salt. Toss with lime zest and serve.
