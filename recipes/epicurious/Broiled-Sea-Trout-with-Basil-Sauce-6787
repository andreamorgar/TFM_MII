Preheat broiler. Finely chop basil, parsley, and garlic together in a blender. Add 3 tablespoons oil and purée, then blend in water, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. If desired, thin with more water. Arrange fillets, skin sides down, in an oiled shallow (1-inch-deep) baking pan. Brush fish with remaining tablespoon oil and season with salt and pepper. Broil 5 to 6 inches from heat until just cooked through, about 7 minutes. Serve fish with sauce.
