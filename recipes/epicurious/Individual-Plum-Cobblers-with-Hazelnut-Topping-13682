Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter eight 2/3-cup soufflé dishes or custard cups. Combine plums, sugar, tapioca and cinnamon in large bowl; toss to blend. Let stand 15 minutes, tossing occasionally. Divide among prepared dishes (dishes will be full). Place on baking sheet. Dot fruit with butter. Bake until plums are tender and fruit bubbles thickly, about 45 minutes. Cool in dishes. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.) Preheat oven to 375°F. Whisk together flour, golden brown sugar, baking powder and salt in medium bowl. Add butter, rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal. Mix in nuts. Gradually add cream, stirring with fork until batter holds together. Drop large spoonful of batter atop fruit in each dish, dividing equally. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake until topping is golden, about 25 minutes. Cool at least 15 minutes. Top with ice cream; serve warm.
