Combine tomatoes, onions, peppers, and 1/4 cup coarse kosher salt in large glass bowl. Stir to mix. Cover and let stand in cool place at least 12 hours and up to 1 day, stirring occasionally. Drain tomato mixture in large colander. Rinse with cold water; let drain well, at least 30 minutes. Using hands, squeeze any excess liquid from tomato mixture. Combine tomato mixture, 1 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt, and next 5 ingredients in large pot. Stir over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until almost all liquid evaporates, stirring frequently, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Ladle mixture into 6 hot clean 1/2-pint glass canning jars, leaving 1/2-inch space at top of jars. Remove air bubbles. Wipe jar threads and rims with clean damp cloth. Cover with hot lids; apply screw bands. Process jars in pot of boiling water 10 minutes. Cool jars completely. Store in cool dark place up to 1 year.
