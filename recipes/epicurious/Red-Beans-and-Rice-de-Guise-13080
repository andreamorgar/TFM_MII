Place beans in large bowl with enough cold water to cover by 3 inches. Let stand overnight. Drain beans. Place dried mushrooms in bowl and pour 1 1/2 cups boiling water over. Soak until softened, about 15 minutes. Transfer mushrooms to bowl using slotted spoon. Strain soaking liquid through sieve lined with paper towel; reserve. Thinly slice mushrooms. Heat oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add onion, celery, bell pepper, garlic, 1/4 cup parsley, tarragon, rosemary and bay leaves. Cook until vegetables are translucent, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Add button mushrooms and sauté 3 minutes. Mix in kidney beans, porcini mushrooms, reserved mushroom soaking liquid, broth, 4 cups water and ham hocks. Bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover partially and simmer 1 hour. Meanwhile, melt 3 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add sausage and cook through, turning frequently, about 10 minutes. Transfer sausage to paper towels using tongs and drain. Cut into 1-inch-thick slices. Add sausage to bean mixture in pot. Simmer uncovered until beans are very tender, stirring frequently, about 45 minutes. Season with hot pepper sauce and cayenne. Remove ham hocks. Discard bones. Cut meat into bite-size pieces and return to pot. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to simmer before serving.) Spoon rice into bowls. Ladle beans over. Garnish with chives and parsley.
