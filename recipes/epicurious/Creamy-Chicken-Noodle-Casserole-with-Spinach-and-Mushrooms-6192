Shred chicken. Pour cooking liquid into measuring cup, adding more water to measure 1 cup if necessary. Reserve cooking liquid. Whisk flour and cornstarch in heavy large saucepan. Add 1 cup milk; whisk until smooth. Stir in 1 cup milk, tarragon, salt, nutmeg and reserved 1 cup chicken cooking liquid. Stir over medium heat until mixture thickens and boils, about 5 minutes. Add wine; stir until mixture is very thick, about 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat. Stir in shredded chicken and spinach. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, before continuing.) Preheat oven to 400°F. Oil 11 x 7 x 2-inch glass baking dish.
