Preheat oven to 350°F. Shape dough pieces into balls. Arrange on baking sheet and flatten to 1/2-inch thickness; press nuts onto each. Bake until golden, 12 to 18 minutes, depending on brand of cookie. Cool completely on sheet. Meanwhile, mix ice cream, fresh mint, and extract in small bowl; place in freezer until ready to use. Line baking sheet with foil. Place 1/4 cup ice cream on flat side of 1 cookie. Top with flat side of second cookie. Place on prepared sheet and freeze. Repeat to form 7 more sandwiches. Freeze until ice cream begins to firm, about 10 minutes. Melt chocolate chips in microwave-safe bowl on low setting in 15-second intervals, stirring often. Dip sandwiches halfway into chocolate. Return to sheet. Freeze at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day.
