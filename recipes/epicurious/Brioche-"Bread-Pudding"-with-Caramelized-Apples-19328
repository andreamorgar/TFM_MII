In a small saucepan, combine 3 tablespoons water and the sugar. Stirring until sugar dissolves, bring mixture to a simmer. Let syrup simmer one minute. Remove from heat and let cool. Heat oven to 350°F. In a medium bowl, toss nuts with 1/4 cup simple syrup to coat. Add sugar, toss well, and spread evenly over cookie sheet. Bake 10 minutes, stirring after 5. With spatula, loosen nuts from sheet. Transfer sheet to wire rack to cool completely. Heat a 12-inch skillet over medium high heat. Add sugar, vanilla bean seeds, and empty pods. When sugar begins to melt and turn golden brown, whisk in butter and add apples. Simmer apples in caramel for about 5 minutes. Add cider and raisins. Simmer 5 minutes, until juices are slightly thickened. Let apples cool in pan. Remove vanilla pods before serving. Using a 3-inch round cookie cutter, cut a circle from each brioche slice. In a 9-inch square baking dish whisk together the cream, milk, yolk, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cardamom. Dip brioche in the custard; let soak for 15-30 seconds on each side. In a large nonstick skillet over medium high heat melt 1 tablespoon of the butter. Cook 4 brioche slices about 3 minutes, until golden brown, turning once. Repeat with remaining butter and brioche. Place one slice brioche on each plate. Divide compote among brioche slices. Dollop 2 tablespoons crème fraîche on each slice. Top each serving with candied nuts.
