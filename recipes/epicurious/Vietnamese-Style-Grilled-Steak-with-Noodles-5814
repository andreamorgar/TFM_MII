In a kettle of boiling salted water boil the capellini until it is just tender and drain it in a colander. Rinse the capellini under cold water and drain it well. While the noodles are boiling, in a blender blend the vinegar, 1 tablespoon water, the soy sauce, the garlic, the sugar, the red pepper flakes, the salt, and the anchovy paste until the sauce is smooth. In a bowl toss the noodles with the sauce and the shredded mint. Heat a well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat until it is hot and in it grill the steaks, patted dry and seasoned with salt and pepper, for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until they are springy to the touch, for medium-rare meat. (Alternatively the steaks may be grilled on an oiled rack set 4 to 5 inches over glowing coals for the same amount of time.) Transfer the steaks to a cutting board and let them stand for 5 minutes. Cut the steaks into thin slices. Divide the noodles between 2 plates, mounding them, arrange the slices of steak on them, and surround the noodles with the bean sprouts and the bell pepper. Garnish each serving with a mint sprig.
