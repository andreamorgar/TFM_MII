Combine pears, wine and lemon juice in heavy large Dutch oven. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer until pears are tender, occasionally stirring and pushing pears into liquid to submerge, about 20 minutes. Working in batches, transfer mixture to processor; puree. Return to same pot. Add sugar, cinnamon and cardamom. Simmer over low heat until mixture thickens and mounds slightly on spoon, stirring often and partially covering if mixture splatters, about 2 hours. Transfer hot pear butter to clean jars. Cover and cool. Refrigerate. (Can be made 2 weeks ahead. Keep refrigerated.)
