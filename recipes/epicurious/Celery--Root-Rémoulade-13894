Whisk together 1/4 cup buttermilk, cornstarch, salt, and cayenne in a small heavy saucepan until smooth. Whisk in yolk, then remaining 1/2cup buttermilk. Cook over moderately low heat, whisking constantly, until mixture comes to a simmer and thickens, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl. Whisk in oil, herbs, anchovy, cornichon, capers, shallot, mustard, sugar, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Chill rémoulade, covered, at least 30 minutes. Whisk water into rémoulade to thin and toss with celery root.
