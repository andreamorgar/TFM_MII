Pour syrup into a 1-quart heavy saucepan, setting aside cherries. Whisk sugar, wine, and cornstarch into cherry syrup until smooth, then bring to a boil over moderate heat, whisking constantly, and boil until slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Remove from heat, then stir in almond extract and cherries and cool. *Available at specialty shops.
