Rinse chicken and pat dry with paper towels. In a small bowl combine chicken and lemon juice and marinate, turning once, 10 minutes. On a sheet of wax paper combine flour, fennel seeds, and salt and pepper to taste. Remove chicken from bowl, letting excess lemon juice drip into bowl, and reserve lemon juice. Dredge chicken in flour mixture, shaking off excess. In a 10-inch non-stick skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté chicken about 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Turn chicken and cook over moderate heat 5 minutes more, or until opaque and cooked through. Transfer chicken to a cutting board. To skillet add roasted pepper strips and reserved lemon juice and simmer until most of liquid is evaporated, about 2 minutes. Slice chicken thin. Make sandwiches on rolls with arugula, chicken, and roasted pepper strips.
