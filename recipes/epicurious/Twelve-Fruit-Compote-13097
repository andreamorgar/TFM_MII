Combine 3 cups water and sugar in heavy large saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Add mixed dried fruits, white wine, orange, lemon, raisins, dried cherries, cloves and cinnamon sticks. Simmer compote until fruits are tender and liquid is reduced to syrup, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Mix in grapes. Cool compote to room temperature; cover tightly and refrigerate. (Can be prepared up to 3 days ahead. Keep refrigerated.) Spoon compote into stemmed goblets and serve.
