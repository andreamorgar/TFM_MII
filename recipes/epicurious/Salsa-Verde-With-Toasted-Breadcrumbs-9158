Preheat oven to 300°F. Bake bread on a rimmed baking sheet 5 minutes to dry out. Let cool. Heat 1/4 cup oil in a medium skillet over medium. Add bread and cook, tossing and shaking pan often, until golden and crisp, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer croutons to paper towels to drain; season with salt and let cool. Transfer croutons to a medium bowl and crush using your hands or a metal spoon until finely ground. Set aside. Using the side of a chef’s knife, mash anchovies, garlic, and capers to a paste on a cutting board. Transfer anchovy mixture to a medium bowl. Add vinegar and let sit 10 minutes. Stir in parsley and remaining 3/4 cup oil. To serve, mix breadcrumbs into salsa verde; season with salt and pepper. Breadcrumbs can be made 1 day ahead; store airtight at room temperature. Salsa verde (without breadcrumbs) can be made 4 hours ahead; cover and chill.
