Trim fennel stalks flush with bulbs and discard stalks. Quarter bulbs lengthwise and cut out most of cores, leaving enough to keep pieces intact. Cut quarters lengthwise into thin slices. Toast mustard seeds in a dry small heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until mustard seeds begin to pop and turn 1 shade darker, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool. Whisk together vinegar, Dijon mustard, and salt and pepper to taste, then add oil in a slow stream, whisking until emulsified. Stir in shallot and mustard seeds. Toss together fennel, romaine, frisée, endives, and parsley in a large bowl. Serve with dressing on side.
