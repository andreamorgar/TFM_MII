Soften gelatin in 1 tablespoon cold water. In small saucepan, heat sugar and half and half until sugar dissolves. Whisk in softened gelatin (from above) and vanilla extract. In small bowl, whisk matcha with 2 tablespoons of half and half mixture until smooth. Mix in remaining half and half mixture; strain and divide among four 2/3-cup ramekins or custard cups. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until gelatin sets, at least 2 hours. Fill medium bowl with hot water; dip ramekins in hot water for 30 seconds. Invert, shaking gently to release panna cotta. Garnish plates with strawberries.
