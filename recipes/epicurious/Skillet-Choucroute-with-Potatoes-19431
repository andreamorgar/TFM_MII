Cook kielbasa in large skillet over medium-high heat until sausage is beginning to brown and some fat is rendered, about 3 minutes. Add onion and thyme. Cover and cook until onion starts to soften, stirring once, about 2 minutes. Add apple juice, broth and sauerkraut. Mix in potatoes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
