Using vegetable peeler, remove peel (orange part only) from oranges. Set peel aside (reserve oranges for another use). Combine 2 cups water, honey, star anise and cinnamon stick in medium saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring to boil, stirring to dissolve honey. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until liquid is reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in reserved orange peel. Cool syrup. Strain into large bowl; discard solids. (Can be made 1 day ahead; chill.) Using melon baller, scoop out enough fruit from melon to equal 4 cups. Combine melon balls, nectarines and strawberries in large bowl. Add syrup; toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 5 hours and up to 8 hours. Ladle fruit mixture into bowls. Garnish with orange peel strips, if desired.
