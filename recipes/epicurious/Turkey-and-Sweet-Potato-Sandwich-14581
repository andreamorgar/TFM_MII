Heat gravy in a small saucepan until hot, about 2 minutes. Cut sweet potato across into thin 1/4-inch slices. Place slices on a plate, sprinkle with 1 tbsp water, cover loosely with plastic wrap and microwave 6 to 7 minutes or until very soft. Split rolls in half and pour 2 tbsp gravy on each half and sprinkle sage on top. Divide turkey into 4 equal portions and place on the bottom half of rolls. Top with sweet potato slices. Spread cranberry sauce over the top half of rolls and close the sandwiches. Add salt and pepper to taste and serve.
