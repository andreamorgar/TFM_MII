1. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees. 2. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or foil. On each, draw 10 4-inch circles. 3. Mix the sugars and set aside. 4. In a bowl or electric mixer, beat the egg whites until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and salt. Continue to beat, adding 1 tablespoon of sugar at a time and beating well after each addition. This will take about 10 minutes. 5. Add the vanilla and beat at high speed until stiff and glossy. 6. Using a pastry tube fitted with a large plain tip, pipe the meringue in coils starting at the center and continuing to the outside of each circle. 7. Bake about 1 hour, until cream colored and firm. Leave the meringues in the turned-off oven for several hours or overnight without opening the oven door. 8. When ready to serve, carefully peel away the paper or foil.
