In a large shallow baking dish toss the asparagus with the oil, coating it well, and bake it in a preheated 500°F. oven, shaking the dish every 2 minutes, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until it is almost al dente. Sprinkle the asparagus with the shallot and the sesame seeds, bake it for 1 minute, or until it is al dente, and sprinkle it with the lemon juice and salt to taste.
