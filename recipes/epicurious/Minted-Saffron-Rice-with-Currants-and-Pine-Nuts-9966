In a large heavy saucepan heat oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and cook cuminseed, cinnamon stick, and bay leaf, stirring, until mixture is fragrant and cuminseed is several shades darker (be careful not to burn it). Add onion and cook, stirring, until softened. Add rice and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add water, currants, saffron, and salt and bring to a boil, covered. Reduce heat to very low and simmer rice, covered, 20 minutes, or until liquid is absorbed. Let rice stand 5 minutes. Discard cinnamon stick and bay leaf and stir in pine nuts and mint.
