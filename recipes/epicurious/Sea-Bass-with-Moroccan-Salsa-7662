Char peppers over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides, turning frequently with tongs. Transfer peppers to medium bowl. Cover with foil; let stand 10 minutes. Peel, seed and coarsely chop peppers; return to same bowl. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy small skillet over medium heat. Add cumin and cinnamon; stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour oil mixture over peppers. Mix in olives, next 7 ingredients and 2 tablespoons oil. Season salsa with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover; let stand at room temperature, tossing occasionally.) Preheat broiler. Brush fish all over with 2 tablespoons oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Broil until fish is opaque in center, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer fish to plates. Spoon salsa over.
