Heat raspberries, strawberries, and sugar in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until fruit is hot and sugar is dissolved. Purée mixture in a blender (use caution with hot liquids), then force through a large fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, discarding seeds. Let cool to room temperature.
