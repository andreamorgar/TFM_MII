In a small saucepan sprinkle gelatin over water and let stand 1 minute to soften. Halve strawberries and slice enough to measure 1 cup. Heat gelatin mixture over low heat until gelatin is dissolved and stir in strawberries, raspberries, and syrup until combined. Divide mixture among four 1/2-cup molds. Chill gelées until firm, at least 6 hours, and up to 2 days. To unmold gelées, dip bottoms of molds, 1 at a time, into a bowl of hot water 3 seconds and invert gelées onto 4 small plates.
