Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, bell pepper, garlic, and oregano; sauté until soft, about 6 minutes. Add tomato sauce and wine and boil until almost evaporated, about 1 minute. Add crabmeat; lower heat to medium, cover, and cook 5 minutes. Stir in olives, cilantro, and hot sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from heat. Let stand 5 minutes. Spoon mixture into crab shells, if desired. Squeeze juice from lime wedges over and serve.
