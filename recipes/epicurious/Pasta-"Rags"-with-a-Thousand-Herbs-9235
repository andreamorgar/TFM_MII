If using fresh pasta, cut sheets into roughly 4- by 1-inch pieces with pastry wheel, then lightly dust with flour and arrange in 1 layer on paper-towel-lined large baking sheets. Let pasta dry until leathery but still pliable, 5 to 30 minutes. If using no-boil lasagne, break sheets into large pieces (about 4 by 1 inch). Cut an X in bottom of each tomato with a sharp paring knife and blanch tomatoes in a 3-quart saucepan of boiling water 10 seconds. Transfer tomatoes with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice and cold water and cool. Peel off skin, beginning from scored end, with a paring knife and discard. Halve tomatoes and discard seeds, then cut tomatoes into 1/4-inch dice. Stir together oil and herbs in a large bowl. Cook pasta in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water, uncovered, until al dente, 1 to 2 minutes for fresh pasta (time for dried pasta may vary). Drain, then toss with herb mixture. Add tomatoes, salt, pepper, and cheese and toss again. Season with salt and serve immediately, with additional cheese.
