Preheat oven to 450°F. Combine potatoes, oil and half of rosemary on large rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast until potatoes are almost tender, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, press garlic and remaining rosemary onto both sides of lamb chops; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Arrange lamb on baking sheet next to potatoes. Roast until potatoes are tender and lamb is cooked to desired doneness, about 18 minutes for medium-rare. Mound potatoes in center of platter. Surround with lamb chops. Sprinkle with tomatoes, cheese and olives and serve.
