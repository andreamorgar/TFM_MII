Whisk eggs, 1 tablespoon dill, salt and pepper to blend in large bowl. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté until beginning to soften and color, about 3 minutes. Add egg mixture; reduce heat to medium and stir until eggs are barely set, about 2 minutes. Dot eggs with bits of cream cheese; continue cooking until eggs are softly set and cheese melts, about 2 minutes. Transfer to platter. Top with dollop of sour cream, if desired. Garnish with salmon. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 tablespoon dill.
