Bring orange juice, 1 cup sugar and tangerines to boil in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Cover pan, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tangerines are very tender, about 35 minutes. Strain mixture through sieve set over medium bowl, pressing firmly on fruit. Transfer fruit to processor; puree until tangerine peel is finely chopped. Return puree to saucepan; mix in 1/2 cup strained syrup, reserving remaining syrup for another use. (Puree can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Preheat oven to 400°F. Beat cream, Grand Marnier and 2 tablespoons sugar in large bowl until stiff peaks form; refrigerate. Butter ten 2/3-cup soufflé dishes or ramekins; dust with sugar and arrange on baking sheet. Stir tangerine puree over low heat until warm; set aside. {Step One} Beat egg whites in another large bowl until soft peaks form. Beat in 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until egg whites are stiff and glossy. {Step Two} Fold 1/4 of whites into warm tangerine puree in saucepan. Fold tangerine mixture into remaining whites in bowl. Divide mixture among prepared dishes. Bake until puffed and brown, about 16 minutes. Serve with whipped cream.
