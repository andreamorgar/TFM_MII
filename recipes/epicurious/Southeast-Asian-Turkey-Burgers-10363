Thinly slice bottom 6 inches of lemongrass (1/4 cup), discarding remainder. Finely grind lemongrass, garlic, shallot, ginger, and chile with water and 2 teaspoons fish sauce in mini food processor, scraping down side frequently, until a paste forms. Mix paste and turkey with your hands until just combined (do not overmix) and form into 4 (3/4-inch-thick) patties (4 inches in diameter). Chill patties, covered with plastic wrap, 1 hour (to allow flavors to develop). Whisk together lime juice, oil, sugar, red-pepper flakes, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and remaining 2 teaspoons fish sauce until sugar is dissolved. Prepare grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-hot charcoal (medium heat for gas). Oil grill rack, then grill patties, covered only if using a gas grill, turning over once, until just cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes total. Whisk lime-juice sauce, then drizzle cut side of a bottom bun evenly with 1 tablespoon sauce. Top with a patty and 1/2 cup mixed herbs. Drizzle herbs with 1 tablespoon sauce and top with bun. Assemble 3 more burgers in same manner.
