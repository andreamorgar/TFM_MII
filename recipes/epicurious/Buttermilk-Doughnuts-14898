Place 1 1/2 cups flour and 1 1/4 cups sugar in large bowl. Add buttermilk and next 7 ingredients. Using electric mixer, beat mixture until just smooth. Beat in remaining 1 cup flour. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 6 hours. Turn dough out onto floured work surface; roll to 1/2-inch thickness. Using 3-inch round cookie cutter, cut dough into rounds. Using 1-inch round cookie cutter, cut hole from center of each round, making doughnuts. Gather scraps and reroll dough, cutting additional doughnuts until dough is used up. Pour oil into heavy large pot to depth of 5 inches. Heat oil to 350°F. Add 3 doughnuts at a time to oil and fry until golden, turning once, about 6 minutes total. Using slotted spoon, transfer to paper-towel-lined rack to drain. Repeat with remaining doughnuts. Cool. Sift powdered sugar thickly over doughnuts.
