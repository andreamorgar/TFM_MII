Combine chicken, 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon salt in medium bowl; let stand 30 minutes. Mix 1/4 cup plain yogurt, minced garlic, 1 1/2 tablespoons coriander, 2 teaspoons cumin, 1 teaspoon turmeric, 1/8 teaspoon ginger and crushed red pepper in small bowl. Add to chicken and stir until chicken is well coated with spice mixture. Refrigerate chicken at least 3 hours or overnight. Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Thread chicken on skewers, dividing equally. Brush chicken with melted butter. Season with salt. Grill kebabs until just cooked through, turning frequently, about 7 minutes.
