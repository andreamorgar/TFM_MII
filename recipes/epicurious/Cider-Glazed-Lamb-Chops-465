Boil cider, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, and honey in a small saucepan until reduced to about 1/4 cup, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool completely. Reserve 2 tablespoons glaze for drizzling. Preheat broiler. Pat lamb chops dry and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt (total). Arrange on rack of a broiler pan and brush top of chops with half of glaze. Broil 3 to 4 inches from heat 3 minutes. Turn over and brush with remaining glaze, then broil 3 to 4 minutes more for medium-rare. Transfer chops to a plate and drizzle with reserved glaze. Let stand 5 minutes, then sprinkle with scallion.
