Wash spinach well, discarding any course stems, and drain in colander. In a 3- to 4- quart saucepan bring water to a boil. Add spinach and steam covered, 2 minutes. Drain spinach in colander, gently pressing out most of liquid. In a bowl toss spinach with oil, soy sauce, and salt and pepper to taste. Chill spinach, uncovered, for 25 minutes. While spinach is chilling, in a dry small heavy skillet (not non-stick) toast sesame seeds over moderate heat, stirring, until golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Toss spinach with sesame seeds and vinegar.
