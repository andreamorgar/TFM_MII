Rinse squid under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels. Cut squid bodies into 1-inch-wide rings and leave tentacles whole. Bring vinegar, garlic, soy sauce, water, and pepper to a boil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan, then add squid (liquid will not cover squid) and cook over moderately high heat, stirring constantly, until opaque, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and immediately drain squid in a colander set over a bowl, reserving liquid. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté onion, stirring, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes (including juice) and boil, stirring occasionally, until most of liquid is evaporated, about 3 minutes. Add squid cooking liquid and boil, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, about 8 minutes. Stir in squid and simmer until cooked through, about 2 minutes.
