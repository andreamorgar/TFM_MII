Cook sugar in a dry 1-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, undisturbed, until it begins to melt. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally with a fork, until sugar is melted into a deep golden caramel. Remove from heat and carefully pour in orange juice, then rum (caramel will harden and steam vigorously). Cook over moderately low heat, stirring, until caramel is dissolved. Cool sauce to warm.
