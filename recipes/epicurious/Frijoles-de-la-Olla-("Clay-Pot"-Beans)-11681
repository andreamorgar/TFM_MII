Pick through the beans to remove any dirt or stones, then place in a large colander and rinse thoroughly. Transfer the beans to a large bowl, cover with 3 quarts of water, and soak overnight in the refrigerator. Drain the beans, reserving the liquid. Measure the liquid and add water, if needed, to make 2 1/2 quarts. Place the beans in a stockpot or large clay olla. Add the onion, garlic, oil or lard, and the reserved soaking liquid. Bring to a simmer, adjusting the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the beans are tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Keep the beans covered with 1 inch of water as they cook, adding boiling water if needed. Remove the onion and garlic and season to taste with salt.
