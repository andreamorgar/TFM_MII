Place foil on work surface. Stir sugar and 1/4 cup water in heavy medium saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush. Increase heat and boil without stirring until mixture turns deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 9 minutes. Mix in almonds. Immediately pour out onto foil, separating almonds with fork. Cool completely (mixture will harden). Boil apple cider in heavy large saucepan until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 23 minutes. Transfer to medium bowl and chill until cold. Add vinegar, onion, mustard and poppy seeds. Gradually whisk in olive oil. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper. Toss greens, cheese and almonds in bowl with enough dressing to coat; serve.
