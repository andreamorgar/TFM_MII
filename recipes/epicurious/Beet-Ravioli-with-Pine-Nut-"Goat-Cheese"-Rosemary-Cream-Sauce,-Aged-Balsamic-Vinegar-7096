Process all ingredients in a food processor until as smooth as possible. You should have about 4 cups. Reserve 2 cups for the sauce, and set aside the remainder. Puree all the ingredients in a high-speed blender until smooth. Using a mandoline, slice the beets very thin (so they are pliable and not stiff, approximately 1/16 of an inch or less). Make small stacks of the larger pieces and use a sharp knife to cut into squares-the size doesn't matter much, as long as they are all roughly the same. Alternatively, use a round-, heart-or other- shaped cookie cutter to cut the slices. Cut at least 40 slices-10 per serving, with a few extra to spare. In a medium bowl, place the beet slices, oil, lemon juice, and salt and toss gently to coat evenly. Allowing the beets to sit for a half hour or more will soften them; this is optional but a good idea if your slices are on the thicker side and still a bit stiff. Lay half the beet slices on a clean work surface and top each with a rounded teaspoonful of the cheese. Top with the remaining beet slices and press down gently. Spoon the sauce onto serving plates, and arrange the ravioli on top. Garnish with a few drops of aged balsamic vinegar and a few sprigs of either microgreens or fresh herbs.
