With a vegetable peeler cut 3 lengthwise strips of zest from lemon and cut strips crosswise into enough very thin slices to measure 1 packed teaspoon. Squeeze 2 tablespoons juice from lemon. Mince shallot and cut figs into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Pat pork dry and season with salt and pepper. In a skillet heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and sauté pork until browned, about 1 minute on each side. Transfer pork to a plate and in fat remaining in skillet cook shallot and gingerroot, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add pork, water, wine, zest, lemon juice, and figs and simmer, covered, 10 minutes, or until pork is just cooked through. Transfer pork to 2 plates and if fig mixture is too liquid boil until reduced to a sauce-like consistency, about 1 minute. Whisk butter into fig mixture until incorporated. Garnish pork with compote and serve with lemon slices.
