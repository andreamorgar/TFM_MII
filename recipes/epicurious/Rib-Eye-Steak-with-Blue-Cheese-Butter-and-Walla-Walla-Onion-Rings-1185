Season with freshly ground black pepper. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before using. Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Grill steaks to desired doneness, 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to cutting board; let rest 5 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk flour, coarse salt, and baking powder in medium bowl. Add beer and vodka; whisk just until blended. Pour enough oil into heavy large pot to reach depth of 2 inches. Attach deep-fry thermometer to side of pot; heat oil over medium heat to 350°F. Working with 2 onion rings at a time, dip onion rings into batter; shake off excess. Gently drop onion rings into hot oil; fry until deep golden, adjusting heat to maintain temperature, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer onion rings to paper towels. Repeat with remaining batter and onion rings. Cut steaks in half across grain. Place 1 steak half on each of 4 plates. Top with blue cheese butter and onion rings.
