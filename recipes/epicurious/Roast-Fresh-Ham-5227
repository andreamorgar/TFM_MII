The pork leg cut or fresh ham is quite versatile. It may be cooked either boned or with the bone in. Because of its size, it takes the time to cook perfectly in an oven set for 325°F. or 300°F. The fat covering eliminates the need for basting, but an occasional basting with red or white wine or broth does help the flavor and keeps a delicious moisture in the meat. Rub the roast well with sage, freshly ground black pepper, and touch of garlic. Place on a rack in a shallow pan. Roast to an internal temperature of 175°F. Remove from the oven, and allow to stand for 15 minutes in a warm place before carving. Serve with Lyonnaise potatoes, sautéd apple slices, and Burgundian Mustard. Blend the finely chopped pickles thoroughly with the mustard and add the cognac. If sealed in a jar, this will keep for several days.
