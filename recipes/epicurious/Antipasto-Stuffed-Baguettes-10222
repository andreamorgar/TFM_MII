Cut top third off each baguette horizontally with a serrated knife and remove soft crumb from tops and bottoms, leaving shells about 1/2 inch thick. Spread about 1 tablespoon olive paste or tapenade on inside of each bottom shell and top with goat cheese, spreading it evenly. Fold salami or turkey slices in half and fit them in an even layer over cheese in each shell. Arrange half of arugula on each meat layer and top with a layer of roasted peppers. Divide artichoke hearts between bottom shells and spread inside of top shells with remaining olive paste. Fit top shells over bottom shells and press baguette together, re-forming loaves. Wrap each baguette tightly in foil and chill at least 3 hours or overnight. Cut each baguette diagonally into 12 slices with a serrated knife and secure each slice with a wooden pick.
