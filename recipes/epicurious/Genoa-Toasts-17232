In a bowl mix together the oil and the garlic paste, brush both sides of the focaccia slices lightly with the oil mixture, and bake the slices in one layer on baking sheets in a preheated 250°F. oven for 30 minutes. Turn the slices, sprinkle them with the salt, and bake them for 30 minutes more, or until they are pale golden and crisp.
