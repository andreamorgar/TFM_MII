In a small saucepan of boiling salted water cook beans until just tender, about 3 minutes. Drain beans and plunge into a bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking. Remove beans from water and pat dry with paper towels. Chop eggs and in a bowl stir together with celery, onion, mayonnaise, mustard, and salt and pepper to taste. Spread egg salad on 4 bread slices and top each sandwich with 4 beans and remaining bread slices.
