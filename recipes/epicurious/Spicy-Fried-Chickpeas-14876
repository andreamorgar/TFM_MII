In large heavy pot, heat 3 inches oil until deep-fat thermometer registers 375°F. Carefully add chickpeas and fry until crisp and dark golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Using fine-mesh spider or slotted spoon, transfer to paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle immediately with paprika and salt and serve hot. (Chickpeas can be made up to 4 hours ahead and stored at room temperature. Rewarm in microwave or broiler before serving.)
