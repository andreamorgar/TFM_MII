Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss potatoes with 2 tablespoons olive oil, thyme, and 1 teaspoon salt in medium bowl. Arrange potatoes in roasting pan; cover pan with foil. Roast until tender when pierced with fork, about 40 minutes. Cool 10 minutes. Cut potatoes in half lengthwise. Meanwhile, toss frisée, dandelion leaves, and parsley in large bowl. Whisk vinegar and remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in small bowl to blend. Sauté bacon in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; add shallots and potatoes to skillet and sauté 2 minutes. Add vinegar mixture and swirl pan until heated through. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour bacon mixture over greens; toss to coat and serve.
