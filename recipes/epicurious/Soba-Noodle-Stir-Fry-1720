Cook the noodles according to the package directions. Drain and rinse well under cold water to prevent sticking. Lightly coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray; place over medium-high heat. Add the tofu and season with salt. Cook for 8 minutes, until golden, stirring occasionally. Transfer to a platter. Coat the skillet again with cooking spray; place over medium-high heat. Add the broccoli, peas, and a splash of water. Cover and cook for 5 minutes, until the vegetables are crisp-tender. Meanwhile, make the sauce. In a small bowl, whisk together the peanut butter and 2 tablespoons water. Whisk in the vinegar, soy sauce, and pepper flakes, if desired. Add the reserved noodles, the tofu, garlic, and sauce to the vegetables. Cook for 2 minutes, tossing, until the noodles are warmed through. Serve.
