Preheat the oven to 180C/355F/Gas 4.Place the apples, sugar, lemon juice, apricot jam and water into a saucepan along with 25g/1oz of the butter. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to simmer, until the apple is tender and lightly caramelised.Meanwhile, melt the remaining 50g/2oz butter in a saucepan over a medium heat.Cut the slices of bread in half, then cut each half into four slices to make small fingers. Dip each finger of bread into the melted butter and place into four ovenproof ramekins to line the inside edge and base, reserving a few bread fingers for the lid.Once each ramekin is lined, spoon in the apple mixture and top with more bread fingers dipped in the melted butter.Place the ramekins onto a baking sheet and transfer to the oven to bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden-brown on top.Meanwhile, for the custard, place the cream, milk and thyme into a saucepan over a low heat and bring to scalding point, then simmer very gently for 5-6 minutes to infuse the flavours.Place the egg yolks and sugar into a clean bowl and whisk together.Pour the thyme-infused milk and cream mixture onto the eggs and stir vigorously, then return to the saucepan and place over a gentle heat to simmer, stirring continuously, until the custard has thickened. Strain into a clean bowl to remove the thyme.Remove the charlottes from the oven and allow to cool slightly, then carefully turn them out onto plates.To serve, top the charlottes with whipped cream and place a spoonful of custard around the plate.
