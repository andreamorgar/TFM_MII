Lightly brush the edges of the pastry discs with melted butter and spread the membrillo in the middle of each disc. Arrange the apple slices on top.Drizzle the apple with a little honey and scatter over the sugar and bake in the oven for 5-6 minutes, until golden brown.Meanwhile, make the honey and walnut cream. Whip the double cream until thick, then fold in the walnuts and honey.Remove the tarts from the oven and glaze with a little of the remaining butter. Serve with a spoonful of the walnut cream mixture and garnish with a sprig of mint.
