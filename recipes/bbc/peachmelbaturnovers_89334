Preheat the oven to 180C/355F/Gas mark 4.Cut out six 20cm/8in circles from the ready-rolled pastry.Gently mix the peaches and cream cheese together in a bowl.Divide the peach and cream cheese mixture between the six pastry circles, placing the mixture on only one half of each circle.Sprinkle the sugar evenly over each portion of peach and cream cheese filling and add an equal amount of raspberries to each.Fold the clean half of each pastry circle over the filling to create semi-circles.Brush the edges of the pastry with egg wash and press down to seal.Crimp the edges of the pastries with a fork and brush all over with the egg wash.Transfer the pastries to a large baking sheet and place into the oven to bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the pastry is golden-brown and cooked through.For the sauce, place the sugar, water and sherry into a pan over a medium heat. Bring to the boil and cook until the mixture has thickened to a syrup.To serve, place a turnover onto each plate and drizzle with the sauce. Add a dollop of ice cream alongside and serve.
