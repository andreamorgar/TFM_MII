Before cooking, wash your hands and put on an apron. Weigh or measure all the ingredients. Ask a grown-up to preheat the oven at 200C/400F/Gas 6.Make sure you ask a grown-up to help you use the knife – cut around the plums lengthways, then twist the plums in half and pull out the stone.Lay the plums flat side down and cut them in half again. Put them into a casserole dish with the orange juice and honey and stir until all the plums are coated.Melt the butter in a small saucepan – you will need a grown-up to help you with this. Put to one side to cool down a little while you cut the bread into large squares with the table knife to make the topping. Drop the bread into the butter and swish it around to coat the bread.  Stir in half of the demerara sugar until well combined.Tip the bread on top of the plums and sprinkle the top with the remaining demerara sugar.Ask a grown-up to place the casserole into the oven for 20-25 minutes or until the topping is golden-brown and crisp and the fruit is soft. Serve with yoghurt or custard.
