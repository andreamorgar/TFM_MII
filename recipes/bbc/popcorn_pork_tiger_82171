For the garlic mayonnaise, remove the root from each of the garlic cloves.Fill a pan with cold water and add the garlic. Bring to the boil.Once the water has boiled, drain and repeat the process two more times (this process is called blanching).Once the cloves have been boiled three times, immediately place the garlic into iced water to cool down rapidly.Drain the garlic, add to the mayonnaise and blend in a food processor until smooth.For the smoked bacon relish, cook the bacon in a small saucepan until crisp. Drain off the excess fat, reserving it to cook the popcorn later.Add the onion and cook until soft and translucent with no colour.Add white wine vinegar and chicken stock. Continue to cook until the liquid has almost evaporated.Add the chopped herbs, mix, then set aside and keep warm for serving.For the popcorn tiger prawns, put half the reserved smoked bacon fat in a small saucepan with a lid. Add the popcorn kernels, put on the pan lid and heat the pan. Turn off the heat once the kernels have finished popping, being careful not to burn them by cooking too long.Drain the popcorn on kitchen paper to remove excess oil.Blend the popcorn in a spice grinder or blender until it is a fine powder.Grind down the pork scratchings to a powder and then mix the two powders together. Season to taste with salt.Fry the tiger prawns in a hot non-stick pan with the remaining smoked bacon fat, for about two minutes per side.Place the cooked prawns on kitchen paper to drain off any excess fat and then roll the cooked prawns in the popcorn powder coating.Serve on bed of dressed salad leaves and pot of garlic mayonnaise and smoked bacon relish.
