Season, to taste, with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.Drizzle the contents of the roasting tray with two tablespoons of the olive oil and roast in the oven for 20 minutes.When the chicken has been roasted, add the wine to the tin and cook for another 20-25 minutes. Remove from the oven.Heat the butter and remaining tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. When the butter is foaming, add the mushrooms and garlic and fry for 3-5 minutes. Tip the mushrooms and garlic into the tin and scatter with the parsley.Meanwhile, for the crème fraîche mash, boil the potatoes in a pan of salted water until tender.
