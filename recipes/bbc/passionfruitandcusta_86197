Add the remaining sugar and whisk again until thick and glossy.Place the custard into a separate large bowl, add the passion fruit seeds and pulp and mix well. Gently fold in the whisked  egg whites. Spoon the mixture into the prepared ramekins and place onto a baking sheet.Transfer to the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until risen and golden-brown.Meanwhile, for the bananas, heat the butter in a non-stick pan until it turns slightly brown. Add the sugar and the bananas and cook, stirring frequently, until the bananas are golden-brown all over.To serve, place the soufflés onto serving plates in their ramekin dishes.
