Put the trifle dish on a large tray to make it easy to carry. Slice one of the Madeira cakes into 0.5cm/¼in slices and use a few of the pieces to line the bottom of the dish. (Make sure they are nice and tight and in a single layer, so push down any bits that are standing up too high.)Brush the sponge with some of the amaretto. Then take a few strawberries halves that are roughly the same size and put them point upwards on the outer edge of the cake so the cut edges are pressing up against the glass. Repeat all the way round the dish.Sprinkle some crumbled amaretti biscuits on top of the sponge to a third of the way up the strawberries.Place the vanilla, icing sugar and cream in a bowl and whisk until thick and well combined.Spread a third of the cream on top of the strawberries and crumbled biscuits, and smooth it down with a spoon.Once the cream mixture is level in the bowl, wipe round the edge with kitchen towel. Sprinkle over with white chocolate.Repeat the layering process until the bowl is full, finishing with a layer of strawberries. Chill in the fridge until ready to eat.Shortly before serving, you can flambé the top of the trifle. To do this, place some amaretto in a stainless steel ladle. Warm it through over low heat. Gently ignite the mixture and pour it over the trifle. (CAUTION: Keep your face and hair away from the flames. Do not leave unattended.)
