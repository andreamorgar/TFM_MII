Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.Remove the cheese from the wooden box. Remove and discard any paper or wax wrapping then return the cheese to its box. Place the cheese in its box onto a non-stick baking tray lined with aluminium foil.Use a small, sharp knife to make several incisions in the top if the cheese. Insert the garlic slices into the incisions, scatter over the thyme leaves and drizzle with the honey.Transfer to the oven and bake for ten minutes or until the middle of the cheese is hot and melting.Meanwhile, heat a griddle pan. Generously drizzle both sides of the bread slices with olive oil, add to the griddle pan and cook on both sides until toasted and lightly charred. Remove from the pan and slice or tear into bite-sized pieces.To serve, place the cheese, still in its box, onto a serving plate. Place the griddled bread alongside for dipping.
