Preheat the oven to 140C/280F/Gas 1. Lay the breast of lamb out lengthways and score it using a sharp knife. Rub in the chopped rosemary and season with salt and pepper. Cut in half into two equal pieces. Roll each half tightly like a Swiss roll and tie with string.In a casserole pan, heat the oil. Add the shallots to the pan. Cook until caramelised. Add the mushrooms and then the wine and stock. Bring up to the boil and then turn down to a simmer.Heat a little more oil in another pan and fry the lamb rolls to brown all over, then add them to the stock. Place a lid on the top and put into the preheated oven to cook for three hours. Remove from the oven, transfer to a clean bowl and leave to cool to room temperature. Take out the lamb and carefully remove the string.Roll the lamb very tightly in cling film to keep their shape. Put them into the fridge to chill for eight hours. Pass the sauce through a fine sieve into a saucepan and cook over a medium heat to reduce the stock down to a sauce consistency. Keep it in the fridge until needed.When ready to serve, remove the clingfilm from the lamb and slice into discs and dust in a little flour. Heat some oil in a pan and fry until crisp and brown all over.For the broccoli, in a large pan, bring 150ml/5fl oz water and the butter up to the boil and add the broccoli stalks. Season with salt and cook until tender. The water and butter should emulsify to a lovely glaze.Mix all of the dressing ingredients together in a bowl and leave to the side. Reheat the lamb sauce and serve the lamb discs with the broccoli and dressing on the side.
