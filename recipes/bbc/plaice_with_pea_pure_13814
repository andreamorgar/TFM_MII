Grease the paper with a little butter and line the basket of the bamboo steamer with it. Season the rolls of plaice with salt and pepper and place them on the paper.When the potatoes have been cooking for seven minutes, add to them the asparagus and peas in their pods and steam for a further 2-3 minutes or until tender.Place the top basket containing the plaice on top of the vegetables and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until cooked through (take care not to overcook them).To serve, toss the pea shoots in a little rapeseed oil and divide the plaice fillets between four serving plates. Add some pea purée, crisp bacon and steamed vegetables. Garnish with the dressed pea shoots.
