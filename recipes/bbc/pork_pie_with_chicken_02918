Grease a deep 20cm/8in round cake tin with vegetable fat.For the pastry, sift the flours and salt into a large mixing bowl. Add the butter and rub it into the dry ingredients using your fingertips until loose crumbs form and there are no large chunks of butter remaining.Add the vegetable fat and boiling water to a jug and stir until the fat is dissolved. Make a well in the middle of the flour mixture and pour in the fat mixture. Beat using a wooden spoon until the dough comes together in a ball. Knead the dough in the bowl until smooth and well combined. Wrap in cling film and refrigerate while you make the filling.Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Place the baking tray in the oven to preheat.For the filling, mix the onion, chicken, apricots and thyme in a bowl. Season generously with salt and pepper.Remove the pastry from the fridge and set aside about a third to make the lid. Briefly knead the remaining dough and place in the bottom of the cake tin. Using your hands, gently push the dough out to cover the base and sides of the tin in an even layer of pastry. (Alternatively, you can roll out the pastry on a floured work surface and line the tin that way.) Make sure there are no cracks or holes in the pastry. Roll out the reserved pastry on a floured work surface to make the lid.Fill the pastry case with a layer of sausagemeat, then all the chicken and apricot mixture, a layer of potato slices and finally another layer of sausagemeat. Place the lid on top of the pie and crimp the edges to seal. Using a sharp knife, cut away any excess pastry overhanging the tin and cut a small circle in the middle of the lid for steam to escape when cooking. Brush the lid with beaten egg.Place the pie on the preheated tray (this will help the base crisp up and catch any fat that leaks from the pie) and bake for 1 hour 20 minutes, or until the top is deep golden-brown.Leave to cool completely in the tin, then serve in slices.
