Preheat the oven to 160C/320/Gas 2.Using a sharp knife, cut the skin of the sausages and squeeze out the sausage meat filling.Place the sausage meat into a large bowl, add the apricots, pistachio nuts and parsley and mix together well. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to correct the taste. (To do this, fry a small amount of the mixture in a frying pan for 1-2 minutes, or until completely cooked, then taste to check the seasoning.)Place the rashers of streaky bacon along the edge of a loaf tin, overlapping the bacon in the base a little, but leaving about 3cm/1¼in of the rashers draping over the sides of the tin.Divide the sausage meat mixture into three portions. Place one portion into the bottom of the loaf tin to cover the bacon on the base.Add several slices of the chicken to cover the sausage meat, then top with the chicken livers.Add another layer of sausage meat, followed by a layer of chicken breasts and a layer of chicken livers. When the tin is full, fold over the draping bacon to cover the filling.Lightly brush a piece of aluminium foil with olive oil and fold over the top of the loaf tin, tucking around the edges to seal.Place the loaf tin into a bain-marie half-full of hot water and place into the oven to cook for about 1¼ - 1½ hours, or until completely cooked through.Remove the loaf tin from the oven and allow to cool completely before placing in the fridge to chill.To serve, turn the bacon-wrapped terrine out of the tin and cut into slices. Place a slice onto a plate and serve with beetroot, frisée and rocket alongside.
