Lightly grease the tins and line the bases with non-stick baking parchment.  Pre-heat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.Measure the butter or margarine, sugar, eggs, flour, and baking powder into a large bowl and beat for about two minutes, until just blended; an electric mixer is best for this, but of course you can also beat by hand with a wooden spoon.Divide the mixture evenly between the prepared tins and level the surface with the back of a spoon or a plastic spatula.Bake for about 25 minutes, until well risen and golden.  The tops of the cakes should spring back when pressed lightly with a finger.  Leave the cakes to cool in the tins for a few minutes, then run a small palette knife or blunt knife around the edge of the tins to fee the sides of the cakes.  Turn the cakes out on to a wire rack, peel off the paper and leave to cool completely.Choose the cake with the best top, then put the other cake top downwards on to a serving plate.  Spread with the jam, put the other cake on top (top upwards) and sprinkle with caster sugar to serve.
