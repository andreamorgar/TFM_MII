Simmer for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly until the sauce is thick and smooth.Add the cheese, egg yolk, mustard, Worcestershire sauce and cayenne pepper, if using. Cook until the cheese melts, stirring constantly. Season with freshly ground black pepper and set aside to cool.Place the bread on a baking tray lined with aluminium foil and toast on each side until golden-brown.
