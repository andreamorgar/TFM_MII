For the filling, bring the figs, brandy, rosewater and water to a simmer in a pan, stirring well until combined. Continue to simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the fruit has softened and most of the liquid has evaporated (the mixture should resemble jam).Remove the pan from the heat and set aside for 10 minutes to cool slightly. Transfer the mixture to a food processor and blend until smooth.Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease a baking tray with butter.For the pastry, blend the wholemeal flour, plain flour, butter, sugar and salt in a food processor until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.With the motor still running, gradually add the water in a thin stream until the mixture comes together as a dough (you may not need to use all of the water).Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and wrap in cling film. Chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.When the dough has chilled, roll it out onto a lightly floured work surface to a 40cm x 12cm/16in x 5in rectangle.Spread the filling mixture lengthways down the centre of the pastry rectangle. Fold one of the edges of the pastry over the filling mixture, then cover with the other edge of the pastry.Slice the filled pastry into 12-15 7.5cm/3in slices and place each slice onto the prepared baking tray, folded edge down. Press the flat of a wet fork into the top of each fig roll to create a ridged effect. Bake in the oven for 18-20 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown. Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool.
