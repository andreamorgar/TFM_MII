Mix the soy, honey and lime juice together to form a fairly thick marinade.Score the skin of the duck breast with a sharp knife half a dozen times.Preheat a pan and spoon half the marinade in. Immediately it will bubble and smoke, which is the time to add the duck, skin side down.Cook the duck for one minute on each side to take on colour, then take it out of the pan.Take one sheet of foil, 30cm (12in) long. Lay the duck on one half of foil and season well.Fold the foil over and scrunch round the edges it to form an 'envelope' so the duck is completely sealed.Take another larger sheet of foil to make the 'smoking bag'. Sprinkle the wood chippings in the middle of this piece of foil and place the foil envelope containing the duck on top of these chippings.Take a sharp knife and prick the top of the inner bag, containing the duck, 20 times - this is to allow the smoke flavour to reach the meat. Now fold the outer foil over the top and seal it to create a 'smoking bag' around the duck parcel.Preheat a griddle pan over a medium-high heat and sit the foil parcel in the pan. Smoke over a medium heat for eight minutes until the duck is cooked but still nice and pink. You can put it in a preheated oven or on the barbecue to finish it off if you like (NOTE: smoking food in this way can produce a lot of smoke so it is advisable to open windows or an outside door during cooking and not to leave the food unattended).While the duck is smoking, blanch the pak choi in boiling salted water for one minute, then drain and toss in the sesame oil, lime juice and ginger.To serve, lay the pak choi on the plate, slice the duck into seven or eight slices and lay the duck on top. Drizzle around the rest of the marinade.
