For the honeycomb, line a baking tray with a little oil and baking parchment.Place the sugar, honey, glucose and 50ml/2fl oz water into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Continue to cook until the temperature reaches 160C/320F on a sugar thermometer.Remove from the heat and quickly beat in the bicarbonate of soda, stirring constantly. Pour the mixture onto the lined baking tray.Set aside until completely cool and then break into large pieces.Melt the chocolate in a bowl suspended over a pan of simmering water (do not allow the bottom of the bowl to touch the water), or in the microwave.Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper.Dip each piece of honeycomb into the melted chocolate and then place onto the lined tray. Leave for one hour until the chocolate is set and hard.For the parfait, grease a loaf tin with a little vegetable oil and then line with two layers of cling film.In a clean mixing bowl, whisk the egg whites until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. Gradually whisk in half of the sugar and continue to whisk until firm peaks are formed.Whisk the egg yolks and remaining sugar in a bowl over a pan of simmering water for about 5-6 minutes, or until the mixture thickens.Place the cream and scraped vanilla seeds into a separate bowl and whisk until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl.Gently fold the meringue, egg yolks and cream together in a bowl gently until just mixed together.Roughly chop the chocolate honeycomb and then fold it into the mixture, making sure it’s distributed evenly.Pour the mixture into the lined loaf tin and place in the freezer for at least for hours, or until firm.To serve, remove the parfait from the freezer and leave for one hour to soften slightly before slicing and serving.
