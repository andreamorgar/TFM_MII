Preheat the oven to 200C/Gas 6.Using a sharp knife carefully cut a cross into the bottom of each chestnut - this will prevent them exploding when roasting.Place the chestnuts onto a baking tray and transfer to the oven to roast for 20 minutes, or until tender, then remove from the oven and allow to cool. Peel off the chestnut shells and slice the nuts finely and set aside.Season the pheasant with salt and freshly ground black pepper and lightly drizzle with olive oil.Heat a griddle pan until hot, then add the pheasant pieces skin-side down and lightly griddle until golden-brown. Turn the breasts and thighs over and continue cooking, until almost completely cooked through, but still a little pink (or for longer according to your taste) The thighs will take longer to cook than the breasts, so be sure to cook them for longer. The juices will run clear when pierced with a skewer.Meanwhile, heat a frying pan until hot, then add the bacon lardons and fry until golden brown all over.Drain the lardons of any fat and place into a saucepan.Add the chestnuts, sprouts and cream and bring to the boil. Cook for 4-5 minutes, or until the sprouts are just tender and the cream has reduced and thickened.Place the red wine in a small frying pan and place over a medium heat. Bring to the boil and cook until reduced by two-thirds of the original volume.To serve, place the creamed sprouts and chestnuts onto two warm plates. Top each with a pheasant breast and thigh and spoon a little of the red wine reduction around.
