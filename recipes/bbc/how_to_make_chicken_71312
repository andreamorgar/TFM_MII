Transfer the chicken to the fridge for 15 minutes.When ready to cook the chicken, heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan.

Fry until the skin is browned. Depending on the size of your frying pan, you may need to fry the chicken in batches - don't crowd the pan.Turn down the heat to low, then turn the chicken over to fry the other side.
