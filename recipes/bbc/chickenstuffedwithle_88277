Mash slightly with a fork to make a paste, then stir in the blanched leeks, basil, ginger, double cream, salt and freshly ground black pepper.Spoon the mixture into the pocket in the chicken breast and pull the flesh over to seal the filling inside. Roll the chicken in the sesame seeds.Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the chicken and fry on all sides until golden-brown.
