Place the pheasants into the casserole pot and brown until pale golden on all sides.

Carefully pour off any excess fat that has emerged from the lardons.Return the pheasants to the pot and sprinkle over the apples. Pour over the calvados and set alight. Once the flames have died down add 290ml/½ pint of the cider and the chicken stock.

Bring to a boil and simmer gently for 5 minutes.Strain the sauce into a bowl through a fine meshed sieve. Pour the strained sauce back into the pot and add a splash of calvados. Reduce by half.
