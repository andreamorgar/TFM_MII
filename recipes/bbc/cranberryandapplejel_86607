For the jelly, place the apples, cranberries and cinnamon into a large saucepan and pour over enough water to just cover. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes until the apples and cranberries are broken down.Pass the mixture through a sieve lined with a clean kitchen cloth or muslin into a large jug. Discard the pulp left in the sieve.For every 600ml/1 pint of liquid you have, add 500g/1lb 2oz of granulated sugar.Pour the mixture back into a clean pan with a sugar thermometer and cook slowly until it reaches 220C/105F - alternatively, place a spoonful of the jelly onto a cold plate and check if it sets.Pour the jelly into warm sterilised jars while still hot and allow to cool and set.For the roast pork, preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan. Season the pork with salt and freshly ground black pepper and place into the frying pan. Cook briefly on all sides until lightly browned all over.Transfer to a roasting tin and place in the oven for 40-60 minutes, or until the crackling is golden and the pork is completely cooked through.To serve, carve the pork into portions and place onto serving plates with a spoonful of the cranberry and apple jelly.
