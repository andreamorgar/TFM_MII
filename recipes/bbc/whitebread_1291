Mix the yeast with a little of the milk to get a creamy liquid.Put the flour and the salt in a bowl and rub in the butter.Stir in the yeast liquid and the rest of the milk to get a soft dough.Turn on to a lightly floured work surface and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 10-15 minutes. Put in a clean bowl and cover with clingfilm. Stand in a warm place for 1 hour to rise.Heat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Lightly oil a 1kg/2¼lb bread tin.Turn the dough on to the work surface again and knead for 5-10 minutes. Shape the dough into a loaf shape to fit the tin and place in the tin. Cover with a clean tea towel and allow to rise back up again, about 15 minutes.Bake in the oven until golden and risen, about 30-40 minutes. The base of the loaf should sound hollow when you tap it. Turn on to a wire rack to cool.
