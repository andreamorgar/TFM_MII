Preheat the grill to high.In a small saucepan toast the pine kernels for approximately two minutes (do not let them burn).Add the sage and white wine and gently simmer for one minute.Add the cream, season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper and cook on a low heat until thickened.Using a hand-held blender, blend the mixture to create a smooth sauce texture.In a large frying pan, fry the garlic in eight tablespoons of olive oil until well-browned over a medium heat, allowing the olive oil to flavour.Remove the garlic with a slotted spoon and discard, then add the rosemary to the oil.Slice the pre-cooked potatoes approximately 1cm/0.5in thick and cook in the flavoured oil for approximately two minutes each side or until golden and crisp.Meanwhile, place the lamb cutlets on a large tray, drizzle over a couple of tablespoons of olive oil, the balsamic vinegar, and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Using your hands, mix the seasoning into the meat and grill for approximately two minutes each side, or until cooked to your liking.To serve, stack 4-5 potato slices on top of each other in the middle of each of four plates. Lean three lamb cutlets against the potato stack and drizzle with the hot sage sauce. 11. Serve with the green beans.
