Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.Line a baking sheet with non-stick silicone paper.In a clean bowl whisk the egg white until very stiff. This is best done with a freestanding electric mixer.Now add the sugar one third at a time, whisking well between each batch.Once the sugar has all been added continue to whisk until the mixture is very thick and glossy.Spread over the prepared baking sheet, then sprinkle liberally with the coconut or almonds.Bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown and just firm to the touch.Remove from the oven and at once turn on to a piece of greaseproof paper or a clean tea towel.Leave for 15 minutes then remove the backing paper.Make the syllabub while the meringue is cooking. Mix the zest, juice and honey, stirring until the honey has dissolved.Place this mixture with the chilled cream in a large bowl then whisk until floppy.When the meringue is cool spread the syllabub over, place the raspberries on top and roll up. Chill until needed.
