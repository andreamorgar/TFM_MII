Place the couscous, salt and pine nuts in a lidded saucepan and stir well.Pour the water over (it should be about 2cm/¾in above the couscous).Put the pan lid on and leave until ready to serve.Gently fork the couscous to break up the grains, before transferring to a bowl to serve.This makes a great salad meal if you let the couscous go cold and keep in the fridge. If you are serving the couscous with a spicy main, leave this dish the way it is and serve hot. If you're serving it with a plainer meat, such as lamb chops, you could soften some onion in olive oil, and add fresh ginger, chilli and garlic before adding the couscous to the pan.
