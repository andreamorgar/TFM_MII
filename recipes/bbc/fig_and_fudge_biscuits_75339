Before cooking, wash your hands and put on an apron. Weigh or measure all the ingredients. Ask a grown-up to preheat the oven to 180C/350/Gas 4. Place a sheet of baking paper onto a baking tray.Put the flour and butter into a mixing bowl and rub the two together to make a crumbly mixture.Snip the stalk off the dried fig then cut the fruit into small pieces using the scissors (ask a grown-up to help you). Add to the bowl with the sugar and the fudge pieces.Use your hands to start to squeeze it all together – you can push down with your knuckles into the bowl. As it starts to make a lump, turn the bowl out onto the work surface and continue squeezing to make a long, fat sausage shape.Tear the mixture in half. Pull each piece into half again then each smaller piece into two, trying to keep them about the same size. This makes eight pieces of biscuit dough.Roll each piece into a round ball then put onto the lined tray and flatten a little with your hand – repeat with the other seven biscuits.Ask a grown-up to put the baking tray in a preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until the biscuits are light golden-brown. Leave to cool on the paper. Serve with some red grapes or more dried fig.
