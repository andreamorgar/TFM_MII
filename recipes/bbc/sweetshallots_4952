Blanch the shallots in boiling water for a couple of minutes. This makes removing the skins easier.Melt the butter with the oil in a frying pan and add the peeled shallots. Fry for a minute and then sprinkle with sugar or add the honey and coat the shallots. Take care that the shallots don t start to burn.Season well and then pour over enough cold water to cover. Bring to the boil and cook on a medium heat until all the liquid is reduced and the shallots are softened and caramelised.
