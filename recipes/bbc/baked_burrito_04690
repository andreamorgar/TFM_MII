Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 4.Peel and roughly chop the onion. Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat, then add a dash of oil and the onion. Cook for 7-10 minutes, or until soft and translucent but not brown. Reduce the heat if the onion starts to colour.Cut the turkey meat into 2½cm/1in cubes and add them and the Mexican seasoning to the onion. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring now and again, or until the turkey is cooked through with no sign of pink juices when you cut into the largest cube.Grate the cut sides of the tomatoes into the pan, using a cheese grater, and stir. Discard the skin once the flesh is grated. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the tomato mixture has thickened and coats the turkey. Add the sweetcorn and stir.Put the tortilla wraps on a chopping board and spoon the meat mixture into the middle of the wraps. Sprinkle with the grated cheese. Fold the sides of the wraps over the filling, then roll the wraps up from bottom to top to enclose the filling completely.Put the wraps, folded side-down on a baking tray. Put a little oil into your hand and gently rub it over the wraps. Place in the oven and bake for 7 minutes, then turn the wraps over and bake for a further 5 minutes, or until golden and crisp all over.Serve each burritos with a tablespoon of yoghurt on the side for dipping.
