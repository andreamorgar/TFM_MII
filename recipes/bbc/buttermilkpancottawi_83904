For the buttermilk pannacotta, heat the double cream in a small saucepan with the split vanilla pod.Remove from the heat once it has boiled, and add the condensed milk.Gently squeeze dry the gelatine leaves, and add to the hot cream. Stir until the gelatine has dissolved.When the cream mixture has cooled to near body temperature, add the buttermilk, and stir gently to mix in.Remove the vanilla pod and scrape out the seeds. Stir the seeds into the cream mixture.Carefully pour the mixture into four 8-10cm/3-4in ramekins, making sure that each mould has a good amount of the vanilla seeds in it.Allow to set in the fridge for at least four hours.Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5.Halve the apricots, stone them, and gently roll them in the lemon juice to prevent discolouration.Place 50ml/1¾oz water in an ovenproof dish with the remaining lemon juice, the orange juice, and the lemon peels, add the apricot halves skin side down.  Sprinkle the sugar over them.Cover loosely, but firmly with foil, and bake in the hot oven for approximately ten minutes, the exact time will depend on size and ripeness of fruit.When cooked, the tip of a knife should easily pierce the flesh of the fruit with no resistance. The juices of the fruit will blend with the liquids in the dish.Reduce this liquid by removing the fruits carefully with a slotted spoon, and pour the juices into a small pan.Boil down to a syrup like consistency. Return the fruit to the syrup off the heat, and allow to cool.To serve, dip the pannacotta moulds into hot water for a few seconds, then gently turn out a buttermilk pannacotta in  to the centre of a soup plate. Surround with two halves of apricots and a spoonful or two of the syrup. Garnish with a piece of the vanilla pod. Serve with biscotti on the side.
