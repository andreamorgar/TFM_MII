Remove the sheet from the tray and allow the crisps to cool and set.Heat the tomatoes, wine, chilli and garlic in a frying pan until simmering.Add the mussels to the pan, cover with a lid and cook gently for 3-4 minutes, or until the mussels have opened. Discard any that remain closed.Stir in the prawns and parsley to warm them through, then add the cooked pasta.Spoon the linguine and sauce onto a serving plate. Sprinkle the parmesan over the top and serve with the parmesan crisps.
