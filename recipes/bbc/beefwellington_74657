Brush this with beaten egg and seal.Trim the ends of the pastry so they are flush with the beef.Cut a sheet of baking paper to the size of the beef Wellington.Place the beef Wellington on the paper, lightly brush the top with melted butter and refrigerate for 30 minutes.Put the beef Wellington in the oven and cook for 25 minutes or until dark golden in colour.Serve with steamed spinach or roast vegetables of your choice.
