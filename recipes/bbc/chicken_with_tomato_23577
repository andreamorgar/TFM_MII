Remove the dish, peel back the cling film and turn the chicken so that any cooked parts on the outside are in the centre. Re-cover and cook for another minute.Remove the dish and transfer the chicken to a plate using a fork.Add the onion and garlic to the dish. Cook on full power for two minutes.Add the pepper and courgette to the onions, stir well and cook on full power for another two minutes.Add the tomatoes to the vegetables. Measure in the tomato purée, Worcestershire sauce and vinegar. Stir to combine.Add the chicken and any juices so that they are completely covered with tomato sauce.Cover the dish with cling film in the same way as before and cook on full power for three minutes.Carefully peel back the cling film, keeping your hands and wrists out of the way, as steam can cause burns.
