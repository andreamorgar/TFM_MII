For the sweetcorn stock, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.Place the sweetcorn on a baking tray and cook in the oven for 20 minutes. Set aside to cool.When the sweetcorn is cooled, stand the cobs upright on a chopping board, and cut down as close as possible to the core to remove the kernels. Set aside the kernels and cut the cores of the sweetcorn in half and place them in a large saucepan. Cover them with the water and bring to the boil. Simmer for 20 minutes, then strain into a jug and set aside, reserving both the stock and the kernels.For the braised sweetcorn and wood pigeon, reduce the oven temperature to 160C/320F/Gas 3.Season the wood pigeon with salt and pepper and heat a large frying pan.When the pan is hot, add one tablespoon of the oil and place the pigeons into the hot pan.
