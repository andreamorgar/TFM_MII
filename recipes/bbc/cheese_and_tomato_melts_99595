Before cooking, wash your hands and put on an apron. Weigh or measure all the ingredients. Ask a grown-up to preheat the oven at 200C/400F/Gas 6. Line a baking tray with some baking paper.Place the flour into the mixing bowl and add the paprika and butter. Rub the butter into the flour.Cut the spring onion up into small pieces with the scissors (ask a grown-up to help you) - take off the roots and the dark green leaves first; this is called topping and tailing. Start by cutting it into chunks, then add to the bowl and chop more in the bowl.Add the grated cheese and stir the mixture together with a fork. Add two tablespoons of tomato juice and mix well with a spoon. If the dough isn’t sticking together then add a little more tomato juice until the mixture becomes a smooth dough.Roll the dough out on a floured surface to a thickness of about 1cm/½in . Then cut circles with a 5cm/2in round biscuit cutter. Place the biscuits onto the lined baking tray.Ask a grown-up to put the cheese and tomato melts into the oven for 10-15 minutes or until firm. Leave to cool before eating.  Serve them with apple slices.
