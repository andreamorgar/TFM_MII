Put the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and break in the eggs. Using a whisk, gradually work in all the flour until you have a thick batter. Then gradually pour in all the milk, whisking as you go, until it is all incorporated.Leave the batter to stand for at least half an hour – you will find it thickens slightly.About 10 minutes before you are ready to cook the pancake, preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.Coat a roasting tray or baking dish with the melted butter and pour in the batter. Bake for around 30 minutes. It is ready when it is well risen and starting to turn a golden-brown, but still doughy underneath.To serve, dust with icing sugar, cut into 6 pieces and top each piece with fruit compôte and crème fraîche.
