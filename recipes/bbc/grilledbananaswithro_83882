Insert a sharp knife into one end of the bananas to create a slit in the skin and insert the sprig of fresh rosemary. Heat a griddle pan until very hot.Place the bananas with the skin still on onto the griddle pan and griddle for 3-4 minutes each side, or until the skin is dark brown and starting to split.To make the toffee sauce, simply place the double cream, butter, sugar, treacle and golden syrup into a saucepan over a medium heat and bring to the boil. Stir well to ensure all the ingredients are combined and dissolved.To make the ice cream, tip the frozen banana chunks into a food processor. Add the vanilla essence, sugar and 75ml/2½fl oz of the buttermilk. Turn on the processor and let it run for 20-30 seconds.While the food processor is still running, gradually pour in the remaining buttermilk in a steady stream. Let the machine run until the mixture is smooth and creamy.Serve each banana in a bowl as you would a jacket potato: cut open down the centre, with the skin on. Pour over a spoonful of the toffee sauce and place a scoop of ice cream on top.
