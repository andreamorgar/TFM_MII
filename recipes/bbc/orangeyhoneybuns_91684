Grease the wells of a 12-hole muffin tray with butter.Mix together the sugar, flour, salt and yeast in a large bowl until well combined. Add half of the beaten eggs, then whisk using an electric whisk until the mixture is well combined and forms a sticky paste.Gradually whisk in a little of the remaining beaten egg. When the egg is fully incorporated into the mixture, add 1-2 butter cubes and whisk in until fully incorporated into the mixture.Whisk the remaining beaten egg and remaining butter cubes into the mixture in alternate turns, until the mixture comes together as a soft dough. Using a wooden spoon, beat the dough until smooth.Divide the dough mixture equally among the wells in the prepared muffin tray. Set aside in a warm place for about an hour, or until the portions of dough have proved (ie. doubled in size and filled the wells in the tray).Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.When the dough has proved, bake the buns in the oven for 12-15 minutes, or until well risen and pale golden-brown. Set aside to cool on a wire rack.Meanwhile, for the syrup, heat the sugar, orange rind and cold water in a pan over a low heat, stirring well. When the sugar has dissolved, bring the mixture to the boil and continue to boil for three minutes, or until the mixture has thickened and resembles syrup.Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the honey, orange liqueur and orange-flower water, if using, until well combined. Set aside until cooled slightly.Dip six of the buns into the cooled syrup and serve straightaway on serving plates with a spoonful of whipped cream.Pack the remaining buns into a 1 litre/1¾ pints sterilised jar. Pour in the remaining syrup and set aside for 20 minutes, then cover the jar and seal tightly. The buns can be kept in the fridge for up to one month.
