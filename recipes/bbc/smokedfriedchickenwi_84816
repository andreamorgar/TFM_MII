For the dressing, place all the dressing ingredients into a bowl and mix well.For the chicken, place the cornflour and sparkling mineral water into a clean bowl and whisk together vigorously until the mixture has a smooth texture.Heat the oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns golden-brown after 30 seconds (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous.  Do not leave unattended).Dip the chicken pieces into the batter, remove and shake off the excess mixture.Place the chicken pieces into the oil and cook for three minutes, or until the chicken has turned golden-brown in colour and is cooked through. Remove the chicken from the oil using a slotted spoon, drain on kitchen paper and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.To serve, place the chicken onto a clean plate with a small bowl of the dressing in the middle of the plate.
