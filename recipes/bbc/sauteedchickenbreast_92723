Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.Heat the remaining oil in the frying pan the chicken was cooked in and fry the onion, garlic and chilli for 2-3 minutes, or until softened. Add the tomatoes and cook for a further 2-3 minutes or until the tomatoes begin to break down.Return the seared chicken to the tomato stew and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.
