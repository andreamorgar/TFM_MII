Set the oven at  200C/400F/Gas 6.Put the sausages in a roasting tin large enough to take them in a single layer. If they overlap, they won’t cook properly.In a bowl mix the mustards, honey and lemon juice. Stir well and pour over all the sausages. Bake for 25-30 minutes, rolling the sausages over in the honey and mustard mixture once or twice during cooking, so that they eventually take on a sticky, glossy coat.Meanwhile, to make the mash, trim and scrub the carrots, slice into chunks and pile into a steamer basket or metal colander balanced over a pan of simmering water. Steam, covered, for 15-20 minutes or until just tender.Remove the carrots from the steamer and mash with a generous knob of butter. Divide the mash between 4 plates and pop the sausages on top.
