Add the rice and turn the heat down to very low. Mix with a wooden spoon until the rice is well coated with the butter and onion.Add the stock, little by little, stirring continuously until the liquid is absorbed, then adding more stock. Carry on adding stock, stirring and then continue to add more stock until the rice has a lovely, creamy texture. Make sure the risotto does not stick to the bottom of the pan.At the last minute, stir in the chopped lime segments, the lime zest, parmesan and the rest of the butter. If the risotto is too thick, add a few more spoonfuls of stock to loosen it up, then season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.For the moules mariniers with lemongrass and chilli, remove and discard the beards from the mussels and wash them in a bowl under cold running water, scrubbing to remove all traces of grit.

When the butter begins to foam, add the ginger, chilli and lemongrass and cook for two minutes. Add the mussels and coconut milk and cover with a lid. Cook for four minutes or until the mussels open. Discard any that remain closed.Remove from the heat and add the whipped cream and coriander and season with salt and pepper.Serve immediately, in a large bowl placed in the middle of the table for everyone to share with the lime risotto alongside.
