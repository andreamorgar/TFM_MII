Before cooking, wash your hands and put on an apron. Weigh or measure all the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7. Line a baking tray with baking paper and brush it generously with vegetable oil.Add the tomatoes to a mixing bowl then cut them into pieces with the scissors.Tear up the basil leaves and add them to the bowl.  Add a pinch of paprika.Cut off the roots and the dark green top of the spring onion with the scissors and throw them away. Then chop up the spring onion into small pieces and add it to the tomatoes along with the olive oil.Pop open the pepper by putting your thumbs on the stalk and pressing inwards, and tear about a quarter of it into bite-sized pieces and add this to the other ingredients.  Next add the tinned sweetcorn.Roll out the pastry onto a lightly floured surface.Trim the pastry into an even rectangle with the knife. Then use the tip of the knife to draw a border around the rectangle - like a picture frame - not cutting through the pastry completely.Put the pastry onto the paper-lined baking tray - you need to do this now as it’s much harder to move once the topping is on.Pile your vegetable filling into the central part of your pastry base and spread to the edges of the border. Bake for 15-20 minutes until the pastry is golden and risen. Serve your tart with carrot batons.
