Heat a griddle pan until very hot, then add the squid and chargrill for one minute on each side, or until the squid is just cooked.For the chilli squid, cut the tentacles off the squid, just below the eyes, being sure not to cut the ink sac. Be sure to remove the 'beak' at the base of the tentacles. Repeat with the reserved tentacles. Remove the 'ears' from either side of the squid body and pull away the skin with your fingers, then slice the body into rings.Season the squid rings and tentacles with the chilli flakes, salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan until smoking, then add the squid rings and tentacles and fry for 1-2 minutes, or until the squid is just cooked.To serve, pile both the black pepper and chilli squid onto a serving plate and garnish with  the lemon wedges.
