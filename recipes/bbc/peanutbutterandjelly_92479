Spoon over the topping mixture and spread evenly with a palette knife.Bake the cheesecake in the oven for 50 minutes to one hour, or until the cheesecake springs back when pressed lightly in the centre with a finger and a skewer inserted into the centre of the cheesecake comes out clean.When the cheesecake has cooked through, turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake in the oven to cool down (this will prevent it from cracking).
