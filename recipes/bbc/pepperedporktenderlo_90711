Remove the cling film and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the medallions for 3-4 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown all over and cooked through. Set aside on a warm plate to rest.For the chips, place the potato pieces into a roasting tin, drizzle with the olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Transfer to the oven to roast for 12-15 minutes, turning the potatoes occasionally to ensure they brown evenly.For the salad, combine all of the salad ingredients together in a bowl.To serve, place the pork medallions on a serving plate with the chips and salad alongside.
