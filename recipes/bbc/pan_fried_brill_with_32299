To fillet the brill, place the brill onto a chopping board and using a flexible filleting knife cut down the centre line from the head toward the tail.Place the knife slightly on its side in the centre cut then press down onto the bone and carve the first fillet away, using the bones as guide to make sure all the flesh comes away from the fish. The first fillet is half of the top side of the fish.Repeat to take the second fillet off the top side of the fish.Turn the fish over and repeat on the underside to take of two more fillets, giving you four fillets in total.Skin the fillets then trim any frill off of each side.Season the brill with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Heat a frying pan until hot, add the butter then add the brill and fry on each side for two minutes.Pour the olive oil in a non-reactive pan. Whisk in the lemon juice until well-combined. Add the chopped tomatoes, shallot and garlic.Heat the pan over a medium heat until the sauce vierge mixture is just warmed through. Add the tarragon, dill, chervil and chives and season to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside.To serve, place the brill onto the plate then spoon the sauce vierge over the top.
