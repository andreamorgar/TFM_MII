For the ganache, put the cream, orange zest, orange liqueur and glucose in a medium saucepan and heat until nearly boiling. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter.Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of gently simmering water. When melted, add to the cream mixture and stir until smooth. Pour the ganache into a small bowl and leave to set for at least two hours, preferably overnight.To make the passion fruit sauce, mix three tablespoons of orange juice with the arrowroot. Mix remaining ingredients in a pan and heat until simmering. Add the arrowroot and juice mix and stir until thick and glossy. Leave to cool until ready to serve.To make the ravioli, put the flour, butter, sugar, orange zest and vanilla extract into a food processor and blend until it forms a crumb. Gradually add the milk to form a ball. Remove from the food processor and, using your hands, bring together to form a dough. Knead briefly, wrap in cling film and set aside to rest.Divide the dough into four equal pieces. Either using a rolling pin or pasta machine, gradually roll each piece until you have four thin sheets of pasta (you might need to add extra flour to the machine to stop it sticking).Using a large circular pastry cutter, cut circles from the pasta sheets. Put a generous spoonful of ganache into the centre of each circle. Brush the edges with a little water (to seal) and fold over to create a neat semi-circular pocket. Using a fork, crimp the edges.Place on a floured baking tray.Once all the ravioli are made, pour a few inches of vegetable oil into a large pan set over a medium heat (take care – hot oil is dangerous. Do not leave unattended). Gently lower the ravioli into the hot oil and fry until golden on both sides (you may need to do this in batches). Use a slotted spoon to remove the ravioli then drain on a plate lined with absorbent kitchen paper.Serve the ravioli warm, dusted with icing sugar and cocoa powder and drizzled with the passion fruit sauce.
