For the biscotti, preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2. Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper.Mix together the flour, sugar and baking powder in a bowl until well combined.Whisk in half of the beaten eggs until well combined. Gradually add the remaining beaten egg, a little at a time, making sure all of the egg has been fully incorporated into the mixture before adding more, until the mixture comes together as a dough. (NB: You may not need to use all of the egg.)Add the cherries, hazelnuts and lemon zest and mix well.Divide the dough into six equal portions. Roll each portion into a sausage shape about 3cm/1¼in in diameter, using your hands. Gently flatten each portion of dough with the palm of your hand.Place each dough 'sausage' onto the prepared baking tray, leaving a 6cm/2½in gap between each portion of dough to allow for expansion. Bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes, until pale golden-brown.Remove the 'sausages' from the oven and set aside for 10 minutes to cool and firm up.Using a serrated knife, cut 5cm/2in thick slices from the dough 'sausages' on the diagonal. Arrange the slices onto the lined baking tray and return them to the oven for a further 6-8 minutes.Turn the biscotti over and continue to bake for 6-8 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown. Set aside to cool on a wire rack.
