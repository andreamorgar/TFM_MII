Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5 and lightly grease a 23cm/9in fluted flan tin or cake tin that's 4cm/1½in deep.In one bowl, mix together the ground almonds, sugar, plain flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, butter, and almond extract.Stir the dry ingredients into the wet, and whisk until just mixed.Pour the batter into the prepared tin.Arrange the figs cut-side up over the batter, pushing the figs gently into the batter.Sprinkle the remaining two tablespoons of sugar over the figs, then bake for about 30 minutes, or until the cake is set in the centre.Let the cake cool for ten minutes then turn it out of the tin onto a wire rack. Allow it to cool to room temperature before serving.For the dried fig chutney, heat the oil in a saucepan. Once hot, add the shallots and gently fry for 2-3 minutes. Add the rosemary, sultanas, raisins and sugar and fry until the fruit begins to caramelise. Add the rest of the ingredients, bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 5-10 minutes.Serve a slice of the cake on a plate with the chutney and slices of cheddar cheese.
