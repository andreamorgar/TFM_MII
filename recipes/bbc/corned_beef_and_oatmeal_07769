Melt the dripping in a hot saucepan.  Add the oatmeal and cook for 2-3 minutes then stir in the corned beef, breadcrumbs and raw carrots.Stir in the vegetable stock until well combined.Grease a pudding basin and spoon in the mixture.Fold a large piece of aluminium foil in half and grease one side with butter. Wrap the pudding in the greased foil, greased side facing into the pudding. (Pleat the foil a few times as you wrap it to allow room for the pudding to expand.) Secure the foil to the rim of the pudding basin with string.Place the wrapped pudding into a large steamer. (Alternatively, place the wrapped pudding into a large pan, pour in enough boiling water to reach halfway up the sides of the basin, then cover the pan with a lid.) Steam the pudding over a medium heat for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until cooked through, topping up the steamer with boiling water as necessary. (NB. The pudding is cooked through when a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.)
