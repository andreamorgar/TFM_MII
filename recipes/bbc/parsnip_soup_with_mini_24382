For the soup, melt half of the butter in a large saucepan until foaming. Add the parsnips and fry for 4-5 minutes, or until pale golden-brown.Add the shallots, garlic and thyme and fry for 2-3 minutes, then stir in the curry powder and fry for another minute.Pour in the chicken stock and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until the parsnips are tender.Add the double cream, cool the soup slightly and blend the soup in a blender until smooth.Strain the soup through a sieve into a clean saucepan and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Whisk in the remaining butter.For the mini crab beignets, heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer to 180C/350F. Alternatively, heat the oil in a deep heavy-based frying pan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)Heat the water and butter in a saucepan until the mixture boils, then boil for another minute.Remove the pan from the heat and beat in the flour and cayenne with a wooden spoon until smooth, or until the mixture comes away from the side of the pan.  Return the pan to the heat and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring continuously.Remove the pan from the heat and beat in the eggs, one at a time, beating well before adding the other egg.Stir in the white and brown crabmeat until well combined, then season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.Spoon the mixture into a piping bag and pipe 1.5cm/½in long sections into the oil and fry for 1-2 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. Remove the beignets from the pan with a slotted spoon, set aside to drain on kitchen paper and season with salt.To serve, ladle the soup into soup bowls, scatter over some crab beignet and finish with a swirl of double cream. Drizzle the soup with olive oil and sprinkle over the coriander cress and flaked almonds.
