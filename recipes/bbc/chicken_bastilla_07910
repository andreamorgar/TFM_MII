Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Add the chicken and fry, skin side-down for 2 minutes, or until crispy and brown. Turn over and cook for 2 minutes more, then transfer to a plate. Add the butter to the pan and, when it has melted, add the onions and sauté until soft. Add the garlic and spices (no need to soak the saffron) and fry for a couple more minutes.Return the chicken to the pan. pour over the stock and season to taste. Simmer, covered, for 30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender.Remove the chicken again and set aside. When it is cool enough to handle, finely chop it. Meanwhile, reduce the cooking liquid by half.Add the eggs to the cooking liquid and cook over a low heat until it resembles loose-textured scrambled eggs. Add the almonds and stir, then stir in the dates, orange blossom water, orange zest, chicken and finally the parsley. Remove from the heat and leave to cool.Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. To assemble the pie, use a 28cm/11in round ovenproof dish – you can use a ceramic quiche or flan dish or a metal tart tin.Brush a sheet of filo with melted butter. Drape it over the dish, gently pushing it into the corners without tearing it. Repeat with another sheet of filo, placing it at right angles to the first. Repeat with a further 2 sheets of filo, placing them on a diagonal angle.Spread the filling over the pastry. Fold over the overhanging filo, in reverse order – the filling should be just about covered by the filo. Cut the remaining 2 sheets of filo to fit the dish. Brush with melted butter, then cover the pie with the pastry, tucking under any corners. Bake for 30 minutes, or until crisp and brown. Leave to cool a little before dusting it with the icing sugar and cinnamon.
