Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5.For the loaf, season the chicken breasts with salt and freshly ground black pepper and rub with a little olive oil.Place the breasts into a roasting tray and place in the oven to roast for 20-25 minutes, or until completely cooked through. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly, then slice the breasts thickly and set to one side.Meanwhile, bring a small pan of lightly salted water to the boil and add the green beans. Boil for 5-6 minutes until tender. Drain off the hot water and refresh in iced water, then drain once more.Line a small loaf tin with cling film. Place the parma ham into the loaf tin, covering the bottom and sides, leaving a little excess hanging over the top edges.Place half of the chopped chicken pieces into the bottom of the tin and top with a layer of Stilton cheese slices. Top with half the green beans, laying them lengthways down the length of the loaf tin.Repeat with a second layer of chicken, Stilton and beans.Using the cling film for leverage, pull the parma ham over the top of the last layer of beans to enclose the layers with ham.Place two or three heavy tins on top to press down and compact the loaf and place into the fridge for one hour to set.For the salad, bring a small pan of lightly salted water to the boil and add the green beans. Boil for 5-6 minutes until tender. Drain off the hot water and refresh in iced water, then drain once more.Place the beans into a bowl and add the broad beans, rocket and walnuts.In a small clean bowl, whisk the mustard, vinegar and olive oil together then crumble in the Stilton cheese and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pour the dressing over the mixed bean salad and mix together to evenly coat.To serve, cut two thick slices of loaf per person and arrange the slices onto plates with a spoonful of salad alongside.
