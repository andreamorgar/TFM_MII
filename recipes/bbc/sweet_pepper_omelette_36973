Add the vinegar, and cook until evaporated. Remove from the heat and set aside, leaving the peppers in the pan.Beat the eggs in a bowl and season with salt and pepper.Return the frying pan to the heat, add the remaining oil and pour in the egg mixture. Cook, stirring a little with a spatula, until there is a crust on the underside, this should take about five minutes.Cover the pan with large plate or the lid of a large saucepan, and quickly turn it upside down to invert the omelette. Slide it back into the frying pan, crust-side up. Cook for a further 5 minutes, until the other side has browned. Cut into wedges and serve hot or cold with salad.
