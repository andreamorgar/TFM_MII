Trim off the tops of the leaves with a pair of kitchen scissors and rub each artichoke with the cut lemon to prevent them from discolouring.Finely chop one of the garlic cloves and mix it with the salt and the anchovy fillets in a bowl to form a paste.Add the chopped herbs to the paste with the pecorino and breadcrumbs; mix well.Rinse the artichokes under cold running water, shake off any excess water and gently prise the artichokes leaves open.Sprinkle the artichokes with a pinch of salt and rub the paste inside the leaves.Heat the olive oil in an ovenproof pan. Thinly slice the remaining garlic cloves and add them to the pan, then add the artichokes and potatoes.Add the white wine, let it bubble and then add the vegetable stock.Cover the artichokes with greaseproof paper and place a lid on the pan.
