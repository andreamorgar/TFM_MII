Heat a large saucepan and fry the chorizo for 3-4 minutes, or until crisp.Add the onion, garlic and chilli and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until softened.Add the paprika and stir until well combined. Place the tomatoes, chickpeas and chicken stock into the pan and bring to the boil.Reduce the heat and simmer for 4-5 minutes. Add the spinach and fold it through the stew.Return the mixture to the heat and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook for another minute to wilt the spinach, then season with lemon juice.For the chorizo-stuffed chicken, heat a deep fat fryer to 170C/340F. (CAUTION: Do not leave hot fat unattended.)Place the chorizo and butter into a food processor and blend to a purée. Add a little touch of lemon juice and black pepper, then spoon into a piping bag. Make an incision in the side of the chicken breast and pipe some of the chorizo butter into the chicken.Press the incision shut then dust with the flour. Prepare a plate of egg and a plate of breadcrumbs. Dip the chicken first in the egg, then the breadcrumbs. Place into the fat fryer and cook for 8-9 minutes, or until golden-brown and cooked through.To serve, cut the chicken in half carefully. Place the stew into a bowl and top with the chicken. Finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and scattering of cress.
