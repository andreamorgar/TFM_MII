Soak the sultanas overnight in the vinegar.The next day, remove the sultanas from the vinegar using a slotted spoon and set aside. Soak the slice of bread in the same vinegar. When soaked, squeeze out any excess liquid.Pound the soaked bread, parsley, capers, anchovies, cooked egg white, fennel seeds and N’Duja in a pestle and mortar to a paste.Spread the paste between two sheets of greaseproof paper and chill in the fridge until firmed up.Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.Blanch the broccoli florets in a pan of salted, boiling water for 3-4 minutes, or until tender. Drain well and set aside to cool.When the paste has firmed up, season the cod fillets on both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cut the layer of paste into four pieces that are the same size as each cod fillet. Place one on top of each piece of cod.Place the N’duja-crusted cod fillets onto a baking tray and roast in the oven for 6-8 minutes.Meanwhile, heat one tablespoon of the extra virgin olive oil in a frying pan and fry the garlic and chilli until the garlic is golden-brown. Add the pine kernels, reserved soaked sultanas and the broccoli and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes, or until warmed through.  Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.To serve, spoon the broccoli mixture into the centre of four serving plates. Place one N’duja-crusted cod fillet on top of each portion.In a bowl, whisk together the pan juices and the remaining tablespoon of olive oil until emulsified (well combined). Drizzle the sauce over the cod.
