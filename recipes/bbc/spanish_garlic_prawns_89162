Heat the oil over a gentle heat and add the garlic, chillies, paprika and onion. Cook until the onion is soft, without any colour.Add the prawns to the pan, and increase the heat slightly. Cook for 5-10 minutes (If you are using raw prawns, add to the pan and cook until the prawns have turned dark pink ).Serve with crusty bread to mop up the flavoursome juices.
