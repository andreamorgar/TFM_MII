Before cooking, wash your hands and put on an apron. Weigh or measure all the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.Pop the pepper by pushing down on the stalk with your thumbs until you push it inside – then tear the pepper carefully to make two even-sized halves. These are your boats. Knock the pepper halves upside down to shake out all the seeds and pull off all the pale soft bits.Add the tomatoes into the bowl, then chop them up with scissors. Add the olive oil and a pinch of pepper and stir well.Sprinkle in the pine nuts and tear in the basil leaves, then give the mixture a good stir.Spoon half of the filling to each pepper boat. Finally, crumble the goats’ cheese on top of the tomato mixture.Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the cheese topping is golden-brown. Serve with crusty French bread.
