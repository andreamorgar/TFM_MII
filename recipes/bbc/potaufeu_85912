Put the beef and the tongue in a very large pan and cover with cold water. Bring slowly to the boil, removing the scum that will form on the surface of the water, using a slotted spoon.Add the chopped vegetables to the pan along with the salt and freshly ground black pepper and the bouquet garni. Simmer, covered, for two hours over a low heat.After two hours, add the chicken and sausages to the pan. Simmer for a further two hours until all of the meat is tender and cooked through. Take the pan off the heat.Carefully remove the meat and vegetables from the pan and keep warm.Put the pan back on the heat, and, when simmering, add the spaghetti. Cook for a further 7-10 minutes until the pasta is cooked through.Serve the broth first and then the warmed meat on the side, along with some mustard and gherkins.
