For the pastry, place the flour, butter and sugar into a food processor and pulse until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add one of the eggs and pulse until the mixture comes together to form a rough dough. If the dough is too dry, add a bit of milk. Shape the dough into a ball and wrap in cling film. Chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.Unwrap the dough and discard the cling film. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and roll out until large enough to line a 30x20cm/12x8in cake tin. Line the tin with the pastry, then place into the fridge to chill for a further 30 minutes.Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.Line the chilled tart case with a sheet of greaseproof paper and fill with baking beans. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the pastry is lightly golden-brown.Remove the paper and beans and brush the pastry all over with the remaining beaten egg. Return the pastry to the oven for a further five minutes, until golden-brown. Remove the pastry from the oven and turn the oven temperature down to 180C/365F/Gas 4.For the filling, beat the butter and sugar together in a bowl until pale and fluffy.Mix in the ground almonds, then crack in the eggs one at a time, beating well between each addition until smooth and creamy. Fold in the lemon zest and the flour.Spread some of the raspberry jam generously across the base of the pastry, leaving a 2.5cm/1in gap around the edge.Spread the filling mixture over the jam and sprinkle over the flaked almonds.Bake the tart for 20 minutes, or until the filling is set and golden-brown. Allow to cool in the tin before serving.To serve, cut the tart into 5cm/2in squares.
