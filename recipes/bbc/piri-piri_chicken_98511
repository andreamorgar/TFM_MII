Put all the ingredients, except the chicken, in a food processor and pulse until you have a smooth marinade.Put the chicken in a shallow dish and pour over the marinade. Massage the marinade into the chicken as much as you can, then cover and leave to marinade in the fridge for at least 3 hours or preferably overnight.When you are ready to cook the chicken, either prepare a barbecue or preheat your oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.To barbecue, put the spatchcocked chicken on the grill and cook for around 5 minutes on each side over the direct heat, then move to the side a little to finish off – it will probably take another 20 minutes of regular turning. Spray regularly with water (or beer) if it is browning too quickly. Alternatively, roast in the oven for 30–35 minutes, or until the juices run clear.
