Place a wire rack in the base of a large pot.  Put the pot on the hob on a moderate heat.  Add the drops of essential oil to the bottom of the pot. Sit the scallops on the rack, cover and leave to infuse for 2-5 minutes, depending on the strength of flavour you would like to achieve.Meanwhile, preheat a frying pan until hot.  Remove the scallops from the essential oil.  Drizzle with the groundnut oil and season with black pepper. Fry for 30 seconds, on both sides, and serve.
