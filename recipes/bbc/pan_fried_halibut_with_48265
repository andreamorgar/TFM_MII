Add the cavalo nero and 75ml/3floz water and cook for 2-3 minutes until just softened and the water and butter emulsified.For the hollandaise, place the butter in a saucepan and bring to a simmer.Place the lemon juice and vinegar in a separate small pan and heat until just boiling.Place the egg yolks in a food processor with a pinch of salt and turn on.With the motor running, add the hot lemon and vinegar.
