Poach for 2-3 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked to your liking, then carefully remove from the pan using a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper.Repeat the process with the remaining two eggs.Alternatively, if using later, drop the poached eggs straight into iced water and chill in the fridge until ready to use.
