Preheat the oven to 180C/355F/Gas 4.Put the rice and two-thirds of the cream into a heavy saucepan and place over medium heat. Stir together and cook for 2-3 minutes. Mix well and then add the milk and all but two tablespoons of the sugar.Cook on low heat for another 10-15 minutes. Once the rice granules are soft and the liquid has more or less evaporated, add the remaining double cream and the rosewater.In a clean bowl, whip the egg whites to soft peak stage then beat in the remaining two tablespoons of sugar.Pour the rice pudding into a large oval or round ovenproof dish. Using a piping bag, pipe the meringue mixture on top of the rice pudding to form peaks. Alternatively you can spoon it over the top in peaks.Bake in the oven for about 8-10 minutes or until the meringue has become slightly golden in colour.Remove and allow to cool slightly. Serve garnished with fresh rose petals, if you like.
