Remove from the heat, cover and set aside to keep warm.For the sautéed vegetables, heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan, add the fennel, new potatoes and carrot and sauté for 4-5 minutes, or until softened. Drizzle a little balsamic vinegar and sprinkle the chives over the vegetables and cook for a further minute.To serve, slice the lamb into three or four pieces, place the sautéed vegetables onto a serving plate, place the lamb on top of the vegetables and pour over the red pepper sauce.
