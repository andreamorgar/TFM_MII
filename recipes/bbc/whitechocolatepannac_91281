Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.For the roasted figs, place the figs onto a baking tray and drizzle over the honey. Roast in the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until the figs have softened and the honey has caramelised. Set aside.Meanwhile, for the panna cotta, heat the cream and milk in a pan over a medium heat until the mixture is almost simmering.Reduce the heat to low and stir in the white chocolate and sugar until the ingredients have melted and the mixture is well combined.Remove the pan from the heat and add the soaked gelatine leaves. Stir until the gelatine leaves have melted then set the mixture aside until it has completely cooled.Pour the panna cotta mixture into ramekins, then chill in the fridge for five hours, or until set firm.To serve, dip the ramekin bases and sides in warm water to loosen the panna cotta from the moulds. Turn out one panna cotta into the centre of each of four serving plates. Place one roasted fig alongside.
