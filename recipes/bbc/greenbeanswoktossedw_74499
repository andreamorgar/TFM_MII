When the oil is hot add the beans and stir-fry quickly with a pinch of salt for one minute until wrinkled.Remove the beans and reheat the wok, adding the remaining vegetable oil and the garlic cloves.When hot, discard the garlic (it will have flavoured the oil sufficiently) and add the pork mixture.
