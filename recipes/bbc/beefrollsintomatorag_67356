Arrange the slices of meat on a chopping board or a clean work surface and flatten them with a meat tenderiser (if you don't have one, place a flat wooden spatula  over the meat and bash with the palm of your hand).  Season with salt and pepper, then sprinkle with the grated parmesan, garlic, and parsley.  Roll each slice up tightly and secure well with toothpicks.For the sauce, heat the olive oil in a large saucepan.  When hot, lower the heat, add the meat rolls and seal well on all sides.  Increase the heat again, add the wine and  simmer until it has reduced by half.  Remove the meat and set aside.Add the onion and celery to the pan and stir well.  Cook until the remainder of the wine has nearly evaporated, then put the meat back in the pan and pour over the  diluted tomato concentrate and the chopped tomatoes.  Season with salt and pepper and stir in the basil. Lower the heat and cover with a lid, but not completely, so some  of the steam can escape.  Cook gently for 2 hours, stirring from time to time.  Check the seasoning.Serve the tomato sauce with some cooked pasta such as tagliatelle or large rigatoni. Then serve the meat rolls as a main course with a mixed leaf salad.
