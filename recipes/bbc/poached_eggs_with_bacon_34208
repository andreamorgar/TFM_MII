Preheat the grill to its hottest setting. Put the tomatoes on a rack over a grill pan lined with foil. Season with pepper.Grill for 3 minutes, then add the bacon and grill for a further 4 minutes, turning the bacon after 2 minutes so that it is lightly browned on both sides.Meanwhile, half-fill a medium pan with water and bring it to the boil. Crack the eggs into two small bowls. Turn the heat down so that the water is bubbling very gently. Slowly add the eggs to the water and cook for 3 minutes or until the white is set but the yolk remains runny.Using a slotted spoon, scoop the eggs out of the water and divide between two plates. Add the cooked bacon and tomatoes. Season with a little salt and pepper and serve.
