Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4 and grease a 20cm/8in loose-bottomed square baking tin with butter.For the cake, mix the semolina, sugar, flour, ground almonds, baking powder and orange zest together in a bowl until well combined.Gradually stir in the melted butter and milk until you have a smooth batter.Pour the batter into the greased tin and carefully arrange the almonds on top in 4 rows.Transfer to the oven and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the cake is golden-brown on top and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.Meanwhile, for the syrup, heat the honey, water and orange blossom water in a saucepan over a low heat, stirring constantly, for 2-3 minutes, or until the mixture is smooth and has thickened slightly.When the cake is cooked, remove it from oven, prick the surface several times with a toohpick, and slowly pour the syrup over the surface of the cake. Set the cake aside to cool and absorb the syrup.To serve, cut the cake into 16 squares, so that there is an almond in the middle of each piece. Place a piece of cake onto each of 8 serving plates and spoon some whipped cream alongside.
