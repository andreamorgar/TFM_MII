Firstly make the sweet onion marmalade. Heat the oil in a pan, add the onions and fry for 1 minute. Add the sugar and caramelise lightly together.Pour over the vinegar and red wine, add the thyme and leave to cook over a gentle heat until reduced and has a jam consistency -  about 25 minutes (this can be made well in advance). Chill until ready for use.Lay out the pastry sheets and brush liberally all over with eggwash. Place a spoonful of onion marmalade in centre of each sheet, then top with goats cheese. Wrap up securely to enclose the cheese within using eggwash as glue.Heat the vegetable oil in a large pan to 170C/325F - you could bake them in the oven too if you wanted.Meanwhile for the salad, place all three salad leaves in a bowl. Top with the avocado, fresh pear and celery and season lightly.Make a dressing from the mustard, honey, balsamic vinegar, oil, salt and pepper. Pour over the salad, add the walnuts and dress on a serving plate (either individual or one large serving plate).Fry the goats' cheese parcels for 1-2 minutes until golden and crispy, remove and drain on kitchen paper and dress on the salad. Serve immediately.
