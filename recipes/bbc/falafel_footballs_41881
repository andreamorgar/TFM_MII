Before cooking, wash your hands and put an apron on. Weigh or measure all the ingredients. Brush a baking tray generously with vegetable oil.  Ask a grown-up to preheat the oven at 200C/400F/Gas 6.Start by placing the drained beans and the garlic clove in the plastic bag and mashing with the rolling pin then transferring into bowl.Ask a grown-up to help you use the scissors to cut off the roots and the dark green top of the spring onions – this is called topping and tailing. Finely cut up the rest of the spring onion and add to the beans. Then chop up the fresh coriander finely with the scissors and add it to the bean mash.Sprinkle over the dried cumin, you can add more if you really like the taste. Sprinkle over the plain flour and mix everything together well.  Now squeeze the mixture with your hands until it all starts to stick together.Divide the mixture into four equal portions and shape them in your hands into four balls – squeeze them again so that they hold their shape. Put on the oiled baking sheet and dab the top with a little more oil.Ask a grown-up to put them in the oven for 12-15 minutes. Leave to cool for about five minutes to allow them to set before eating. Serve warm or cold in pitta pockets with salad leaves.
