To make the sausage patties, simply combine the sausage meat with the garlic, fennel, chilli and black pepper.  With your hands form into eight even sized portions, and shape into patties.Heat one tablespoon of oil in a heavy fry pan over moderate heat, and the remaining oil, and fry the patties for approximately four minutes on each side. When golden brown and cooked through, remove them to a warm plate, and cover lightly with foil.Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 (or grill).Rub the peppers with a tablespoon of oil and roast in a hot oven, or under the grill until well blistered and blackened.Allow the peppers to cool, then peel, seed, and cut into strips.Pour the red wine into the pan to deglaze all the caramelised sausage juices.  Add the peppers and the chopped parsley, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Warm through, and then serve with the patties.Garnish with the sprigs of parsley.
