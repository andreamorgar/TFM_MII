Wash the redcurrants and put them, stalks and all, into a large preserving pan along with 500ml/18fl oz water and the mint sprig. Slowly bring to the boil.Stir and press the redcurrants to break down the fruit.Remove the pan from the heat and cool slightly. Tie a jelly bag (or a clean sheet of muslin) to something appropriate so it can dangle over a bowl. Carefully pour the contents into the jelly bag (or muslin). Cover and leave to drip overnight - do not stir or squeeze the jelly bag.When all the juice has dripped through, transfer the juice to a preserving pan, along with the sugar and lemon juice.Put a plate in the freezer.Place the pan over a gentle heat and cook, stirring frequently, until the sugar has dissolved.Bring to a rapid boil and boil for 10-15 minutes, or until setting point is reached. To test the setting point, remove the pan from the heat. Take your saucer from the freezer and place a drop of jelly onto the cold plate. After a few seconds push the jelly with your finger. If the jelly surface wrinkles then it has reached setting point and is ready. If it slides about as a liquid, then it hasn't reached setting point and should be returned to the heat and boiled for a few more minutes before testing again.Remove from the heat and stir in the chopped mint.Cool slightly before pouring into sterilised jars.Cover with a lid and label.
