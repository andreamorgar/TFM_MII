Stir with a wooden spoon, gradually drawing in the flour from around the edge of the well, until you have a smooth batter.Spoon the batter into the prepared tin and bake for about 40 minutes, or until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean.Leave in the tin for five minutes before turning out on to a wire rack to cool completely.For the roasted rhubarb, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.Place the rhubarb on a roasting tray, sprinkle over the sugar then drizzle over the apple juice.
