Add the syrup, eggs, oil and milk, mix with an electric hand whisk and pour into the tins.Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the cakes springs back when lightly pressed with your fingertips. Turn out on a wire rack, remove the paper and leave to cool.For the icing, break the white chocolate into a bowl.

Stir until melted and set aside to cool.Spoon the cream cheese into a bowl then gradually add the white chocolate mixture and stir until combined.
