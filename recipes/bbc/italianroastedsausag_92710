Stir until well combined and coated in the oil, then season, to taste, with salt  and freshly ground black pepper.Transfer to the oven and roast for 12-15 minutes, until the sausages are cooked through and the potatoes are tender and  golden-brow(Turn the mixture halfway through the cooking time to ensure even browning.)Meanwhile, for the pesto, place all the ingredients into a food processor and blend until a smooth paste is formed.To serve, spoon the sausages and potato onto a serving plate and drizzle the pesto around the edge of the plate.
