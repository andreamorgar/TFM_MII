Add a little more cider or water if the mixture becomes too dry. Stir from time to time.For the crisp black pudding, cut the pudding into 2½cm/1in chunks. Dust the pieces in flour, dip in the beaten egg and coat with panko breadcrumbs. Store in the fridge until ready to cook.For the pork chops, preheat a grill to high. Season the pork chops with salt and pepper.Place the chop in an ovenproof frying pan and place under the grill. Cook on both sides for 3-4 minutes. Remove from the grill and place on the hob. Add the butter and, when melted, use it to baste the chop. Set the chops aside to rest before serving.For the crisp black pudding, heat a deep fat fryer to 180C/350F, or heat the rapeseed oil in a deep-sided, heavy based pan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns golden-brown when dropped into it.

Remove from the fryer and drain on kitchen paper.For the spring greens, in a pan heat the butter with 50ml/2fl oz water to make an emulsion.
