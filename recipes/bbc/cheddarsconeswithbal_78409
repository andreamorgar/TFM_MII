Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.For the scones, mix together the flour, butter, egg and just enough milk to bind in a food processor to form a smooth, firm dough.Roll out some scone dough onto a flat surface. Mix in the cheese (reserving a little for later) and basil and roll out the dough to 2½cm/1in thickness.Using a medium-sized chefs' ring or cutter, cut out rounds and place onto a baking sheet. Brush with milk and top with the reserved cheese.Place into the preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until risen and golden.Meanwhile, for the onions, heat the oil in a saucepan, add the onions and fry them until soft.Add the sugar and let the onions caramelise for 2-3 minutes.Add the balsamic vinegar and reduce till thick and syrupy.Serve the warm scones with balsamic onions.
