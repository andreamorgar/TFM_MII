For the chilli-garlic sauce, put all the ingredients in a small saucepan with two tablespoons water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for a few minutes until the sugar is dissolved. Set aside to cool.For the yuzu mayonnaise, put the egg yolks, salt, vinegar, chilli-garlic sauce and yuzu in a food processor and blend. With the motor still running, gradually add in the vegetable oil until the mixture has thickened and resembles mayonnaise.For the squid, heat the oil in a deep fat fryer or a deep-sided, heavy bottomed pan to 190C, or until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns golden-brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not over-fill the pan or leave unattended).Sprinkle the flour onto a plate and season with salt and pepper. Dredge the squid rings in the flour until completely coated, shaking off any excess.Beat the eggs in a bowl, then sprinkle the Japanese panko breadcrumbs onto a separate plate.Dip each floured squid ring first in the beaten egg, then dredge it in the panko breadcrumbs until completely coated.Carefully lower the coated squid rings, in batches, into the hot oil. Fry for 2-3 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown. Remove from the oil using a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper. Keep warm. Repeat the process with the remaining coated squid rings. Season with salt.Place the squid onto a serving plate. Drizzle over the yuzu mayonnaise. Garnish with the spring onions, mint, coriander and fresh chilli and serve immediately. Place the lime wedges on the side.
