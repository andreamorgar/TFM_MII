Preheat the oven to 225C/425F/Gas 7.Score the skin of the duck breast with the tip of a sharp knife and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place the duck breast skin-side down into a cool ovenproof frying pan, then place on a medium heat for five minutes to slowly render the fat from the skin.Turn the duck breast over and place the pan into the oven to roast for 7-8 minutes, or until the duck is golden-brown and cooked to your liking. Remove from the oven, transfer the duck to a warm place to rest for five minutes, then cut into thick slices.Place the pan back over a high heat and pour in the red wine to deglaze. Reduce the heat and allow to simmer for five minutes, then add a splash of white wine and simmer for another 2-3 minutes. Add the butter and stir until the sauce is thick and glossy. Stir in the blanched peas and set aside.Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and add the cooked, drained noodles and fry for 2-3 minutes, turning over once, or until the noodles are golden-brown and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.To serve, slide the crisp noodle cake onto a serving plate, top with the sliced duck breast and pour over the red wine and pea sauce.
