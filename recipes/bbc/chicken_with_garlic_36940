Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper and dust with plain flour.Put the olive oil in a large, heavy-based frying pan and place on a medium-high heat. When hot, add the floured chicken and fry for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown and quite crisp.Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the garlic and most of the rosemary (reserve a few leaves to garnish). Cover with a lid and cook for 30 minutes, turning the chicken from time to time.Raise the heat to high, remove the lid, add the wine and simmer until it has evaporated.Check the chicken is cooked; the flesh should come away easily from the bone and there should be no sign of pink when you pierce the thickest part. Skim any oil from the top and set aside.Heat a griddle pan and oil the ciabatta slices. Grill the bread on both sides until crisp. Immediately rub them with the garlic and drizzle with a little of the reserved oil from the chicken pan.Serve the chicken with the bruschetta. Garnish with a few rosemary leaves.
