Place the peas, potato and stock into a small saucepan over a medium heat and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 6-8 minutes, or until the potato is soft.Add the Stilton and stir until melted, then season with freshly ground black pepper (no salt should be required, as the Stilton will make it salty enough).Blend with a hand blender until smooth, then pour into a bowl and garnish with chopped chives and a drizzle of olive oil.
