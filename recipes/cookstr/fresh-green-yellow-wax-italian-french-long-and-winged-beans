Bring 3 cups of water to boiling in a 3-quart saucepan or large skillet over high heat. Rinse beans well. Snip off stem ends and if dried or if you prefer, pointed tip. Trim off both ends of winged beans. Cut French or long beans into 4-inch pieces; cut Italian and winged beans into 2-inch pieces. If green and yellow beans are mature, they should be cut diagonally’ crosswise into 2- to 3-inch pieces or Frenched (split lengthwise). Add beans to boiling water; return to boiling. Cover, reduce heat, and cook 5 to 7 minutes for tender young green or yellow beans, French beans, Frenched beans, and long beans; 8 to 10 minutes for mature beans and Italian beans; and 15 minutes for winged beans, or to desired tenderness (see Notes).
