Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl. Add the butter and rub it in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse bread crumbs. Stir in the raisins and make a well in the center. Pour in the milk and stir quickly to make a soft dough. Gently and briefly knead the dough on a lightly floured work surface until it is smooth. Pat into a round about 1in (2.5cm) thick. Cut rounds from the dough using a 2½ in (7cm) diameter cookie cutter and place on a baking sheet. Gather up the scraps, pat out, and cut out more scones until all of the dough is used. Brush the tops lightly with the beaten egg. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden in color. Transfer to a wire rack and serve warm.
