In a small bowl, combine the sugar, honey, rice wine, hoisin sauce, and salt. Stir to mix well. Place the ribs in a nonreactive shallow bowl and brush the sauce all over the ribs. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 3 hours, turning occasionally. Cover the grill with aluminum foil and heat to medium. Grill the ribs, covered, for minutes. Turn over and grill for 40 minutes more. Carefully peel back the foil and set the ribs directly on the grill. Cook, uncovered, just until they are sizzling and browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from the grill, cut into strips, and serve.
