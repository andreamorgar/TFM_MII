In a small heavy skillet, combine the coriander, cumin, and peppercorns and toast over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant. Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining spices. Scrape the spices into a blender container or spice grinder and blend for at least 1 minute at high speed, until you have the finest-possible powder. Let the mixture settle for about 30 seconds before removing the cover, so the fine powder does not fly into the air. Use a dry pastry brush to press the powder through a strainer into a clean dry container. Blend and strain the larger bits again. Store in a tightly sealed jar away from light for up to 3 months. Fiery Curry Powder. Increase the peppercorns to 2 teaspoons and add ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes after the spices are toasted.
