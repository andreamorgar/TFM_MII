Discard any dark or limp leaves from the brussel sprouts and trim off their bottoms. Cut the sprouts in half through the core and then slice them crosswise, taking time to slice them as thin as possible. We call them "shaved" raw Brussels sprouts, which says how thin we like them, so make sure you use a sharp knife. Transfer the brussel sprouts to a mixing bowl. (You can shave the Brussels sprouts up to a couple of hours in advance and keep them covered in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve them.) Whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and white pepper in a large, wide mixing bowl. Add the shredded brussel sprouts to the bowl by the handful, tossing all the while. Once you've dressed the sprouts, portion them out into salad bowls, top each salad with ¼ cup of the crumbled cheese, and serve. Offer black pepper from the grinder at the table.
