Whisk the flour, yeast, and salt together in a large bowl, then pour in the milk and oil. Mix together with a large fork or your hands. Knead once or twice to form a ball. It may be sticky, but that’s okay. Oil a bowl and set the dough in it. Lay a sheet of waxed paper loosely over the top, then cover with plastic wrap. Place a clean dish towel over the bowl and allow to rise at room temperature and undisturbed for 24 hours. Turn the dough once in the bowl about 3 hours before you want to use it. The 24-hour fermentation process takes the place of kneading the dough. When you are ready to make your pizza, divide the dough in half on a lightly floured board, then proceed with your pizza making. (The dough can be frozen for up to a month; thaw at room temperature before using.)
