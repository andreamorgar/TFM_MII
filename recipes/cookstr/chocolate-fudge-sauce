In a medium saucepan, heat the cream and butter (and corn syrup, if making the glaze) over low heat until the cream is hot and the butter has melted. The mixture should form tiny bubbles and measure about 175°F on a thermometer; do not let it boil. Remove the pan from the heat, add the chocolate chips, and let them sit in the hot cream for about 30 seconds to soften. Add the vanilla and whisk the sauce until it is smooth and all of the chocolate has melted. You can use the sauce warm or let it sit at room temperature until it reaches the thickness desired. To store it, pour the cooled sauce into a small bowl, cover, and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. Reheat as much sauce as is needed by spooning it into a saucepan and heating over low heat to soften or melt. For the glaze, let it sit at room temperature just until it is thick enough to spread. Add any flavorings after the chocolate melts; when the sauce is still warm, flavorings blend in easily. Flavoring options include: 1 to 2 tablespoons dark rum, brandy, Amaretto, Kahlua, or Grand Marnier; 1 ounce chopped unsweetened chocolate for a bittersweet chocolate sauce; 1 teaspoon grated orange zest (good with the orange liqueur, too); 1 teaspoon instant coffee dissolved in 1 tablespoon water (good with the Kahlua); or ¼ teaspoon peppermint extract.
