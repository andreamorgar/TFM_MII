Variation: Horchata As anyone who lives within sniffing distance of a taqueria can tell you, horchata is an outrageously enjoyable beverage made from rice milk. On a hot day and/or with hot food, its sweet cinnamon coolness is most welcome. To make it, make the Rice Milk and soak I (3-inch) cinnamon stick in the water along with the rice. Include the cinnamon stick in the blender when pureeing the rice, along with a pinch of kosher salt and 4 tablespoons of your favorite sugar or natural sweetener, adding more to taste. Strain and enjoy immediately; or serve cold or over ice. Horchata will keep in the refrigerator for 3 days, but it does not freeze well.
