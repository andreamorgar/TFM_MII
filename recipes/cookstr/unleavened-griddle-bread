In a large bowl, combine whole-wheat and while bread Hours. Make a well in the center. Gradually add water and mix thoroughly until loose dough forms. Transfer to a lightly floured work surface and knead until dough becomes soft and elastic, 10 to 12 minutes. Shape into a ball and let rest 15 to 30 minutes. Knead again vigorously for one minute. Preheat cast-iron pan or griddle over medium high heat. Separate dough into 8 equal balls. Form into 6-inch rounds. Pierce each round all over with the tines of a fork. On a preheated griddle or skillet over medium-high heat cook rounds for 30 to 45 seconds per side, until dark brown spots appear. Serve warm.
