Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll the puff pastry on a lightly floured work surface into a 12in (30cm) square. Cut in half. Combine the sausage, onion, thyme, lemon zest, mustard, and egg yolk, and season with salt and pepper. Beat the egg. Form half of the sausage mixture into a 12in (30cm) long sausage shape. Place in the center of one pastry strip. Brush the pastry with beaten egg, roll up to enclose the sausage, and pinch the seam closed. Repeat with the remaining pastry and sausage mixture. Cut each roll crosswise into 12 pieces. Place the rolls, seam down, on the baking sheet. Using kitchen scissors, snip 2 cuts in the top of each roll. Brush with beaten egg. Bake for 10–12 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve warm.
