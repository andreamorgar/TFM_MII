Heat the oil in a large saucepan and cook the onion until tender and translucent. Add all remaining ingredients and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the sauce from the heat and use a handheld blender to process it to a smooth paste. (Alternatively, transfer it to an upright blender.) Return to pan and simmer gently for an additional 5 minutes. Separate the sauce into two containers. Use one to marinate and glaze the meat during grilling. Reserve the remainder to use as sauce at the table.
